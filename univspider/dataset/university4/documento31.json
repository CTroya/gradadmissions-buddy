One Thing Leads to Another Teaching AI to distinguish between causation and correlation would be a game changer— well, the game may be about to change. Columbia Team Wins Top 3 in the FG 2021 Families In the Wild Kinship Verification Computer science students won third place at the FG 2021 Recognizing Families in the Wild Challenge and presented their findings at the conference. About The group does research on foundational aspects of machine learning — including causal inference, probabilistic modeling, and sequential decision making — as well as on applications in computational biology, computer vision, natural language and spoken language processing, and robotics. It is part of a broader machine learning community at Columbia that spans multiple departments, schools, and institutes. Activities include seminars on statistical machine learning, several student-led reading groups and social hours, and participation in local events such as the New York Academy of Sciences Machine Learning Symposium.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
