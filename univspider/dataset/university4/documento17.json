Networking technologies play a central, driving role in shaping the direction of both the IT and communication industries. This track will help you develop leading-edge knowledge of these technologies. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Complete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above) Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement Satisfy breadth requirements Take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level At most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review 1. Breadth Requirement Visit the breadth requirement page for more information. 2. Required Track Courses Students are required to complete the following courses. Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead. Course ID Title CSEE W4119 Computer Networks COMS W4118 Operating Systems COMS W4115 Programming Languages and Translators 3. Elective Track Courses Students are required to complete 4 courses out of the following list; at least 2 courses must be 6000-level CS courses: Course ID Title CSEE W4140 Networking Laboratory COMS W4180 Intro to Network Security COMS W4261 Intro to Cryptography COMS W4737 Biometrics COMS W4995 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 4995 courses apply to this track.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below. Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review. Please note: Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements. 4 elective courses (12 points) selected from the list of Elective Track Courses; at least 2 of these courses must be 6000-level CS courses Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate courses The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist prepared TRACK PLANNING Please visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
