Thesis Track The M.S. Thesis Track The MS Thesis track is for students who want to concentrate on research in some sub-field of Computer Science.  You are required to arrange for a Computer Science Faculty member who agrees to advise the thesis and the rest of your course selection prior to selecting the track. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Complete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above) Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement Satisfy breadth requirements Take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level At most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review 1. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Visit the breadth requirement page for more information. 2. REQUIRED TRACK COURSES (9 credits) Students must take 9 credits of COMS E6902 Thesis. The points are typically spread over multiple semesters, e.g., 3 points each for 3 semesters or 4.5 points each for 2 semesters. No more than 9 points of E6902 may be taken. Sign up for the section number of E6902 associated with your thesis advisor. 3. ELECTIVE TRACK COURSES Students are required to complete 9 elective credits of graduate courses (4000-level or above) selected from Computer Science and/or related areas together with your faculty thesis advisor. These would normally be strongly related to your thesis topic. Up to 3 of these points may be in COMS E6901 Projects in Computer Science. Please note: The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist prepared Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements The elective track courses cannot be imported from another institution. 4. GENERAL ELECTIVES Students must complete the remaining credits of General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below. 5. THESIS DEFENSE A thesis proposal is presented to your thesis committee at least three months before your defense. Your thesis committee should have three members. Two of them must be internal, but one can be an outsider. Please bring the thesis defense form to your defense. Once completed, please submit the form to CS Advising via email: ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu. The thesis cannot be imported from another institution. A publication-quality thesis document is also published as a CS department technical report. Once completed, please upload your thesis into MICE. PROGRAM PLANNING Please visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently. Updated: 3/26/2024 Find open faculty positions here .

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
