In Memoriam: Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. — Personal Recollections Professor Steven Bellovin remembers his mentor Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., in a blog post about the computer scientist and author of The Mythical Man-Month. Papers from the Wu Lab Accepted to VLDB 2023 Four papers from the Wu Lab were presented at the 49th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB 2023). About The Software Systems group pursues fundamental research in all aspects of the design, implementation, analysis, verification, and evaluation of software systems. The group conducts research with systems at all scales, from handheld devices to cloud computing data centers. They take an experimental systems approach in building real systems to investigate new research ideas, create tools to enable developers to quickly and correctly build complex systems, and teach students how to do it.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
