The annual event explores machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision research and its applications. Voices of CS: Cheng Chi Second-year PhD student Cheng Chi talks about how his second project won a Best Paper Award at RSS 2022. About The group studies the computational foundations for visual and robotic intelligence. They investigate machines that are able to perceive their surroundings and interact with them too. The group of ten faculty often collaborate across the sciences and the arts. They leverage insights from both nature and math to advance the fundamentals of perception and interaction, and they also transfer their research to tackle practical challenges across disciplines. Several of the faculty are cross-listed with the Data Science Institute.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
