Christos Papadimitriou and Xi Chen Win 2022 ACM SIGecom Test of Time Awards Papadimitriou and Chen's influential papers settled the complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium. Henry Yuen Wins NSF CAREER Award The theoretical computer scientist will use the award to push the boundaries of quantum information science. About The group does research on the fundamental capabilities and limitations of efficient computation. In addition, they use computation as a lens to gain deeper insights into problems from the natural, social, and engineering sciences. The group is highly collaborative, both within Columbia and among peer institutions. They hold a weekly Theory Lunch and a bi-weekly Student Seminar. Most graduate students have (at least) two advisors and collaborate with several professors and other students. Some of the faculty are cross-listed with the IEOR department and the Data Science Institute.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
