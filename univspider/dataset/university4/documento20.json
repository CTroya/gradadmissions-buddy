The theory of computation plays a crucial role in providing solid foundations for all areas of Computer Science, including systems, artificial intelligence, security, and circuit design. This track will help you develop leading-edge knowledge of theoretical Computer Science and its applications. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Complete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above) Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement Satisfy breadth requirements Take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level At most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review 1. Breadth Courses Visit the breadth requirement page for more information. 2. Required Track Courses Students are required to complete the two following courses: CSOR W4231 and COMS W4236. Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead. Course ID Title CSOR W4231 Analysis of Algorithms I COMS W4236 Intro. to Computational Complexity 3. Track Electives Part I Students are required to complete 1 of the following courses: Course ID Title COMS W4203 Graph Theory COMS W4205 Combinatorial Theory COMS W4241 Numerical Algorithms and Complexity COMS W4252 Introduction to Computational Learning Theory COMS W4261 Introduction to Cryptography COMS W4281 Introduction to Quantum Computing 4. Track Electives Part II Students are required to complete 9 points out of the following Electives II list, excluding the course already taken; at least 6 points must be at the 6000-level: Course ID Title COMS W4203 Graph Theory COMS W4205 Combinatorial Theory COMS W4241 Numerical Algorithms and Complexity COMS W4252 Introduction to Computational Learning Theory COMS W4261 Introduction to Cryptography COMS W4281 Introduction to Quantum Computing CSEE E6180 Performance Analysis COMS W4995 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 4995 courses apply to this track. COMS E6204 Topics in Graph Theory COMS E6232 Analysis of Algorithms II COMS E6253 Computational Learning Theory II COMS E6261 Advanced Cryptography COMS E6291 Theoretical Topics in C.S. COMS E6901 Projects in Computer Science (Advisor approval required) COMS E6998 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 6998 courses apply to this track. CSPH G4802 Incompleteness Results in Logic STAT 4001 (previously known as SIEO 4150) Intro. to Probability and Statistics IEOR E4407 Game Theoretic Models of Operation IEOR E6400 Scheduling: Deterministic Models IEOR E6603 Combinatorial Optimization IEOR E6606 Advanced Topics in Network Flows IEOR E6608 Integer Programming IEOR E6610 Approximation Algorithms IEOR E6613 Optimization I IEOR E6614 Optimization II IEOR 6616 Convex Optimization IEOR E6711 Stochastic Models I IEOR E6712 Stochastic motels II IEOR E8100 Doctoral Seminar on Convex Optimization ELEN 6717 Information Theory ELEN E6718 Algebraic Coding Theory ELEN E6970 Resource Allocation and Networking Games * STAT 4001 taken Spring 2018 or prior may count as a substitute for Probability and Statistics/Advanced Data Analysis 5. General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elecevtives at the 4000 level or higher. These courses can be selected from the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department (4000 level or higher.) Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below. Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review. IEOR E4550y: Entrepreneurial Business Creation for Engineers is a known non-track course Please note: Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate courses Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist prepared TRACK PLANNING Please visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
