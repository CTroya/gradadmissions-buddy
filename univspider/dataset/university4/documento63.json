Academics The department is dedicated to making computer science accessible to students of all backgrounds. For majors, the department offers everything from introductory computer science and programming classes to advanced instruction in 11 research areas, with opportunities for undergrads to work on advanced research projects. For non-majors, the department presents a broad range of interdisciplinary offerings. Most graduates of the undergraduate computer science program at Columbia either step directly into career positions in computer science across industry and the public sector, where they are in high demand, or continue their education in graduate degree programs. For those wanting to deepen and expand their computer science skills, the MS program provides advanced education in several computer science tracks while offering opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research. Those pursuing PhD studies will work alongside world-class researchers to develop new techniques, cutting-edge systems, and innovative algorithms as they tackle challenging problems with critical impacts across science, technology, and society. Undergraduate Programs BS/BA degrees Graduate Programs MS Program MS Bridge Program PhD Program Affiliated Programs Computer Engineering Data Science Journalism & Computer Science Research Areas Founded in 1979, the department houses more than 60 faculty , who are thought leaders across all computer science fields.  With 11 research groups whose activities span the theory and practice of intelligent, efficient, sustainable, and secure information systems, the department is dedicated to excellence in research while including active undergraduate and graduate participation.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
