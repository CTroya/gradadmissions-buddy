Here are a number of campus maps: Large PDF , ASCII Map , Large Postscript Interactive map: Morningside Campus ( Computer Science ) Department office: The department office is at the entrance to the Computer Science Building, itself located in the lobby of the 4th floor of the Mudd Engineering Building. There are doors to Mudd on the 1st floor at 500 West 120th Street (near Amsterdam Avenue). The Mudd doors on the campus level are on the 4th floor. Starting at the main entrance to the campus at Broadway and 116th Street, walk along College Walk and turn left up the steps. At the top of the steps is a large building with a dome: Low Library. Take the walkway to the right of Low Library, and the Mudd building is at the end of this walk. Upon entering Mudd, turn right and then right again. This is the entrance to Computer Science. Computer Science Building Front Entrance CS Conference Room and Lounge: Follow directions to department office, then go through both the double steel-glass doors and double wooden doors, and head down hallway to left. The entrance to the CS lounge and conference room is to the right of the door leading outside to the courtyard. Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research (CEPSR): is the (modern looking) building just left (or West) of Mudd. Instead of entering the Mudd, turn left and walk up the ramp to CEPSR. The Computer Science Department is located on the 6th and 7th floors. Schapiro Center Davis Auditorium : The Davis auditorium is on the 4th floor (campus level), room 412 in the Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research (Schapiro CEPSR). The building is on 500 West 120th Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam, about half-way down the block on the south sideFrom the campus entrance, walk in along College Walk, head north up the steps, go around Low Library and to the back of Uris Hall (the Business School) to reach Davis Auditorium in Schapiro Hall.Entering the building from 120th Street, you will come through a set of iron gates. Right in front of the gate there is an elevator that will take you up to the 4th floor, where the Davis Auditorium is located (you may also use the stairs). Interschool Laboratory : The Interschool Laboratory is often used for lectures, program committee meetings and workshops. It is located on the 7th floor of CEPSR (see above). Once you exit the elevator, follow the directional signs. Find open faculty positions here .

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
