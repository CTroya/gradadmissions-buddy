Requirements FAQ FAQs for Current MS Students Have a question or concern about your program? You’re in the right place! If you can’t find the answer you are looking for here or on our CSMS Homepage , email CS Advising . Program Requirements: I am an incoming MS student registering for my first semester. What should I do to start planning my program? Here is our recommended game plan: Review the general MS program description & requirements at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/ . Choose your MS Track on MICE . (MICE accounts will be created for incoming Fall students in June or July and for incoming Spring students in January) Plan your required and elective courses for your chosen track. Discuss your plan with your track advisor . Identify any previously taken courses you can import to substitute for “required track” courses. Validate your course scheduling with CS-listed course offerings and the Registrar’s Directory of Classes. Keep track of your progress through Student Services Online (SSOL), your MICE account, and your degree progress checklist . What are the overall requirements of the program? You must complete a total of 30 or more graduate credit points at Columbia while maintaining a minimum grade point average of 2.7. You must also complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement, s atisfy breadth requirements , and take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level. The CSMS program is designed to take 3 semesters to complete. If you have questions or concerns about completing the degree requirements within this timeframe, please speak with your CS Faculty Advisor or CS Advising. What are my program options? You should select a concentration track in a field of your interest. The department offers the following tracks: Computational Biology Computer Security Foundations of Computer Science Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Network Systems Software Systems Vision and Graphics Each track has its own set of requirements and choice of elective courses. There is also the option of designing a Personalized or MS Thesis Track . If you are interested in the Personalized or MS Thesis Track, please contact CS Advising . What is a personalized Track? This track allows you to develop a specialized program not covered in the tracks described above. If interested in this track, please contact CS Advising . You must find an advisor who agrees to supervise your program, and then you develop your own customized MS program with your advisor. Can I write a thesis? Yes. If you want to write a thesis, you can select the MS Thesis track . Like the Personalized track, you will need to find a faculty thesis advisor and develop your program with him/her. The thesis track should include the 12-point breadth requirement, 9 points of thesis (E6902), and 9 points of other graduate CS courses selected with your advisor. A thesis proposal should be presented to your thesis committee at least three months before your defense, and a publication-quality thesis document is published as a CS department technical report. When and how do I select a Track? Please select your track in MICE . You are required to select a track as soon as your MICE account is created. (MICE accounts will be created for incoming Fall students in June or July and for incoming Spring students in January) If you want to change your track later, you can do so up until the beginning of your second semester. If you are an international student, please keep in mind that the request to change your track after the beginning of the second semester may not be granted. This rule applies to all tracks including personalized and thesis tracks. Who is my Track Advisor? Each track has one or two track advisors . You will be assigned an advisor after you choose a track on MICE. How many non-CS/non-track courses can I take as part of the program? Up to 3 points of advisor-approved CU graduate courses can be included. Please complete the MS elective approval form to request advisor approval and submit to ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu. To qualify, the course must be relevant to the CS MS track and technical in nature. How many project and research credits (E6901 or E6902) can I include in my 30 required credits? All MS students can take a maximum of 12 project/research points, 9 of which can be thesis points if you are in the MS Thesis track. Current AMR students will be registered by SEAS to be at full time status. It is NOT permitted to take COMS 6901 in addition to AMR credits. Can I waive a Breadth Requirement? Breadth may only be waived if you took the course at Columbia and received Advance Standing credit for the course in question. Please email ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu for more information on the Advance Standing application process.

A US citizen or a permanent resident can drop a course until the drop deadline (late November for Fall and late March for Spring) via submitting a RAF to CS Advising. Please keep in mind that even though it is still possible to drop a course, you will not get a refund for the course you are dropping after the Change of Program Period . If you want to avoid financial penalties for dropping a course, please finalize your schedule during the regular registration period or the Change of Program Period. If you are an international student, you may not be able to drop a course due to the full-time registration requirement. Please consult ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu. Should I register for COMS W4901 or COMS E6901? They are both graduate project courses, so I am not sure for which one I should register. All MS students should register for COMS E6901. If you have been chosen to work on a project, please email ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu and cc your project supervisor. We will give you the information you need for registration. Can I take on-campus courses in the summer? The ‘official’ line for the MS program is that no summer courses are guaranteed to be offered, but some are occasionally. If the course that you want to take is offered, you are allowed to register for it. Please visit the Summer Sessions website for more information. Credit Transfer: Can I transfer graduate credits for courses taken at another university? No, but you can waive courses from your track’s “required courses” section if you have taken similar courses at another institution. For the waiver to be approved, the previous course must be equivalent to what we offer here at Columbia, and the grade you received must be B or higher. Waiver requests are submitted through MICE. Forms are electronically transferred to the relevant course instructors for approval, and you will be notified by email of their decisions. If approved, you still have to complete a minimum of 30 credit hours to receive your degree, but you can take other CS courses in place of the waived requirements. Note that class imports must be completed during your first semester only. Go to MICE → Students menu → Course Imports → Add Course Import → Upload the necessary transcript and syllabus Can I transfer graduate credits for courses taken at Columbia? Yes.

You may count 1 D grade towards your CSMS. If you have an F for a course you need for a CS MS Requirement or credits, you will not be able to graduate. You must complete the remaining requirement(s) in the following semester. Please note that it is not possible to extend your program with ISSO or COMS to do this. The failed requirement must be completed via petition for a CVN course or via OPT for international students. Remember that your home country may have rules on degree verification for online coursework; you must make an informed decision on how to proceed. Students without visa requirements should also complete via CVN.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
