The copyright information depends on who currently owns the copyright. If the content of the technical report has not yet been accepted for publication by ACM, IEEE or similar organization, authors are the copyright holders. You retain that copyright when you submit the technical report, but the Department asks you to grant it certain rights, such as the right to include the technical report in collections of such reports or external listings. If the technical report is essentially the same as a paper published by ACM, IEEE or another publisher, the details depend on the publisher. Some publishers do not allow you to publish the content again. Others, like ACM, require you to add text to your document. WHO OWNS THE COPYRIGHT FOR STUDENT PROJECTS? Unless the student was paid and is thus a university employee, the student owns the copyright. If faculty intend to re-use the program for other purposes, they would have to get the student’s permission or have the student release the program under a suitable open-source license. It may well be worth discussing this with the student early in the semester. Faculty may refuse to supervise a project student who refuses to open-source the material (or create another mutually agreeable license), for example, but it would be unfair to tell the student after the add-drop period. The Columbia copyright policy speaks to this general topic: “Columbia will hold rights in copyright to works of authorship that are created at the University by faculty, research staff, and others and that are supported by a direct allocation of University funds, are commissioned by the University, make substantial use of financial or logistical support from the University beyond the level of common resources provided to faculty, or are otherwise subject to contractual obligations.” The seamless integration of ledger live desktop software download app enables users to conveniently access the platform, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for individuals to manage and exchange their cryptocurrencies effortlessly.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
