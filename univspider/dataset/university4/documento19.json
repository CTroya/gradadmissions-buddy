The track also includes courses in related fields, such as Robotics, Machine Learning, and User Interfaces. Many of the courses are taught by faculty in the Columbia Vision and Graphics Center . SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Complete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above) Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement Satisfy breadth requirements Take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level At most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review 1. Breadth Courses Visit the breadth requirement page for more information. 2. Required Track Courses Students are required to complete 2 of the following 7 courses. Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead. Course ID Title COMS W4160 Computer Graphics COMS W4167 Computer Animation COMS W4170 User Interface Design COMS W4172 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality COMS W4731 Computer Vision COMS W4732 Computer Vision II COMS W4733 Computational Aspects of Robotics COMS W4735 Visual Interfaces to Computers COMS W4771 or W4721* Machine Learning or Machine Learning for Data Science COMS W4737 (E6737) Biometrics * Due to significant overlap, students can receive credits for only one of these courses (either COMS W4771 Machine Learning or COMS W4721 Machine Learning for Data Science). 3. Elective Track Courses Students are required to complete 2 courses from the following list. At least one of these courses must be a 6000-level CS course. Course ID Title COMS W4160 Computer Graphics COMS W4162 Advanced Computer Graphics COMS W4165 Computational Techniques in Pixel Processing COMS W4167 Computer Animation COMS W4170 User Interface Design COMS W4172 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality COMS W4731 Computer Vision COMS W4733 Computational Aspects of Robotics COMS W4735 Visual Interfaces to Computers COMS W4737 Biometrics COMS W4771 or W4721* Machine Learning or Machine Learning for Data Science COMS W4772 Advanced Machine Learning and Perception COMS W4995 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 4995 courses apply to this track. COMS E6160 Topics in Computer Graphics COMS E6161 Rendering COMS E6174 Interaction Design: A Perceptual Approach COMS E6176 User Interfaces for Mobile & Wearable Computing COMS E6178 Human–Computer Interaction COMS E6731 Humanoid Robots COMS E6732 Computational Imaging COMS E6733 3-D Photography COMS E6734 Computational Photography COMS E6735 Visual Databases COMS E6737 Biometrics COMS E6901 Projects in Computer Science (Advisor approval required) COMS E6998 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 6998 courses apply to this track. MECS E6615 Advanced Robotic Manipulation *Due to significant overlap, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements. 5. General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with appropriate General Elective graduate courses; 3 credits at the 6000 level and 3 credits at the 4000 level or above. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below. Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to their Track Advisor for review. Please note: Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate courses The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist prepared TRACK PLANNING Please visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
