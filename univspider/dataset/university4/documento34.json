Here’s who will advise Mayor Eric Adams on artificial intelligence New York City has tapped Jeannette Wing and Clifford Stein to advise the city on artificial intelligence. About Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with the development of systems that exhibit behavior typically associated with human cognition, such as perceiving, learning, communicating, reasoning, making decisions, and acting in a physical and social environment. AI research at Columbia CS focuses on machine learning, natural language and speech processing, computer vision, robotics, and security. AI researchers collaborate widely within the university and beyond, contributing to applications in medicine, public safety, law, journalism, and other areas. Some AI faculty are cross-listed with the Statistics department, Electrical Engineering department, and the Data Science Institute.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
