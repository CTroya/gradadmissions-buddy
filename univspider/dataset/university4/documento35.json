Security considerations pervade personal, corporate, military, governmental, and national infrastructure systems and networks. This track will help you develop leading-edge knowledge in security. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Complete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above) Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirement Satisfy breadth requirements Take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level At most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review 1. Breadth Courses Visit the breadth requirement page for more information. 2. Required Track Courses Students are required to complete the following 5 courses: COMS W4118 (OS), COMS W4156 (Adv. Software Engineering), COMS W4181 (Computer Security I), COMS W4182 (Computer Security II), and either COMS W4261 (Introduction to Cryptography) or COMS E6185 (Intrusion Detection). Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead. For students starting the program in Fall 2018 and later: Course ID Title COMS W4118 Operating Systems COMS W4156 Adv. Software Engineering COMS W4181 Computer Security I COMS W4182 Computer Security II Either COMS W4261 or COMS E6185 Introduction to Cryptography or Intrusion Detection For students who started the program prior to Fall 2018: Course ID Title COMS W4118 Operating Systems COMS W4156 Adv.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. Three credits must be from a graduate CS course and can be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below. Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review. **Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements. Please note: For the Security track, you must have six points at the 6000 level; at least three of these 6000-level points must be selected from the list of Elective Track Courses. Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate courses The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist prepared TRACK PLANNING Please visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
