CertiK, a Web3 Security Company, Doubles Its Valuation to $2 Billion in Just 3 Months Assistant Professor Ronghui Gu's blockchain security firm CertiK is considered a unicorn company. About The security group works on a diverse set of security and privacy issues arising across the software/hardware stack. The key research goal of the group is to design, develop, and deploy principled solutions for improving the security and privacy aspects of computer systems. The group has a broad set of expertise ranging from systems security to designing privacy policies. It is a highly collaborative group and most of their students are co-advised by multiple faculty members.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
