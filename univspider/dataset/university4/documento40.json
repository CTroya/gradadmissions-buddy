CS Placement Statistics Career Counseling Resources for CS Students Our goal in the Department of Computer Science is to equip students with the skills they need for a successful career in research, industry, or academia and help jumpstart their careers by connecting them with a wide range of employment options. Students will have a number of resources available to them as they prepare for employment. The Graduate Career Placement (GCP) Team works to connect graduate students at Columbia Engineering with a variety of employers and employment opportunities. Additionally, graduate students of the Department of Computer Science will partner with the department’s Career Placement Officers (CPOs) throughout their program to ensure they are prepared for the next steps in their professional careers. The CPOs will be the student’s first point of contact for their career development needs. The Center for Career Education (CCE) offers a wide range of resources for undergraduate job seekers. The CCE manages LionShare , the job and internship database available for undergraduate students at Columbia Engineering. Students can check LionShare regularly for updated job listings as new opportunities are posted daily. The Department of Computer Science works in conjunction with the GCP Team and the CCE to host numerous career-related events each semester, including employer info sessions, tech talks, alumni panels, and much more. We encourage students to participate in as many of these events as possible — the more students learn about the job search process, the savvier they will be when it comes time to apply! For a comprehensive list of upcoming events, graduate students can visit Career Connect , while undergraduate students can visit the CCE event calendar .

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
