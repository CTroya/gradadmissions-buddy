Stephen Edwards Wins Test Of Time Award At ESWEEK ’23 The paper \"Predictable Programming on a Precision Timed Architecture\" from the CASES 2008 Conference was honored with a Test of Time Award. Martha Kim and Baishakhi Ray Named  Provost Awardees The small-grants program is designed to support faculty who contribute to the diversity goals of the University by their research, teaching, and mentoring activities. About Computer Engineering is where the study of hardware and software interfaces come together. It draws on techniques from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to imagine and realize the next generation of devices and chips. The group researches the platforms that power all forms of computation – from IoT to mobile, data centers to supercomputers. Students learn how to design, create, and test software, hardware, and system designs for applications in business, industry, and government. The various research groups collaborate in diverse areas including computer architecture, hardware security, networks, and distributed embedded systems.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C.
