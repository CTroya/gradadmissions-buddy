We understand that students experience academic difficulty for a variety of reasons. This monitoring and the associated status are not meant to punish or stigmatise. Instead, the goal is to successfully identify and resolve the challenges so that all students can complete their degrees successfully. As noted in the program requirements, the department allows a maximum of one D grade towards the CS MS. If a student earns additional D grades for a course, these cannot be counted towards the CS MS program. The course(s) must be repeated or substituted with a suitable, approved alternative. MASTERS STUDENT ACADEMIC STANDING STATUS For MS students experiencing academic difficulty, we assign one of three statuses: Strict Probation – For cumulative GPA equal to or below 2.49 Probation – For cumulative GPA between 2.50 and 2.69 For both these statuses, the student will be required to meet with the Director for Student and Academic Services to discuss their strategies for recovery and to restore their GPA to good standing of at least 2.7 in a timely manner. Students who fail to do so are subject to dismissal from the program. Warning – For cumulative GPA between 2.7 and 2.99 This status reflects the need for caution as the student’s GPA is in danger of dropping below the minimum 2.7 permitted for the MS Program. In this case, students are strongly encouraged to meet with the Director for Student and Academic Services or their CS Advisor. This status is removed once the student earns a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher. Updated 3/26/2024 Find open faculty positions here .

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.” This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity. I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia. Sincerely, Mary C. Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor      -   Location:  \n                 Speaker: },  \n                 Series:   }  Bio }         Interests:    }  Courses This Semester   ( -)   } Close"
