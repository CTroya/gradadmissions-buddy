professional development programming that emphasizes the benefits and challenges of diversity, inclusivity and culture. The NRMN Unconscious Bias Course will help you address your personal unconscious bias, teach you about microaggressions, provide a solutions toolkit, develop your self-awareness, and discuss bias and disparities in medicine and health care. A certificate is awarded upon completion of these modules. The course may be completed all at once or each module may be taken separately. There is no set completion window, but all five modules must be completed to receive credit for the course. Each module takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. Stanford University: VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab See Bias | Block Bias Tools The VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab at Stanford University generates foundational research to advance women’s leadership by diagnosing barriers and developing and evaluating interventions to get beyond barriers, and disseminates research-based solutions by bridging the gap between research and practice. The lab has a collection of See Bias | Block Bias Tools that include diagnosing bias, assessing performance and potential, block bias, the redesigning, redefining work videobook, and several related video resources. Government of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs Program – Unconscious Bias Training There is overwhelming scientific evidence that unconscious bias may influence peer review and the evaluation and selection of candidates from graduate admissions through faculty hiring. This online unconscious bias training module , provided by the Government of Canada, explains what unconscious bias is, outlines how it can affect the peer review process, and suggests ways to mitigate the influence of unconscious bias. Though focused on peer review, this online module includes content that is transferable to other areas of academia including graduate admissions, postdoc selection, and faculty hiring. UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Implicit Bias Video Series This publicly accessible video series begins with an introductory video that describes how biases and heuristics can influence our decision-making and behavior without us even knowing it. It is then followed by six short video lessons on the following topics: Lesson 1 : Schemas (mental short-cuts that help us navigate the world around us) Lesson 2 : Attitudes and Stereotypes Lesson 3 : Real World Consequences Lesson 4 : Explicit vs. Implicit Bias Lesson 5 : The IAT (Implicit Association Test – learn more about the IAT at Project Implicit ) Lesson 6 : Countermeasures Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ leadership.
