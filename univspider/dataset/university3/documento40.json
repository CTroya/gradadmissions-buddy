Professional skills are sought by employers in addition to discipline-specific knowledge and expertise. But how do you highlight these skills you already have and how do you carve out time to build the ones you need? In this session you will learn how flexible experiential opportunities contribute to skills that can position you as a top candidate. We’ll explore ways you can efficiently acquire and practice these skills that will complement your research and empower you for your future.
