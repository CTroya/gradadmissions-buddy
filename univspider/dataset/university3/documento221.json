Congratulations on your acceptance into Cornell…and welcome! We are excited that you will begin your graduate program soon and look forward to working with you. The goal of the Graduate School Orientation at Cornell is simple: We want to warmly welcome you to campus and help your transition to graduate school by introducing you to the values, expectations, and resources of an inclusive Cornell community that will be your home for the duration of your degree program.  You will also learn about graduate study at Cornell along with expectations and tips for success as a new graduate student. We will introduce you to valuable resources and services to help you throughout your time at Cornell. Orientation does not replace your field’s orientation program; it supplements it. We hope it will help you experience the benefits of a larger, interdisciplinary community. Please consult your field’s website for field-, college-, and program-specific orientation programs. Please also make sure to keep track of your new student to do list. In late April, students will receive instructions directly for Graduate School Orientation via email. As details are refined, this website will be updated. Expect a complete schedule by July 1. Fall 2024 Orientation Highlights: Dean’s Welcome – August 22, 2024 The formal program features Cornell President Martha Pollack, Graduate School Dean and Vice Provost for Graduate Education Kathryn J. Boor and a panel of esteemed faculty and students. Grad Connect: A Resource Fair for Graduate and Professional Students – 2024 This collaborative resource fair will allow graduate and professional degree students from across programs to engage with each other while learning more about the resources, offices, and organizations that help support their development and progression at Cornell. Open to incoming and current students. Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series (via Zoom) – 2024 This workshop series is designed exclusively for first-year graduate and professional students and covers topics like understanding doctoral funding, mentoring, and much more. Sessions are all online via Zoom. Primer session details Community Events for New Graduate and Professional Students – 2024 The Big Red Barn, Graduate and Professional Student Center, will provide connection opportunities for all incoming students before the semester begins through the first two weeks of classes. Exact details will be available in June, including trivia night, a language mixer, socials, TGIF, and more! For Our International Student Community: The Office of Global Learning’s orientation is for first year international graduate and professional students. It gives students an early start on their Cornell experience by introducing them to important resources for international students and helping them connect with their classmates from around the world. The English Language Support Office provides writing, speaking, and language support to Cornell graduate and professional students who use English as an additional language. Attend an online ELSO Info Session to meet the ELSO faculty and learn about ELSO courses, tutoring programs, workshops, and conversational English support. Find Your Community Knowing where to look can give you a head start With 23,600 students, Cornell is large. One tip for incoming students is to establish your networks early by getting out and meeting new people. The programs, organizations, and resources below are designed to bring people together. Big Red Barn Graduate and Professional Student Center . The Barn is the heart of the graduate and professional community with numerous events scheduled throughout the fall semester. Student Groups . With over 1,000 student groups, find a group that corresponds to your personal or professional interests. Several upcoming events are listed below. Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GPSA) . Cornell’s system of governance includes an active student component. Becoming part of the GPSA is a great way to meet people. Graduate and Professional Student Diversity Council . Help advance a sense of community, professional excellence, and a climate of inclusion for all graduate and professional students, but especially for those from marginalized communities and backgrounds historically underrepresented in the academy. Student Communities . Review our short list of student groups and links to other places to find community.
