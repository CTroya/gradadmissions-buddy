Society Scholars The Bouchet Society seeks to develop a network of preeminent scholars who exemplify academic and personal excellence, foster environments of support, and serve as examples of CLASS : C haracter, L eadership, A dvocacy, S cholarship, and S ervice. In the spirit of Dr. Edward A.

Harris , History Ph.D. James Harris, History Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ leadership.
