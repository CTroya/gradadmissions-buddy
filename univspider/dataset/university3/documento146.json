Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Tuition Rates Cost of Attendance Cost of Attendance Each year, the Graduate School, with the Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment, prepares a student expense budget defining standard allowances for education costs for graduate and professional students. Tuition and other budget figures for the academic year are listed Graduate Students page of the Financial Aid website . Please note: housing, dining, and personal expenses will be higher for programs offered in NYC. The cost of attendance reflects estimated expenses prior to financial aid. Please review a detailed breakdown of the estimated cost of attendance and reference the Financial Aid FAQ for more information. Housing and Dining (Room & Board) The housing and dining allowances should permit a student comfortable, but modest, housing and a balanced diet. Your living costs will depend on your lifestyle and living arrangements. Discretionary lifestyle choices cannot be subsidized by federal or private education loans. Books and Supplies The allowance for books and supplies is sufficient for the purchase of all required books and supplies. Personal and Miscellaneous Expenses The personal allowance covers necessary student-related living expenses other than room and board and student health insurance, such as routine costs of transportation to and from campus (including parking fees) and basic telephone service. Budgeting Your education-related costs may be different from the budget we use for financial aid purposes. Please remember that you cannot use education loans (even private education loans) to cover costs above our published budget. You may have to plan carefully to ensure that you can meet all your expenses during the year. Additional Expenses Additional expenses, up to but not exceeding the amount listed below, can be used to increase the cost-of-attendance amount. However, this is determined on a case-by-case basis after a student submits appropriate documentation and completes the budget-increase form, available on the Financial Aid website. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ leadership.
