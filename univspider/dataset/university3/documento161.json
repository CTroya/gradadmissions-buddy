Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Apply Important Application Policies Important Application Policies Deadlines Application deadlines vary by field. Please review field listings for the most current dates. Applying to Multiple Fields You may submit one application for a given term; multiple applications will not be processed. If you are not offered admission to your first choice program or have changed your mind about which program you want to apply to, you may contact one additional graduate field and ask to have your application reviewed. If the new field’s deadline has not passed and that field is willing to review your application, they should contact the Graduate School Admissions Office to initiate the transfer. Applications cannot be transferred between the Graduate School Admissions Office and other Cornell admissions offices including Cornell SC Johnson MBA Admissions, Cornell Tech Admissions, Cornell Law School Admissions, College of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) Admissions, Weill Cornell Admissions, Undergraduate Admissions, or the School of Continuing Education. These programs use different admissions systems run by different offices and review applications on different timelines. An application can be made to major fields only. Please review the field of study listing to verify that you are applying to a major field. Credentialing Services Cornell University expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents, credentialing services, or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services violates university policy, and may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the university. Online Courses if Outside of the U.S. Cornell is committed to compliance with all export control regulations, including U.S. sanctions. Any individual located in the following regions must receive written approval from Cornell’s Export Control and Compliance Officer prior to enrolling in an online course: Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Russia, Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk. Unsolicited Application Materials Publications, award certificates, resumes, theses, and similar materials should not be sent unless prior approval has been given by the field of study to which you are applying. Mail any approved materials directly to the graduate field, not to the Graduate School. Admissions Review Admissions review committees may include faculty, staff, and current graduate students. All members of an admissions committee are instructed to respect applicant privacy and the rights of enrolling graduate students under University policy and in accordance with FERPA. Notification Contact the field to which you are applying for its notification timeline. In most cases, offers of financial aid are made no later than April 1. Deferring an Admission Offer Generally, you are offered admission for a particular semester. If you want to defer admission, you must receive approval from your graduate field. Why should you consider Cornell? Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ leadership.
