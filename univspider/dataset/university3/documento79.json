Through a partnership with the Cornell Office of Federal Relations and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, the Graduate School sponsors doctoral students to participate in the annual AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) CASE (Catalyzing Advocacy in Science & Engineering) Workshop and the Cornell Doctoral Student Advocacy Day in Washington D.C. About the AAAS CASE Workshop Sponsorship to participate in the AAAS CASE Workshop is open to domestic doctoral students in STEM and social science graduate fields with limited prior experience and knowledge of science policy and advocacy who want to learn more about science policy. This program is organized to educate STEM and Social Science graduate students who are interested in learning about the role of science in policy-making, to introduce them to the federal policy-making process, and to empower them with ways to become a voice for basic research throughout their careers. Participants learn about the structure and organization of Congress, the federal budget and appropriations processes, and tools for effective science communication and civil engagement. In addition, students participate in interactive seminars about policy-making and communication. About the Cornell Doctoral Student Advocacy Day Cornell doctoral students selected to participate in the AAAS CASE Workshop join other Cornell doctoral students to engage in meetings with elected Members of Congress, Congressional staff, and current policy fellows.
