Creating this environment supports the full participation of all members of the campus community in the academic, research, and work life of the University. Diversity and inclusion of different perspectives, experiences, and abilities is integral to the process of rigorous inquiry which is foundational to the University. Access UChicago Now (AUN) is a coalition of University units, divisions, and schools that provides leadership and transparency regarding accessibility for the campus community. AUN works to empower units, divisions, and schools to make University education, research, work, events, and other programs and services that are a part of University life accessible to members of the campus community of differing abilities. AUN engages in this work by gathering information from campus partners and members of the campus community and then synthesizing this information to inform current priorities, which are set and enacted by members of AUN and campus partners.
