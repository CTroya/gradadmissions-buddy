Our departmental Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) plan , which has been verified by BPCnet.org , aims to foster an inclusive environment where students from all backgrounds can achieve their highest potential. The departmental BPC plan builds on existing strengths and collaborations, while fostering new efforts.  It will grow and evolve based on community engagement, stakeholder feedback, and impact assessment.  Community input is vital, it can be provided here , and when normal operations resume via town halls and topical meetings. Useful references: BPCnet.org is a national clearinghouse to learn about and engage with ongoing projects to address underrepresentation in computing. Also here is a helpful article from CACM on BPC. The BPC Plan was assembled by the following members of the department: · David Cash (CS Faculty) · Michael J. Franklin (CS Chair) · Henry Hoffmann (CS Faculty & PSD Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Coordination Team Member) · Randall Landsberg (BPC Lead) · Julia Lane (Data Science Institute) John Crerar Library Building 5730 South Ellis Avenue Chicago IL 60637 Main: 773.702.6614 cswebmaster@cs.uchicago.edu © 2024 Copyright University of Chicago About Research Academics People News & Events Admission Student Organizations Contact Non-Discrimination Statement Accessibility Get Updates Enter email address Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
