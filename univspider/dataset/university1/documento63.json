Computer scientists work tirelessly to anticipate emerging threats and build new protections against them, before malicious agents can take advantage. New tools protect both individual users and entire computing systems from attack and leaks of private information, enabling the benefits of these innovations to thrive without unintended consequences. UChicago CS researchers address these hazards with a broad spectrum of approaches, including cryptography, machine learning, user-centered design, and data science. They’re building cutting-edge protections against security flaws in the latest technologies, such as Internet of Things devices, quantum computers, and machine learning models and systems. They’re designing new privacy mechanisms that raise users’ awareness of how their data is collected online and in the physical world and how they can best protect themselves against invasive technology. They’re also developing new technologies to improve users’ safety and security online, including technologies for improving digital literacy and combating online censorship.
