The cloud has shifted computing cycles to massive data centers, while edge computing decentralizes data processing and machine learning to individual devices. The Internet and communications technologies continue to expand and evolve, becoming more and more essential for work, education, and entertainment. And as Moore’s Law reaches its end, new architecture challenges arise to continue advancements in speed and efficiency. University of Chicago computer scientists innovate across all of these areas. Researchers develop new approaches to reduce the fragility and complexity of computing systems, improve their energy consumption and ecological footprint, dependability, and lifetime, and create new capabilities for data management, distributed systems, operating systems, high performance computing, and more. UChicago is a leader in the new paradigm of quantum computing, with experts constructing the architecture, software, and algorithms of this emerging field. And faculty are experts in wired and wireless networks, studying the performance, security, and applications of the technologies that connect the modern world.
