Most of these events happen through the following student organizations which operate under the auspices of the department: ACM-W , focused on Women in Computing Asynchronous Anonymous , which hosts student-led workshops CompileHer , focused on teaching computing and technology to middle school girls. Uncommon Hacks , which runs major hackathons throughout the year. Students interested in getting involved in these organizations should reach out to them directly. These organizations operate under the umbrella of a single Recognized Student Organization, the CS Student Activities Council (CS-SAC). Students can also reach out to the CS-SAC to find out how to get involved in extracurricular activities related to CS and technology. The organizations in the CS-SAC also run weekly Hack Nights, an informal social event on Friday evenings (5 p.m. – 8 p.m.) students interested in technology or computer science can hang out or just enjoy some free food while working on homework or personal projects. If you’ve never attended a Hack Night, make sure to be there by 5:30pm, which is when attendees introduce themselves.
