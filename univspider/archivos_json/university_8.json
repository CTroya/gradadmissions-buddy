If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students.

Thanks in large part to Ken Griffin ’s transformative generosity, along with that of many other donors who support our groundbreaking financial aid program, twenty-four percent of students pay nothing to attend, and more than half receive need-based scholarships. So, yes—you can afford Harvard. Frequently Asked Questions How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions? Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Is there financial aid available for foreign students? Yes, financial aid is available for foreign students on exactly the same basis as for American students. Although foreign students are not eligible for any federal funding, the College has its own job and scholarship money available to foreign students. What happens if I miss the financial aid deadline? Prospective students who complete the financial aid application by the financial aid deadline will receive their financial aid decisions at the time that admissions decisions are released. If you complete your application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, you just may experience a delay in receiving your financial aid decision. How can I see what is missing/received and when? We are not able to track financial aid application materials for prospective students until they have been admitted. If a student is admitted and indicated they wished to apply for aid, we will let them know at that point what has been received or is missing. For current students, you can see what is missing and/or received by logging into my.harvard. We will not begin tracking documents for the next academic year until mid-February before that year starts, at which time we will post which documents are received/missing on your my.harvard.edu portal. Until that point, the documents showing on your my.harvard portal will be those from this current school year. How do I apply for aid? You can find our financial aid application instructions (which apply to all students, regardless of country of residence or citizenship status) here .

We seek promising students who will contribute to the Harvard community during their college years, and to society throughout their lives. While academic accomplishment is important, the Admissions Committee considers many other factors—strong personal qualities, special talents or excellences of all kinds, perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances, and the ability to take advantage of available resources and opportunities. First-Year Application Requirements All first-year applicants—both international and U.S. candidates—must complete the Common Application or Coalition Application by Scoir , along with the required supplements. You will need to submit: Common Application or apply Coalition, Powered by Scoir.

Restrictive Early Action candidates apply by November 1 and receive notification by mid-December . Regular Decision candidates apply by January 1 and receive notification by the end of March .

You may send the application supplements at a later date, preferably no later than 2 weeks after the application deadline. October 31 Restrictive Early Action applicants: We request that you submit your required test scores by the end of October. However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration. November 1 Restrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. Also submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released. Early November If you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT). Mid-December Restrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released. January 1 Your portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. February 1 Notify the Admissions Office ( fileroom@fas.harvard.edu ) if you have not received your application confirmation email. Submit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released. Mid-February Request that your school submit your Midyear School Report forms with your most recent grades. End of March First-year admission decisions released. Early May Reply deadline for admitted students. No deposit required. How and when to submit ACT or SAT scores (for students submitting standardized test scores) You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment. If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed. For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible. You can afford Harvard In just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.* *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Campus & Community Harvard further expands financial aid to ease access March 30, 2023 5 min read College makes regular-admission offers to 1,220, as University changes family-income threshold for second year Harvard College has offered regular admission to 1,220 applicants for the Class of 2027, with 1,942 admitted in total, including those selected in the early action process . The total number of applications for the Class of 2027 was 56,937. “Each year Harvard seeks extraordinarily talented students from across the nation and around the world,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. “The students admitted to the Class of 2027 are remarkable by any measure, and we hope they choose to bring their diverse ideas, beliefs, and experiences to our campus.” Building on its long-standing commitment to increasing opportunity for all talented students regardless of their economic resources, the University is announcing another expansion of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) for low- and middle-income families. Beginning with the class admitted this week, the cost to attend Harvard College, which includes tuition, housing, food, and fees, will be free for families with annual incomes below $85,000. This is an increase from the $75,000 annual income threshold announced last year . Nearly 25 percent of College students come from families with incomes under $85,000. “Harvard is committed to enrolling students of exceptional ability and character from all socioeconomic backgrounds,” said Claudine Gay, Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “This expansion opens Harvard’s doors wider than ever before, and we hope continues to make Harvard an attractive choice for undergraduates who seek to bring their purpose and passion to our community.” Harvard’s undergraduate financial aid program continues to benefit from consistent and aggressive investment. Since launching HFAI in 2005 the University has awarded more than $3 billion in support, and its annual aid budget has risen more than 200 percent, from $80 million to $246 million in 2023. All first-year students from families with incomes of less than $85,000 with typical assets will also receive a $2,000 start-up grant to help with move-in costs and other expenses incurred in the transition to College. This grant was launched in 2016. Based on projections, roughly 55 percent of students will receive need-based grants, allowing aided families to pay an average of $13,000 annually. “The further expansion of our financial aid program underscores our continued, unwavering commitment to making Harvard affordable for all deserving students,” said Jake Kaufmann, Griffin Director of Financial Aid. “We are deeply grateful to the generations of Harvard alumni and friends who have made this possible.” In 2020, Harvard expanded its financial aid program by eliminating the summer work expectation from awards beginning in the 2020–21 academic year and replacing it with scholarship funds. Students are not required to take out loans and are only expected to contribute $3,500 through work during the semesters to meet their estimated personal expenses, including books. In this application cycle, an estimated 19 percent qualified so far for federal Pell grants, typically awarded to students from lower-income backgrounds. Students who will be in the first generation of their families to graduate from a four-year college or the equivalent represent nearly 20 percent of this year’s admitted class. Harvard’s net-price calculator makes it easy for families to get a sense of the College’s affordability. For students not receiving need-based aid, the total cost of attendance (including tuition, housing and food, and fees) is scheduled to increase by 3.5 percent to $79,450 for the 2023–2024 academic year. “The class of 2027 comes from an unusually wide range of backgrounds and life experiences,” said Joy St. John, director of admissions. The members of this year’s admitted class, who learned of the decisions Thursday evening, hail from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 102 countries. International students make up 14.5 percent of the class, and 8.3 percent are U.S. dual citizens. About 22.2 percent come from the mid-Atlantic states, 17.4 percent from the South, 15.9 percent from New England, 17 percent Western and Mountain states, 10.1 percent from the Midwest, and 0.3 percent from U.S. territories. The Class of 2027 reflects the increasing diversity of the College’s applicants, with 15.3 percent identifying as African American/Black, 29.9 percent as Asian American, 11.3 percent as Latinx, 2.2 percent as Native American, and 0.5 percent as Native Hawaiian. Women account for 53.6 percent of all those accepted. As the pandemic continues to disrupt high school students’ access to standardized testing, Harvard announced in January 2022 an extension of its test-optional policy, allowing applicants through the Harvard Class of 2030 to apply without submitting SAT or ACT scores. Harvard has continued efforts to recruit U.S. military veterans, working with groups affiliated with the Defense Department and joining the Service to School’s VetLink program in 2017. Twenty-three veterans were admitted to this year’s class, and 43 students have expressed interest in ROTC. Harvard plans to welcome students to campus for an in-person Visitas, held from April 23-24. The College will host a number of events to welcome the admitted Class of 2027 and introduce them to the community, as well as to available resources and opportunities. Harvard will also continue to host virtual events for students via Crimson Connect, its online platform for the Class of 2027, which will be used throughout the spring to engage with current students, faculty, and staff. Students will receive information about Visitas and Crimson Connect via the Admitted Student Website. In-person Visitas programming will be contingent upon University, local, and state public health guidance. Admitted students will be notified directly of any programming changes. Staff members of the Griffin Financial Aid office will be available to speak with students and their families this month to help them as they make their final college choices. Students have until the end of the day on Monday, May 1, to reply to their offers of admission.

U.S. Military veterans may be particularly interested in our transfer program if they've completed at least one full academic year, and not more than two, of college coursework. Transfer FAQs Do transfer students qualify for financial aid? Yes. All transfer applicants, including international students, are eligible to apply for need-based financial aid. Transfer applicants should follow the prospective student financial aid application instructions. How are transfer students supported on campus? Enrolling students take part in a fall orientation program and are connected with a dedicated transfer adviser who helps with academic planning and the transition to Harvard life. Transfer students who live on-campus will find strong community in their undergraduate Houses, and students who live off campus will benefit from the Dudley Community. Transfer students are also supported by peer advisers , who were themselves transfer students from prior years. What courses transfer to Harvard College? Is there a list of transferrable courses? The Harvard College Registrar's Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. The admissions office does not keep a list of transferrable courses and cannot advise on this matter during the application process. Harvard College typically accepts courses taken while enrolled as a full-time student in an undergraduate program similar to our liberal arts curriculum. The Committee also looks for strong preparation in the student's expected field of specialization. Can I concentrate in business, journalism, law, or medicine? While you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students. I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me? The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here . About Our Transfer Program Each fall, we welcome a very small number (12 on average) of transfer students to Harvard College. We seek students whose previous academic experience will prepare them to flourish in our rigorous and rewarding liberal arts program. In our candidates for transfer admission, we look for: A clearly defined academic need to transfer A proven record of achievement at your current institution Strong faculty recommendations Recently, we have received more than 1,500 transfer applications per year. In pools of this size, the number of well-qualified applicants far exceeded the number of students admitted and enrolled each year as transfer students. As admission to transfer to Harvard is competitive, we encourage you to explore a variety of colleges in your transfer search. Eligibility To be eligible to transfer, you must have completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, and not more than two academic years, by the time you would be enrolling at Harvard . You must complete at least two full years of study at Harvard. Once a student has completed more than two years total of college at another institution, regardless of courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission. Students are eligible to transfer only from a liberal arts curriculum that is similar to Harvard’s. Candidates whose education has been in a vocational, professional, technical, online, extension, or performance program will not ordinarily qualify for transfer admission. Students who have completed one full-time year of college in a regular degree program in lieu of their senior year of high school (often referred to as dual enrollment) should apply for first-year admission if these courses are taken for credit towards a high school diploma. Students who are enrolled part-time are not eligible unless they have previously completed one full-time, continuous academic year. If you are too advanced in your studies to qualify for transfer, you may be interested in the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. No student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the 12 Harvard University graduate schools . The Harvard College Admissions Office is independent of these schools and their admissions policies. Take a Virtual Tour Use our Virtual Tour to discover spaces that aren't even available on an in-person campus tour, such as classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and more. Explore Harvard What We Look For Through our admissions process, we strive to give you ample opportunities to best demonstrate your interests and accomplishments. We welcome candidates who have gone directly from high school into college as well as those who have followed less traditional paths. The Admissions Committee looks for achievement in a rigorous program of study, especially in your expected field of specialization. Beyond strong grades, test scores, and recommendations, the Committee considers other non-academic factors such as significant extracurricular engagements and talents. We also consider an applicant’s personal qualities such as a capacity for leadership, creativity, resiliency, intellectual curiosity, and independent thinking. In addition to our standard application materials, you may submit supplementary materials showcasing exceptional or unusual talents, including musical performance, artistic work, and research material. Learn more about what we look for Timeline Harvard accepts transfer students for fall semester entrance only; we do not admit students for the spring semester. The transfer application becomes available during the fall of the academic year. March 1 : Deadline for all transfer application and financial aid materials. The Transfer Admissions Committee begins to review applications after the application deadline. We will notify applicants of admissions decisions in June. Submitting your materials early does not increase your chances of admission, but it does provide more opportunities to track down any missing documents and ensure that your application is full and complete by the time we begin our review. Please note that college transcripts should be sent between January and March in order to reflect your most updated academic credentials.

Transferring Course Credit Harvard will honor comparable coursework you have done prior to your transfer admission, while also giving you time to take advantage of Harvard’s course offerings and delve deeply into your concentration. You will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 16 semester-long courses—the equivalent of two full years of academic work—providing you the opportunity to take the remaining half of the courses required for your A.B. or S.B. degree at Harvard. The Harvard College Registrar’s Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. While Harvard does not audit transcripts prior to application to determine eligibility, the descriptions below should be helpful in determining which of your courses may transfer. Our office is unable to make recommendations in regards to coursework at your current institution or advise on anticipated class standing during the application process. Which courses are eligible for credit? You may receive credit for courses taken in a full-time, daytime program of study at an accredited degree-granting institution, provided that you: Took courses comparable to those offered in Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum. Earned grades of “C” (or the equivalent) or better Which courses are not eligible for credit? Unfortunately, we are unable to grant credit for certain accomplishments. Harvard does not typically award credit for: Online or distance education courses Night or extension courses Courses taken on a part-time basis Technical or vocational courses such as accounting, marketing, journalism, law, agriculture, nursing, business, communications or specialized military training coursework Dual-enrollment courses counted for credit toward a high school diploma Work done prior to admission in an isolated term, semester or quarter at another college, unless the college from which you are transferring has granted credit for that work Credit gained by accelerating in an academic year at another college College Level Placement Exam (CLEP), Advanced Placement Exam (AP/IB) results, or any credit earned by examination, even when credited to your degree by the college or university from which you wish to transfer Summer school courses, except for those at your current college/university or courses at Harvard Summer School Contacting Transfer Admissions The Transfer Admissions team will be available to answer questions by email at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu Monday through Friday between the hours of 9am and 5pm ET.

African and African American Studies B.A. Social Sciences The Department of African and African American Studies brings together scholars and scholarship from many disciplines to explore the histories, societies, and cultures of African and African-descended people. The field of African and African American Studies is not only interdisciplinary but also comparative and cross-cultural. Visit the African and African American Studies Page Anthropology B.A. Social Sciences Anthropology is the study of human diversity in the distant past and the present and teaches us to recognize the remarkable array of circumstances in which human beings live their lives and make meaning from them. Visit the Anthropology Page Applied Math B.A. Sciences, Social Sciences Applied mathematics represents a quantitative liberal arts degree. The degree provides the opportunity for combining mathematical thinking with any subject for which mathematics can be productively applied. In  some instances, combining applied mathematics with a particular subject can lead to a program of study that is quite similar to studying that subject itself. For example, applied mathematics with physics as an application area is quite similar to studying physics. On the other hand, there are other instances (combining applied mathematics with psychology or government) where the degree program would be quite different. Visit the Applied Math Page Art, Film, and Visual Studies B.A. Arts and Humanities The concentration in Art, Film, and Visual Studies enables students to develop skills in the practice and the critical study of the visual arts. It includes photography, filmmaking, animation, video art, painting, drawing, printmaking, and sculpture, film and visual studies, critical theory, and the study of the built environment. The department has a strong commitment to fostering dialogue among makers, critics, and theorists. Visit the Art, Film, and Visual Studies Page Astrophysics B.A. Sciences The science of astrophysics involves the study of matter and radiation in the universe as understood through the laws of physics. Astronomical phenomena exhibit an extreme range of physical conditions, from superfluid neutrons in neutron stars, high-temperature nuclear reactions in supernovae, and strong gravitational fields near black holes, to the unique state of the universe during its earliest phases. Theoretical attempts to describe these and more familiar phenomena (such as stars and galaxies) have achieved a useful understanding in many cases. However, our overall knowledge of the universe is still woefully incomplete, and our contemporary physical knowledge is often stretched to its limits in attempting to understand physical conditions that cannot be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. Visit the Astrophysics Page Biomedical Engineering B.A. Engineering & Applied Sciences, Sciences Biomedical Engineering lies at the intersection of the physical and life sciences, incorporating principles from physics and chemistry to understand the operation of living systems. As in other engineering fields, the approach is highly quantitative: mathematical analysis and modeling are used to capture the function of systems from subcellular to organism scales. An education in Biomedical Engineering, and engineering more broadly, enables students to translate abstract hypothesis and scientific knowledge into working systems (e.g., prosthetic devices, imaging systems, and biopharmaceuticals). This enables one to both test the understanding of basic principles and to further this knowledge, and it places this understanding in the broader context of societal needs. Visit the Biomedical Engineering Page Chemical and Physical Biology B.A. Sciences Chemical and Physical Biology provides a link between classical approaches to studying biology and the chemical tools and physical methods required to understand dynamic changes in complex biological systems. Visit the Chemical and Physical Biology Page Chemistry B.A. Sciences Chemistry is the science of the structure, properties, and reactions of matter. It is both a basic science, fundamental to an understanding of the world we live in, and a practical science with an enormous number and variety of important applications. Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an understanding of biology and biochemistry and of certain aspects of geology, astronomy, physics, and engineering. Visit the Chemistry Page Chemistry and Physics B.A. Sciences There is exciting science on the somewhat arbitrary and fluid boundary between chemistry and physics. Chemists and physicists often study the same phenomena in slightly different ways, and it is very useful, in the boundary area, to have training in both fields. Recognizing this, the physics department has for many years offered the concentration in Chemistry and Physics. Visit the Chemistry and Physics Page Classics B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences The study of the Classics is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving critical engagement with the literature, art, material culture, and history of the Greco-Roman world. A concentration in the Classics equips students with all the tools necessary for understanding the forms of expression and ways of life of the cultures of antiquity, and for understanding the development of those cultures over time. Concentrators learn skills that are broadly applicable to the analysis of any complex cultural system or artifact. They also acquire fluency in a tradition of art, literature, and philosophy that has been vitally relevant in many periods and contexts, and that remains highly influential today. Visit the Classics Page Comparative Literature B.A. Arts and Humanities Comparative literature is the department for students who want to cross boundaries -- between languages, between cultures, between disciplines. We welcome students who are interested in studying literature in more than one national and linguistic tradition, students who want to explore literature in relation to other arts and media (e.g., film, music, visual art) or disciplines (e.g., philosophy, government, WGS, religion), and students who seek to formulate an individualized program of study within the arts and humanities. Visit the Comparative Literature Page Comparative Study of Religion B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences The concentration in the Comparative Study of Religion invites students to explore the most consequential and momentous questions relevant to the understanding of individual and communal human life.  Concentrators consider topics such as the significance of ritual and practice; differing conceptions of human nature and the nature of the divine; and comparative study of how people understand the meaning of life, suffering, and death.  Our program is unique in allowing students to take up these and other “big” questions in rigorous and critical ways. Visit the Comparative Study of Religion Page Computer Science B.A. Sciences Computer science is about tools and technology, and also about understanding and engaging with the world. From swarms of insects to elementary particles, rational agents in a market, and neurons in a brain, the computational viewpoint has proven a fruitful way to understand natural, social, and engineered systems. Correspondingly, the Computer Science concentration has strong ties not just to engineering, but also economics, law, biology, physics, statistics, mathematics, linguistics, and more. Because information technology affects every aspect of society, graduates with computer science degrees have access to a large variety of careers, including engineering, teaching, medicine, law, basic science, finance, and management. Visit the Computer Science Page Earth and Planetary Sciences B.A. Sciences The Earth and Planetary Sciences department is focused on critical events that have shaped the Earth’s evolution and its place in the solar system. Our approach is to apply interdisciplinary tools to investigate processes from tectonic plate to microbial scale, and across the full sweep of geological time, from the early Earth to the modern world. Using a combination of theoretical, computational, laboratory, and field-based methods, we study natural experiments in Earth's history, and ultimately test the limits of the Earth’s resilience in the geological past and in our progressively warming world. Visit the Earth and Planetary Sciences Page East Asian Studies B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences The concentration in East Asian Studies seeks to develop a critical understanding of the human experience in East Asia. To study East Asia is to be exposed to a world with different forms of political activity and social relations, religious traditions of great depth and philosophical schools with enduring insights, and literatures of unusual range and power. It is also to study a world that since the 19th century has come to share in the dilemmas of modernity that we all confront. Visit the East Asian Studies Page Economics B.A. Social Sciences Economics is a social science that covers broad subject matter in seeking to understand the social world. An economic analysis begins from the premise that individuals have goals and that they pursue those goals as best they can. Economics studies the behavior of social systems—such as markets, corporations, legislatures, and families—as the outcome of interactions through institutions between goal-directed individuals. Ultimately, economists make recommendations that they believe will make people better off. Visit the Economics Page Electrical Engineering B.A. B.S. Engineering & Applied Sciences Electrical Engineering provides the information and communications pathways that link us together, the techniques that allow us to send a multitude of complex information over long distances ever more rapidly, and that allow us to carry out demanding computation on massive amounts of data in ever shorter periods of time. Electrical engineers utilize basic materials properties to craft new devices and systems that will be able to rapidly receive, transmit and store information with ever greater accuracy and efficiency. Visit the Electrical Engineering Page Engineering Sciences B.A. B.S. Engineering & Applied Sciences Engineering plays a critical role in enhancing social progress and improving our quality of life. The Engineering Sciences program educates future leaders with the technical background necessary to develop and critically evaluate the next wave of engineering innovations, to apply these innovations to important local and global problems, and to make informed decisions about them in a societal context. Visit the Engineering Sciences Page English B.A. Arts and Humanities Humans use stories to cope and thrive, from oral poetic traditions to novels, screenplays, and hip hop rhymes. The English Department hones your expertise as a maker and interpreter of stories. By studying English literature, you will learn how to analyze and appreciate the language of the past and to craft new narratives for the future. You will develop expertise in communicating meaningfully through language and in interpreting others’ rhetoric, skills more crucial than ever in our text-saturated world. Along the way, you will both devise and encounter dazzling imaginary worlds that bring readers and writers together across vast expanses of space and time. We commit ourselves to helping students immerse themselves in the literary worlds they know and love, discover new worlds they might not think to explore, acquire the means to write and read according to their own developing tastes, and sustain themselves on their intellectual and creative journeys. Visit the English Page Environmental Science and Engineering B.A. Engineering & Applied Sciences Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) is an interdisciplinary program with the goal of understanding, predicting, and responding to natural and human-induced environmental change. Addressing environmental issues such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, or local and regional air and water pollution requires perspectives from a diverse set of scientific disciplines including atmospheric physics and chemistry, oceanography, glaciology, hydrology, geophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry. This program is structured around the view that the environmental system is comprised of a complex set of chemical, physical, and biological interactions, made even more complicated by the various activities of human society. Through exploration of the underlying processes and feedbacks within the Earth system, and with a range of approaches from theory and modeling to experiments and observations, students are trained to think about environmental processes in an integrated fashion, preparing them to manage the environmental challenges we face. Visit the Environmental Science and Engineering Page Environmental Science and Public Policy B.A. Sciences, Social Sciences The concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy (ESPP) is designed to provide a multidisciplinary introduction to current problems of the environment. It is founded on the premise that the ability to form rational judgments concerning many of the complex challenges confronting society today involving the environment requires both an understanding of the underlying scientific and technical issues and an appreciation for the relevant economic, political, legal, historical, and ethical dimensions. Depending on preparation, students may be encouraged to substitute more advanced courses for these requirements. In consultation with their concentration advisor, Through their field of specialization, students develop expertise in a particular field of study relating to the environment. Visit the Environmental Science and Public Policy Page Folklore and Mythology B.A. Arts and Humanities Folklore and Mythology is a liberal education in and of itself. The program encourages the study of any given community through its language and culture, offering an array of choices for drawing on a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. To focus on the folklore and mythology of a community (at local, regional, national, or even trans-national levels) is to understand how that group or society defines itself through stories, music, food, folktales, legends, dramas, dance, rituals, beliefs, proverbs, epics, myths, customs, law codes, festival celebrations, “wisdom literature,” and many other forms of expressive culture and artistic communication. To study the folklore and mythology of any group is to discover how that group identifies itself in relation to others. Visit the Folklore and Mythology Page Germanic Languages and Literature B.A. Arts and Humanities Our program invites you to explore the languages, literatures, societies and cultures of the German-speaking and Scandinavian regions of Europe: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein; and Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. We offer language courses in German and Swedish as well as tutorials in Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Old Norse, all of which provide a gateway to an exciting exploration of the tremendous impact these cultures have had on the development of Western civilization – from the Vikings to the present day. Visit the Germanic Languages and Literature Page Government B.A. Social Sciences The Department of Government—like political science—is an umbrella for a remarkable range of political subjects and approaches to studying them. It stands at the cross-roads of history, law, economics, sociology, philosophy, and ethics, borrowing from these disciplines as well as constructing theories and methods of its own. Visit the Government Page History B.A. Social Sciences History is a broad discipline encompassing every dimension of human interaction in the past, including social life, the economy, culture, thought, and politics. Students of history study individuals, groups, communities, and nations from every imaginable perspective—employing all the techniques of the humanities and social sciences to raise questions and probe for answers. Students explore the origins and developments that have shaped our contemporary world; and take courses that span the globe and range in chronological scope from antiquity to today. Visit the History Page History and Literature B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences Harvard’s oldest concentration, History & Literature is an interdisciplinary humanities program where you work closely with outstanding faculty in small-group and one-on-one tutorials. Beyond these tutorials, you take courses from a variety of departments as you develop your individual interests at the intersection of art, history, politics, and culture. Visit the History and Literature Page History and Science B.A. Social Sciences History & Science is an interdisciplinary field of study. The program offers students a variety of opportunities to expand their understanding of the scientific enterprise and to explore in detail how science has developed in history and how science has shaped other human activities. Students are challenged to ask big questions about science, medicine, and technology, and their place in human societies across time. How do scientists come to know things about the natural world? Why should we believe what they tell us? What are some social, ethical, political and religious implications of science? How do they affect the way people in different times and places live their lives? Visit the History and Science Page History of Art and Architecture B.A. Social Sciences The History of Art & Architecture concentration offers training in the historical interpretation and critical analysis of the visual arts and architecture. It develops the skills of visual discrimination and verbal expression fundamental to art historical analysis. Art history is a multifaceted discipline embracing many different methods, perspectives and interests. Training in the critical analysis of art seeks to clarify the perception – and understanding – of how artworks relate to the techniques and materials used in their making, and to the environment in which they are seen. It also fosters the ability to make and explain judgments of quality and value. Visit the History of Art and Architecture Page Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology B.A. Sciences Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) is a life science concentration that educates students on how human beings develop from a fertilized egg, are maintained and repaired throughout adulthood, and age till life’s end. Students will be given a broad education in modern life sciences by studying important biological principles within the specific rubric of the developing and regenerating body. By adding an explicit and heavy emphasis on hands-on research opportunities in all four undergraduate years, HDRB will engage students with an interest in research and take advantage of Harvard’s special strengths as a teaching college and research university. Visit the Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology Page Human Evolutionary Biology B.A. Sciences Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB) explores all aspects of human biology and behavior from an evolutionary perspective. HEB thus provides students with the knowledge and skills they need to investigate and answer questions about how and why humans are the way we are, and why that matters for real world problems. Research in human evolutionary biology has implications for medical science, exercise physiology and diet as well as for economics, psychology, political science, religion and literature. Visit the Human Evolutionary Biology Page Integrative Biology B.A. Sciences Evolution is the strand that ties together all of biology: from the adaptive specifics of a membrane pore to grand events in the history of life, such as the Cambrian Explosion, when, 540 million years ago, life went in a single bound from simple to complex. Adaptive evolution is a response to the demands of the environment, whether this is the environment within a cell or an ecological community of interacting organisms. Integrative Biology (IB) therefore is inherently inter-disciplinary, encompassing mathematical and computational biology, functional and genetic approaches to morphology and development, as well as genetics, evolution, and ecology. Visit the Integrative Biology Page Linguistics B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences Linguists are engaged in the study of language structure, which is the ultimate interdisciplinary enterprise. Linguistic theory attempts to model a complex domain of human knowledge that is also central to philosophy of mind and to cognitive psychology. The linguistic models that theoretical linguists construct are formal in character and rely on computational and mathematical methodologies. As such, linguistics has a mutually beneficial relationship with computer science and the study of artificial intelligence. Visit the Linguistics Page Mathematics B.A. Sciences Mathematics is the science of order, and mathematicians seek to identify instances of order and to find notions and tools to perceive order where it is a priori hidden from view. Perhaps the most important concept of mathematics is that of function, which provides us with the means to study dependence and change. The study of real functions of a real variable (and later complex functions), particularly in connection with the limit concept, is called analysis. The most effective tool for this study is the infinitesimal calculus that analyzes the relation between functions and their derivatives. Then there are the notions and tools for the study of number systems and their generalizations; these form the branch of mathematics called algebra. Here the primary concepts are group, ring, field, and module. A third over-arching set of notions and tools concerns geometry, which now goes far beyond the classical study of the space we live in to include spaces of high dimension and topology, the abstract theory of shape. Visit the Mathematics Page Mechanical Engineering B.S. Engineering & Applied Sciences Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that uses the principles of physics and materials science for the analysis and design of mechanical and thermal systems. Mechanical engineering is critical to the success of many human enterprises - it plays a central role in the generation and distribution of energy, transportation, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. Nearly every product or service in modern life has been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer. Visit the Mechanical Engineering Page Molecular and Cellular Biology B.A. Sciences Molecular and Cellular Biology is rooted in the investigation of biological processes based on the study of molecules and their interactions in the context of cells and tissues, and how the genome orchestrates cell behavior. Visit the Molecular and Cellular Biology Page Music B.A. Arts and Humanities The concentration in Music exposes students to a wide variety of musical styles, sounds, and musical traditions in order to develop their critical understanding of music in diverse cultural and historical contexts. The concentration also provides a solid foundation in theory, analysis, composition, and criticism, while developing critical listening skills, which are a pivotal contribution that engagement with music makes to the humanities. Although the Department of Music is not in itself a school of music with a performance department, all of our courses support the intellectual development of musicians, and several of our courses incorporate or focus on performance. Visit the Music Page Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations introduces students to the ancient and modern peoples, languages, cultures, and societies of the Near/Middle East. Loosely defined as stretching from Morocco in the west to Iran and Afghanistan in the east, the region is home some of the world’s great religions and civilizations. Historically, the influence of its languages, literatures and cultures has extended to Central, East and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America. Thus, the study of the Near and Middle East is an important area of academic inquiry on account of its political, economic and cultural significance on the international stage. Visit the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Page Neuroscience B.A. Sciences Neuroscientists explore what is arguably the least understood and most important area of biology: how billions of electrically charged neurons create our rich sensory, emotional, and intellectual life (and no less than all animal behavior!). Neuroscience as a field is interdisciplinary and encompasses many areas of science, including genetics, chemistry, molecular biology, mathematics, cell and systems biology, computer science, and cognitive science. Neuroscientists study every aspect of the brain - from genes to behavior. As such, when you become a neuroscience student you will get broad training as a biologist as well as a new perspective on what it means to be a human. Visit the Neuroscience Page Philosophy B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences Philosophy studies many of humanity’s fundamental questions: how should we live, what kind of society should we strive towards, what are the limits of human knowledge? What is truth? Justice? Beauty? These questions are central to our lives, because in much of what we do, we at least implicitly assume answers to them. Philosophy seeks to reflect on these questions and answer them in a systematic, explicit, and rigorous way—relying on careful argumentation, and drawing from outside fields as diverse as economics, literature, religion, law, mathematics, the physical sciences, and psychology. And while most of the tradition of philosophy is Western, we seek to connect with non-Western traditions like Islam and Buddhism, as well. Visit the Philosophy Page Physics B.A. Sciences The concentration in Physics serves a variety of goals and interests. Many concentrators seek an understanding of the subtle, profound, and fundamental laws—relativity, quantum mechanics, and the basic force laws—that govern the behavior of all matter. Often these studies involve the smallest units of matter: molecules, atoms, nuclei, and sub-nuclear particles. A major interest of other Physics concentrators is the exploration and explanation of the diverse properties to which these laws give rise in macroscopic systems such as fluids and solids. Still others study aspects of more complex systems like oceans and atmospheres, stars, and living matter. Visit the Physics Page Psychology B.A. Sciences, Social Sciences Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, and as such, we investigate the minds of humans and other species. We try to understand the mind at many different levels of analysis, from taking measurements from the brain, through learning about the individual, all the way to understanding groups and organizations. Most of the research conducted in Harvard’s Department of Psychology concerns basic psychological processes such as attention, perception, memory, categorization, reasoning, decision-making, language, cognitive and social development, social cognition, intergroup relations, and morality. In addition, some members of the department conduct research on the etiology, development, and treatment of psychopathology. All members of the department share the common goal of understanding mind, brain, and behavior through empirical investigation, and their teaching and research reflect this goal. Visit the Psychology Page Romance Languages and Literature B.A. Arts and Humanities In the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures (RLL), undergraduates discover the literatures, cultures, and critical approaches of societies worldwide where French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan are spoken. RLL offers language courses from the beginning to advanced levels, as well as opportunities for accelerated work and study abroad.  The heart of the concentration consists of courses about literature and society taught in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.  Faculty also offer advanced courses in English on special topics that involve more than one language tradition. Visit the Romance Languages and Literature Page Slavic Literatures and Cultures B.A. Arts and Humanities The concentration in Slavic Literatures and Cultures offers you the opportunity to study the great works and cultural traditions, past and present, of Russia and the other Slavic countries, especially Ukraine, Poland, and the Czech Republic. These countries share a rich cultural life as well as a turbulent and fascinating history. In the Slavic concentration, you will develop proficiency in Russian or another Slavic language such as Czech, Polish, or Ukrainian; you will learn to read literary works in the original language, gain valuable experience for working and traveling abroad, and come to understand these cultures and the important role they have played in the modern world Visit the Slavic Literatures and Cultures Page Social Studies B.A. Social Sciences Social Studies was founded in 1960 by a distinguished group of faculty who believed that the study of the social world requires an integration of the disciplines of history, political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology. For over five decades, Social Studies has brought together outstanding teachers and intellectually engaged students who share a fascination with social science research and theory and a deep interest in applying social science to contemporary social, economic, and political problems. Visit the Social Studies Page Sociology B.A. Social Sciences Sociology is the study of society, of the social frameworks within which we live our lives. It is a study of social life at every level, from two-person relationships to the rise and fall of nations and civilizations. Visit the Sociology Page South Asian Studies B.A. Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences A concentration in South Asian Studies enables students to develop a critical understanding of the diverse cultures, histories, languages and literatures of South Asia, which includes Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet. South Asia is home to more than a billion people and some of the world’s most fascinating and important civilizations. Its influence has extended historically from Central, East, and Southeast Asia to Europe and North America, which today have vibrant South Asian diasporas. The study of South Asia is an increasingly important area of academic inquiry, especially in recent decades as the region emerges as a global cultural, economic, and political power. Visit the South Asian Studies Page Statistics B.A. Sciences, Social Sciences Statistics is a relatively young discipline, organized around the rapidly growing body of knowledge about principled methods for data collection and data analysis, the making of rational decisions under uncertainty, and the modeling of randomness in any quantitative inquiries, including the social, natural, and medical sciences. Statistics has a theoretical core surrounded by a large number of domains of application in fields such as anthropology, astronomy, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, education, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, finance, forensic science, geophysical sciences, government, history, law, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, physics, population science, psychology, sociology, and many others. Visit the Statistics Page Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality B.A. Social Sciences The concentration in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality (WGS) brings together a wide range of academic fields in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences (including history, literature, visual studies, anthropology, sociology, ethnic studies, political science, psychology, and biology, to name just a few). As an interdisciplinary field of study, WGS pays close attention to how social norms have changed over time and how they vary across cultures. The concentration also actively investigates the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality have shaped public policy, civil rights, health care, religion, education and the law, as well as the depiction of women and men in art, literature, and the popular media. WGS courses are characterized by a strong commitment to critical thinking, as well as a spirit of open and sustained intellectual inquiry. Visit the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Page Theater, Dance & Media B.A. Arts and Humanities Theater, Dance & Media (TDM) combines historical and theoretical study of live and digital arts with the practice of those arts. Taught by FAS Faculty, and by practitioners from the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Dance Center, as well as numerous visiting artists/scholars each year, students are introduced to the rigor and discipline required to participate in professional theater, dance and media practices. TDM emphasizes collaboration. The concentration explores the many ways to act, design, direct, compose, choreograph, dance, write, produce and organize live art and digital media. Our studio courses model and study the many forms of art collaboration; similarly, scholarly courses look to the history and theory of culture as a complement to the skills gained in studio practice.

This marks the fourth consecutive year Harvard has received more than 50,000 applications. Students accepted during the regular admissions cycle number 1,245. Last December, the College offered admissions to 692 students who applied under the Early Action Program . “Beyond another strong applicant pool, we are delighted by the stunning array of talents and lived experiences the Class of 2028 will bring with them from throughout the United States and around the world,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. By the numbers Nearly 1 in 4 Undergraduates come from a family whose annual income is $85,000 or less $2,000 “Start-up grants” for first-year students and “launch grants” for juniors are given to students whose family incomes are $85,000 or less $3 billion+ In undergraduate financial aid has been awarded since launching the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative 55% Of Harvard undergraduates receive financial aid $13,000 Average parent contribution for aided students Nearly 85% Of the Class of 2023 graduated debt-free Members of the Class of 2028, who learned of the decisions Thursday evening, hail from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 94 countries. They are 53.1 percent women and 46.9 percent men. Students who will be in the first generation of their family to graduate from a four-year college or the equivalent represent 20.5 percent of the class. In this application cycle, 20.7 percent qualified for federal Pell grants, typically awarded to students from lower-income backgrounds. International students make up 15.4 percent of the class, and 9.6 percent are U.S. dual citizens. An estimated 20.1 percent come from the mid-Atlantic states, 16.2 percent from the South, 16.6 percent from New England, 18.5 percent from Western and Mountain states, 11.4 percent from the Midwest, and 0.4 percent from U.S. territories. Harvard continues efforts to recruit U.S. military veterans, working with groups affiliated with the Defense Department and through Service to School’s Vetlink program. Twenty-one veterans were admitted to the Class of 2028, and 41 students have expressed interest in ROTC. Members of the admitted class will benefit from the recent expansion of the financial aid program. Last spring , the Griffin Financial Aid Office announced that students whose family income is $85,000 or less will receive full financial support to attend Harvard. It also announced last fall a new launch grant giving students who receive full financial support $2,000 in the fall of their junior year to help with costs associated with preparing for life after graduation. Since 2016, students receiving full financial aid have been eligible for similar startup grants to help them adjust to life on campus. “We are always thinking about impact, and the new launch grant gives students extra resources — for graduate school test prep, or travel to a job interview — as they begin planning for their next chapters. This support — in combination with the work of the Mignone Center for Career Success — allows us to help the students who need it most,” said Jake Kaufmann, Griffin Director of Financial Aid. The work to expand opportunities for students accessing financial aid includes the 2020 decision to remove the summer work expectation. Nearly one-quarter of students attend Harvard with no parent contribution. In the 2023-2024 academic year, the average parent contribution for aided students was $13,000. For students who do not receive need-based aid, the total cost of attendance (including tuition, housing and food, and fees) is scheduled to increase 4.3 percent to $82,866 for the 2024-2025 academic year. This application cycle benefited from a robust recruitment effort that included students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Admissions officers traveled to 150 cities in the U.S. and around the world to conduct in-person information sessions while more than 7,000 alums helped interview applicants and recruit students through college fairs and other events. “We often focus on the end results in admissions, but it is also important to acknowledge the tremendous work that goes into getting us here,” said Director of Admissions Joy St. John. “We could not build this talented and diverse pool of applicants without this support.” Harvard welcomes admitted students to campus for Visitas programming April 14-15. At that time, the Class of 2028 is invited to attend classes and events as well as learn about resources and opportunities. Students will receive information about Visitas and Crimson Connect, an online platform for the Class of 2028, via the Admitted Student Website . Students have until May 1 to reply to their offers of admission.

Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer Campus & Community College accepts 692 under Early Action Program December 14, 2023 4 min read Class of 2028 invited to attend Visitas on April 14-15 Harvard College on Thursday accepted 692 students to the Class of 2028 from a pool of 7,921 who applied under the Early Action Program. “It’s exciting to see that so many of the nation’s and the world’s most promising students have been admitted early to the Class of 2028.  Their extraordinary range of talent and many contributions to their communities will add immeasurably to Harvard over the next four years and beyond,” said Admissions and Financial Aid Dean William R. Fitzsimmons. Students deferred in Early Action will be considered again in the regular decision cycle. That deadline is Jan. 1, and those applicants will receive decisions in late March. This year’s Early Action pool marks a return to numbers consistent with pre-pandemic sizes. Today’s acceptances come after the Griffin Financial Aid Office’s recent expansion of its robust support of students. The establishment of a new launch grant gives students receiving full financial support – those whose annual family income is $85,000 or less — $2,000 in the fall of their junior year to help with the costs associated with getting ready for post-Harvard life. Since 2016, incoming students on full support have been eligible for similar start-up grants to help smooth their transition to campus. “Our terrific financial aid program, especially with the new launch grant, is able to provide even more support to students who need it most. Financial support combined with resources like those provided through the Mignone Center for Career Success make it possible for all students to follow their goals during and after Harvard,” said Jake Kaufmann, Griffin Director of Financial Aid. Of the Class of 2028’s accepted Early Action cohort, 15.5 percent come from first-generation college backgrounds, compared with about 14 percent last year. Additionally, 20.8 percent had their application fees waived due to financial need compared with 19.7 percent last year. This year, Harvard joined STORY (Small Town Outreach, Recruitment, and Yield), a new consortium of 30 public and private universities working to raise the awareness in rural communities about opportunities at Harvard and similar institutions.  The STORY consortium traveled to five locations in the South and Midwest this fall to speak with students, families, and high school college counselors about the admissions process and financial aid. Students from rural communities and small towns make up 10 percent of accepted students to date. Among accepted students so far, 22.3 percent are from New England, 20.8 percent are from the mid-Atlantic, 14.5 percent are from the South, 8.4 percent are from the Midwest, 17.2 percent are from the West, and nearly 17 percent are from outside the United States. Applicants for the Class of 2028 were the first to experience Harvard’s reorganized application supplement.  Harvard removed the single optional essay in which students could select from 10 suggested topics, and replaced it with required short answer questions, all of which were previously optional short answers or suggested supplemental essay topics. Requiring students to respond to each question ensures that the admission committee has consistent information to review across applicants. The questions ask students to reflect on their own experiences, intellectual interests, plans after college, and living with others. “We continue to attract applications from a diverse range of secondary schools and communities around the world. Students have responded well to this year’s essay questions, using them to share their passions and hopes for the future. We look forward to seeing what these students contribute to the community once they are here,” said Director of Admissions Joy St. John. Harvard College continues to allow students to apply without requiring SAT or ACT scores, a change in policy announced three years ago for the admitted classes of 2026-2030. Students were notified of Early Action decisions at 7 p.m. Thursday. Those admitted are not obligated to attend and have until May 1 to make their final decision. The deadline to apply for regular decision is 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Jan. 1. Harvard College will welcome accepted students to campus for Visitas weekend April 14-15. At that time, the Class of 2028 is invited to attend classes and events as well as learn about resources and opportunities.  Students will receive information about Visitas and Crimson Connect via the Admitted Student Website .

Figuring out how to pay for it shouldn't be. Harvard is more affordable than public universities for 90 percent of Americans—and international students receive exactly the same financial aid as American students. Because we want to bring the best people to Harvard regardless of their financial circumstances, we follow two important principles: Need-blind admissions. Your financial need and your aid application will never affect your chance of being admitted to Harvard. 100% need-based aid. We base aid awards on need, not on merit. This means that financial aid supports the students who will benefit from it the most. Furthermore, we meet 100 percent of our students' demonstrated financial need. We will work with you and your family one-on-one to help you navigate the options and make sure Harvard is an affordable option for your education. Revolutionary Financial Aid This preview video does not contain audio. Video description: Lucerito and her parents in their California home Watch \"Revolutionary Financial Aid\" ℹ︎ Video End of embedded content Determining Need Our financial aid officers will work closely with you and your family to determine your demonstrated need and your family’s expected contribution. For many families, this is between zero and 10 percent of family income. Because everyone's circumstances are unique, it's difficult to summarize the many financial aid options and policies that exist. The simplest way to put it is this: We want to make Harvard accessible and affordable for everyone who gets in—no matter what. Use our Net Price Calculator to quickly estimate your aid package and expected family contribution. You can also visit the MyInTuition Quick College Cost Estimator to see just how affordable an education can be at Harvard and other schools. FAQs about determining need Parent Contribution We determine parent contribution through a careful review of your family's income, assets, and overall financial circumstances. For families with annual incomes below $85,000 (increased from $75,000 beginning in the 2023-24 academic year), the expected contribution is zero. Families with annual incomes between $85,000 and $150,000 will contribute between 0 and 10 percent of their income. Those with incomes above $150,000 will be asked to pay proportionately more than 10 percent based on their circumstances. Families who have significant assets will be asked to pay more, but home equity and retirement assets are not considered in our assessment of financial need. Parents may provide their contribution from savings, current income, future income (through borrowing), or a combination of these methods. You can use our net price calculator to estimate your expected family contribution. Student Contribution As the primary beneficiary of a Harvard education, all students are expected to contribute to their college expenses. Your financial aid award will include a standard expected contribution from your own earnings. In the past, students were expected to contribute from both term-time and summer earnings; however, we have recently expanded our financial aid program by eliminating the summer work expectation for all students beginning in the 2020-21 academic year. Students are still expected to contribute a standard amount through term-time work to meet their estimated personal expenses. If you have savings or other assets, you will also be expected to contribute a small portion toward college expenses. This determination will be included with your financial aid award. Most students work to meet their student contribution, and jobs on campus are plentiful and varied. Visit our Guide to Student Employment for more information. Some students use outside awards or loans to replace their expected contribution. If you can't save up enough for your student contribution, the Harvard Loan program may be able to help. Unusual Family Circumstances We know that every family is different. Your financial circumstances are also unique. We are happy to work with you on an individual basis if you have complex, uncommon, or challenging financial circumstances that are not easily described in the standard aid application. We hope families discuss the cost of going to college and agree that paying for education is a priority, but we can't provide extra aid for students whose parents withdraw financial support. Similarly, we can't provide additional aid for families that have incurred large consumer debts. Please know that we will work with you and your family to make Harvard as affordable as possible. Contact the FAO to learn more. Net Price Calculator How affordable is Harvard? Use our Net Price Calculator and see for yourself. Net Price Calculator Cost of Attendance We know that paying for a private college education is a significant undertaking. Our goal is to make sure it remains manageable for you and your family. These values represent the full cost of a Harvard education before taking into account financial aid or scholarships, so the amount that your family will pay will likely be significantly lower. If you are eligible for aid, you may also receive an additional allowance for travel and personal expenses. You can use our Net Price Calculator to gain a better estimate of your personal cost of attendance.

History of Financial Aid Harvard’s long tradition of opportunity and access continues to be strengthened by the partnership and generosity of our amazing alumni and donor community. History of Financial Aid Types of Aid Financial aid is completely need-based and considers many factors, such as your family’s income, assets, size, and unusual expenses. There are no merit-based awards, and we have no preferential policies that give some students more attractive awards than others. When you qualify for financial aid from Harvard, we create an individualized aid package to meet all of your demonstrated need. This may include scholarship funds and student employment, as well as any scholarships you’ve earned from outside sources. Parent and student loans are also available for interested families, although we will never require you to take out loans.

C. International Data Transfers Much of our Personal Data processing takes place in the United States, though sometimes we or third parties with whom we share data may process data in other countries.  The data protection laws in the United States and other countries may provide less protection than such laws in your Relevant Country.  In the event we transfer your Personal Data outside your Relevant Country as part of our In-scope Processing, we rely where required on appropriate or suitable safeguards or specific legal provisions permitting such transfers under the Relevant Law. When transferring Personal Data from a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or from the United Kingdom (UK) to a country outside the EEA and the UK, we may base such transfers on contracts containing legally authorized data protection clauses referred to as Standard Contractual Clauses.  You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses relevant to any such transfer of your Personal Data by contacting us as set forth in the “ Contact Us ” section below.

Everyone About your student record All students have access to their own education records. You may contribute to your student record if you feel there is need for clarification. To be useful, your student record must be accurate and complete. The officials who maintain your student record are in charge of the functions reflected in the records and the offices where the records are kept. In FAS these officials include: FAS Registrar's Office Officers of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard College, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Update your personal information The my.harvard student information system contains directory information for each student such as your: Name Address Phone number Email Emergency contact Missing person contact You can update this information at any time via my.harvard via the Personal Information tab. We highly recommend reviewing your personal information every 3 months. Learn how to update your personal information Access your student record In-person requests: Due to COVID-19, we will not accept in-person student record requests until further notice. If you would like to view your student record ( education records ), complete the appropriate step below based on your school or alumni status. You must indicate which records you would like to view in order for your form to be processed. Harvard College students Complete the Undergraduate Student Record Request form Send your completed form to fileviewing@fas.harvard.edu from your Harvard-issued (@college.harvard.edu) email address Once we receive your request, we will gather the appropriate records and give you access within 45 days of receiving your request GSAS students For access to your GSAS student record, please contact GSAS Student Affairs at studaff@fas.harvard.edu Alumni Complete the Alumni Student Record Request form Send your completed form to fileviewing@fas.harvard.edu from an email address on file with Harvard Alumni Affairs Once we receive your request, we will gather the appropriate records and give you access within 45 days of receiving your request Guidelines for viewing your student record When a record contains information about more than one student, the student requesting access may inspect and review only the portion of the record relating to them. You are not permitted to view letters and statements of recommendation to which you waived your right of access, or that were placed in your file before January 1, 1975. You should direct any questions you have about the accuracy of your education records to the person in charge of the office that maintains the records. If you still have questions, please contact the Associate Registrar for Operations, at registrar@fas.harvard.edu . If you are unable to resolve issues through informal communications, you may need to resolve challenges concerning the accuracy of records during a hearing. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (FERPA) is a federal law that gives students certain rights with respect to their education records. Note: As an institutional policy Harvard FAS does not offer a FERPA waiver form or parental release form for access to student information. Education Records We routinely maintain records that describe and document your work and progress as a student in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Your education records generally include information such as: Permanent and local addresses Admissions records Enrollment status Course grades Reports and evaluations Completion of requirements and progress toward the degree Records of disciplinary actions Letters of recommendation Directory Information Directory information is information that under FERPA can be made available to the general public. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Directory Information All FAS students have the following directory information in their record: Full name Reported date of birth Dates of attendance Concentration Class year Digitized image (please note that while Harvard classifies photos and images as directory information, these are rarely released to parties outside the University without your permission) Local or campus residence address and telephone number University email address Secondary school (for College students) Undergraduate college (for GSAS students) Hometown or city at the time you applied for admission Original class at time of matriculation Degree candidate status Date of graduation (actual or expected) Degree(s) received with field of concentration and level of honors granted (if any) Department of study University prizes, fellowships, and similar honors awarded In certain cases, your and your parents' or guardians' home addresses and telephone numbers Harvard College students may have additional directory information in their record including: House affiliation Height and weight (members of athletic teams only) Student employees, in certain circumstances, may have additional directory information in their record including: Job title Teaching appointment (if applicable) Employing department and dates of employment Harvard University Directory Information Please note that Harvard University's definition of directory information may include additional components and that University-level directory information requests may therefore include additional pieces of information. FERPA blocks You may prevent FAS from disclosing your directory information—this is called a FERPA block. If you would like to enable a FERPA block, you must inform the FAS Registrar's Office, ordinarily in person ( view business hours ). Possible consequences of enabling a FERPA block include: Missed mailings, messages, and announcements Not being able to verify your enrollment or degree status Not being included in the Harvard Commencement program If you have previously chosen to enable a FERPA block, you can reverse your decision by emailing the Registrar's Office at registrar@fas.harvard.edu . Other disclosures permitted under FERPA In addition to permitting the disclosure of directory information , FERPA allows FAS to disclose education records without your knowledge or consent under certain circumstances. For example, disclosure is permitted to Harvard officials with a legitimate educational interest in the records. This means that the person needs your information in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities including: including instructional, supervisory, advisory, administrative, academic or research, staff support or other duties. Harvard officials include: Faculty Administrators Clerical employees Professional employees Harvard University Health Services staff members Harvard University Police Department officers Agents of the University, such as independent contractors or vendors performing functions on behalf of FAS or the University Members of Harvard's governing boards Students serving on an official FAS, College, GSAS or University committee, or assisting other Harvard officials in performing their tasks Your education record also may be shared with parties outside the University under certain conditions, including, for example, in situations involving a health and safety emergency. Additionally, the FAS Registrar's Office will forward your education records to other agencies or institutions that have requested your records and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled so long as the disclosure is for purposes related to your enrollment or a transfer to another institution. If either Harvard College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences finds that you have committed a disciplinary violation involving a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, then FAS also may, if legally permitted and appropriate in the judgment of Harvard College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, disclose certain information about the disciplinary case. The disclosure may include: Your name Violation committed Sanction imposed Student rights under FERPA Under both Harvard policy and FERPA, as a student or former student you may inspect and review certain components of your education records maintained by Harvard. You may: Exercise limited control over other people's access to your education records Seek to correct your education records if you believe them to be inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of your FERPA rights File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education if you believe Harvard has not complied with the requirements of FERPA Be fully informed of your rights under FERPA Complaints regarding alleged violation of rights of students under FERPA may be submitted in writing within 180 days to the Family Policy Compliance Office, US Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920.

Policy Statement Harvard University is committed to making University Information Technology and University Digital Content accessible. For the purposes of this Policy, “accessible” means a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use. Digital Accessibility Standards Toward meeting the University’s commitment to accessibility, Harvard expects University Information Technology and University Digital Content to conform to applicable Digital Accessibility Standards to the fullest extent possible. For the purposes of this Policy, the Digital Accessibility Standards (or “the Standards”) are The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1, Level AA Conformance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) for websites and web-based applications and services. Software and services that are not web-based should conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA to the extent such guidelines may usefully be applied to improve the accessibility of these resources. In the case of digital hardware interfaces, the Standards also include the federal Section 508 standards described in Chapter 4 (“Hardware”) of Appendix C to 36 C.F.R. Part 1194, whether or not such instances of hardware are covered by the regulation. The Path Forward New Instances of University IT Instances of University Information Technology newly purchased, licensed, or internally developed after June 1, 2023 are expected to conform to the Standards to the fullest extent possible at the point of rollout or implementation. Where such conformance with the Standards is not technically feasible or may require extraordinary measures due to the nature or purpose of the Information Technology, a request for exception may be submitted for review by an appropriate University, School, or Unit Authority. New University Content Starting on June 1, 2023, Harvard users using University IT to post, distribute, or publish University Content should aim to make such content conform to the Standards, to the extent technically feasible and in accordance with the University Content framework specified in the Implementation Procedures. Where conformance with the Standards is not technically feasible, Harvard users should consider how to make University Content available in an alternative format accessible (as defined above) to persons with disabilities. Existing University IT and Content As further outlined in the Implementation Procedures, the Accessibility Steering Committee will establish and recommend to Senior Leadership a prioritization plan for improving the accessibility of existing University Information Technology, including websites and web-based applications, and the existing University Content hosted, published, or communicated on those platforms. Priority will be given to University IT platforms that provide the most essential functions to, and are most broadly and regularly used by, Harvard faculty, staff, and students. In the case of public-facing websites, priority will be given to sites that are among the most highly trafficked and to those that contain core institutional information. Procurement Considerations Harvard personnel purchasing or procuring University Information Technology are responsible for ensuring that suppliers seeking to develop or provide University IT are aware of this Policy and that contracts with such vendors hold them accountable to the Standards to the fullest extent possible. Harvard Strategic Procurement, the HUIT Vendor Management Office, and others charged with supporting IT procurement efforts should support these efforts when involved in IT purchases. The Implementation Procedures published under this Policy will identify resources, strategies, and guidelines for securing the greatest possible level of conformance to the Standards from third-party vendors, and purchasers and providers of University IT are expected to adopt and practice them. The Policy expects that the University will apply such market power as it has to prioritize and promote digital accessibility. However, the Policy recognizes that the University is able to exert less control over some “off-the-shelf” Information Technology developed and marketed outside the University. Definitions “University Information Technology” or “University IT” is Information Technology purchased, developed, deployed, or used for University Business and, in the case of web-based applications and websites, is hosted on a Harvard-owned or -controlled domain. “Information Technology” includes software; server-based, personal computer, mobile device, and web-based applications and websites; website hosting and design services; development, hosting, maintenance, and archiving services; cloud-based applications and information processing or storage services; digital hardware interfaces; and digital database configurations and interfaces. “University Content” is Digital Content created, posted, distributed or published for University Business. “Digital Content” consists of any information or communication accessed or displayed in a digital format or medium, as text, image, audio, or video. “University Business” includes activities carried out by Harvard faculty and staff in furtherance of Harvard University’s mission of teaching and research but does not include activities organized or conducted by students or student organizations. “Senior Leadership” includes the University’s President, Provost, Executive Vice President, and Vice Presidents; the Deans of the several Schools, their Department Chairs, and the Directors of University and School Centers or their designees. Responsibility The University expects that Senior Leadership will promote broad awareness of this Policy, assign responsibility to ensure the accessibility of University IT provided within their jurisdictions, and designate Digital Accessibility Liaisons. Improving digital accessibility requires the attention and commitment of the entire University community. Accordingly, all members of the Harvard community should be mindful of this Policy and aim to ensure that University Content they post to, publish on, or communicate through University IT is accessible. Where possible, including on websites operated by the University, Harvard administrators should indicate commitment to accessibility by posting a link to this Policy. Resources and Support The University is committed to providing resources and support to the Harvard community in order to effectuate this Policy. Accessibility Steering Committee The Accessibility Steering Committee is convened by the President and/or Provost. In addition to preparing the prioritization plan described above (see “Existing University IT and Content”), the ASC is responsible for (1) providing periodic review and revision of this Policy and its Implementation Procedures, including making appropriate updates to the Policy’s Standards definition as industry standards and practices evolve, with recommendations going to the President and/or Provost; (2) working with Senior Leadership to promote general awareness of this Policy; (3) assessing and reporting to the President and/or Provost the University’s accessibility efforts as outlined in this Policy; and (4) establishing a process and designating appropriate authorities to review and decide on requests for Policy exceptions. Digital Accessibility Services The Office of Digital Accessibility Services (“DAS”) within Harvard University Information Technology is responsible for supporting Senior Leadership across the University in creating and sustaining a culture of commitment at Harvard. In addition to devising Implementation Procedures for the ASC to review, DAS provides training, guidance, and information on accessibility standards and best practices and works with University IT purchasers and providers, and their technical partners, to advise or augment their efforts toward adopting the Standards. Guided by ASC priorities, DAS tracks and supports remediation efforts throughout Harvard. Digital Accessibility Liaisons Digital Accessibility Liaisons (“DAL”) are appointed by Senior Leadership. DAL coordinate local accessibility efforts and report on progress to the ASC and DAS. University Disability Resources University Disability Resources (UDR) within Central Administration provides leadership to University efforts to ensure an accessible, inclusive, and welcoming learning and working environment for persons with disabilities while complying with federal and state regulations. UDR serves as a University-wide resource on disability-related information, procedures, and services for the Harvard community, digital and otherwise. Exceptions and Remediation As outlined in the Implementation Procedures, IT purchasers or providers requesting an exception to this Policy may be required to submit an accommodation plan detailing how the unit will make, as applicable, the services or information provided by the University IT in question available to persons with disabilities, by alternate accessible (as defined above) means. The additional cost and expense incurred to bring University IT into conformance will not be considered a valid basis for grant of an exception, except in extraordinary circumstances and as approved by the Accessibility Steering Committee (“ASC”). Further details on exceptions processes will be included in the Implementation Procedures document. The ASC may require that some or all non-conforming portions of an instance of University Content (as provided in the University Content framework specified in the Implementing Procedures) or University IT be brought into conformance by designated staff or suppliers, and the expense of that work may be charged to the unit that is responsible for assuring the accessibility of that asset. If the ASC is unable to identify who is responsible for an instance of University Content that does not conform to the framework, then the ASC may ask that HUIT remove the non-conforming content from view until it can be brought into conformance. Upon a specific request by an individual who is unable to access specific University Content due to non-conformance to the Standards, either the requested content must be updated to conform to the Standards or the requested content otherwise must be made available in an alternative format in a timely manner. The unit responsible for the creation and maintenance of University Content is responsible for making it accessible or providing the accessible alternative. Disclaimer This Policy establishes internal guidelines and expectations for the purpose of promoting and advancing digital accessibility at Harvard University. Harvard reserves the right to modify the Policy unilaterally at any time. The Policy is not intended to create, nor does it create, any contractual or other legal obligation on Harvard’s part, or any contractual or other legal right for any member of the Harvard community or the general public. Note: this updated Policy supersedes the previous Digital Accessibility Policy, which was made effective on April 30, 2019 and applied exclusively to “University Websites,” which was defined to include only certain public-facing websites within a Harvard-controlled domain. The updated Policy has a broader scope and applies to all websites within Harvard-controlled domains, as well as the other forms of Information Technology listed in the definition above. --- Last updated: June 1, 2023 Report Report a Web Accessibility Concern ➜ Related Implementation Procedures Frequently Asked Questions Read the Gazette Article Upcoming Policy training 2024 Jun 12 Introduction to Digital Accessibility & Harvard's Policies 10:30am to 12:00pm All Trainings DAS Office Hours Not sure where to start with accessibility?

Dominio del idioma inglés Visita Overview ¿Por qué no Harvard? ¿Por qué no tú? Aquí, encontrarás información que te ayudará a conocer más de Harvard College, desde nuestro amplio programa de asistencia financiera hasta nuestro proceso de admisión holístico. Harvard College Aunque Harvard es conocida por su personal docente de primer nivel y sus infinitas oportunidades, creemos firmemente que una de nuestras principales fortalezas es la diversidad excepcional de nuestra comunidad. IMPORTANTE: Harvard College es la escuela de pregrado de Harvard University. Para información sobre programas de escuela posgrado (medicina, leyes, administración de empresas, educación, etc.), favor de consultar el directorio de escuelas para contactar la oficina apropiada. Calculator Calcule su beca estimada ¿Qué económico es Harvard? Mire para sí mismo con nuestra calculadora de precios netos. Calculadora de precios netos Pagando por tus estudios Una vez que un estudiante sea admitido en Harvard, trabajamos junto a su familia para asegurar que puedan pagar el costo de asistir la universidad. Estamos interesados en los mejores estudiantes, más allá de su situación económica. Por eso, nos comprometemos a cumplir plenamente con la necesidad financiera durante los cuatro años. Estudiantes internacionales tienen acceso a la misma ayuda financiera que sus compañeros estadounidenses, sin importar su estado de ciudadanía. De hecho, alrededor del 60% de estudiantes reciben becas de acuerdo a su necesidad con un costo promedio de $ 12.000 por año. 20% de nuestras familias no pagan nada. No se requieren préstamos como parte de nuestra ayuda financiera; la ayuda que ofrecemos es en la forma de becas. Tomamos como base dos principios fundamentales: La admisión en Harvard no toma en cuenta la habilidad de pago. Esto significa que tu necesidad financiera no afectará la posibilidad de ser admitido La ayuda financiera depende enteramente de la necesidad financiera, no del mérito Nuestros funcionarios de ayuda financiera estudiantil colaboran con las familias para determinar cuál es su necesidad financiera y el pago que les corresponderá hacer. Para muchas familias, esto representa entre el 0% y el 10% del ingreso familiar. También se le pedirá al estudiante que contribuya con el costo de su educación con empleo durante el año escolar y el verano. Consulta nuestra calculadora de precio neto para tener una idea de cuánto te costará una educación de Harvard. En menos de cinco minutos, tendrás un estimativo de tu paquete de ayuda financiera y del pago que le correspondería a tu familia. Creemos que te sorprenderá gratamente. Más información sobre cómo funciona la asistencia financiera ¿Por qué no Harvard? ¿Por qué no tú? This preview video does not contain audio. Ver el vídeo ℹ︎ Video End of embedded content Solicitudes Cada solicitante de Harvard College es cuidadosamente evaluado. No existen fórmulas para ser admitido, pero esperamos que esta información te ayude a comprender qué es lo que buscamos en nuestro proceso holístico de admisión. ¿Qué buscamos? Buscamos estudiantes prometedores que contribuirán a la comunidad de Harvard durante sus años en la universidad y que contribuirán a la sociedad más allá de la graduación. Aunque el desempeño académico es muy importante, el Comité de Admisiones considera muchos otros factores en sus decisiones: rasgos personales, talentos especiales o excelencia de toda clase, puntos de vista formados a partir de circunstancias personales o particulares, y la capacidad de aprovechar de las oportunidades y los recursos disponibles. Requisitos para presentar la solicitud Información para padres acerca de la solicitud Dominio del idioma inglés Los estudiantes deben tener un conocimiento sólido del idioma inglés, incluyendo la capacidad de comprender y expresar ideas de manera rápida y clara. No es obligatorio tomar el examen de aptitud en idioma inglés (TOEFL) ni otros exámenes de competencia idiomática. En caso de haberlos ya tomado, puedes presentar tus calificaciones como parte del solicitud, pero no es mandatorio. Solicitantes internacionales Harvard Virtual Tour https://www.youvisit.com/#/vte/?data-platform=v&data-link-type=immersive&data-i… Visita Asiste a una sesión informativa sobre admisiones y un recorrido . Visitar Harvard es una manera estupenda de aprender acerca de la vida diaria en la universidad, de conocer estudiantes actuales, y de explorar a Cambridge y Boston. Es más fácil experimentar que describir los aspectos intangibles de la comunidad de Harvard, el atmósfera de Harvard Yard, y la calidez y el entusiasmo de sus alumnos. Sabemos que muchos estudiantes no tienen la posibilidad de visitar las universidades antes de presentar sus solicitudes. Por eso, esperamos que nuestro sitio web sirva para destacar las vastas oportunidades de Harvard y la efusión de su comunidad. También puedes hacer un recorrido virtual para obtener una vista previa de Harvard desde la comodidad de tu hogar. Related Topics Virtual Tour If you can't make it to Cambridge to visit us, don't worry. Our virtual tour takes you around campus and into residential halls, classrooms, and more. Affordability For 90% of American families, Harvard is more affordable than their local state school. Diversity and Access When students come to Harvard, they bring their talent, curiosity, and intelligence. They also bring their perspective on the world.

Skip to main content Harvard College Primary Navigation About Admissions Financial Aid Academics Life at Harvard On Campus Information Sessions & Tours We welcome you to attend a campus visit of Harvard College. A campus visit consists of a one hour information session with an admissions officer and 1-2 current undergraduate students, followed by a one hour campus tour led by a current undergraduate student. Please note that the visit schedule is typically posted one month prior to each semester. There will be no on-campus information sessions and tours on Harvard College holidays, during other college closures and on most school breaks. We will conduct visits during the summer months in June and July. During scheduled off-times, we encourage you to attend a virtual information session. Registration Instructions Registration for a campus visit is required . To sign up, please select an available date from the calendar below. Multiple events may pop up when you select an available date. Click on the event labeled \"On-Campus Visit\" at the time that works for you, and then complete the registration form on a new page. Once your registration is complete, we will be in touch via email with helpful information to plan your visit and visit reminders. If you arrive on campus without registering, a member of our visitor team will help you to determine your best options including providing information about a self-guided tour and helping you to register for an open tour date and time. If the on-campus sessions are full, here are a few options for you: Sign up for an online session here - this is a 1 hour live session with an admissions officer. Click here to do a self-paced virtual tour of Harvard's campus. If you are in the area, you may stop by our office at 5 James Street from 9am-5pm Monday to Friday (11am-5pm on Wednesdays) and pick up a self-guided tour map and ask questions of the Visitor Center staff. COVID-19 Precautions A negative COVID test is not required to participate in campus information sessions and tours, however all visitors and their guests must agree neither they nor their family members will attend an event if they have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 10 days, been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 10 days, or experienced symptoms of COVID-19 within 48 hours prior to the event. An email reminder will go out to all registered attendees 48 hours before the event. Group Visits/Tours Visiting parties are limited to groups of 5. For groups of 6 or more, please contact the Harvard University Visitor Center to arrange a visit. If you are interested in bringing a group of students from a high school, community based organization (CBO), or other college access group serving students traditionally underrepresented in higher education, we would like to work with you to accommodate this request. You can request a visit here . Important information for your visit Special Accommodations - there will be space on the registration form to request special accommodations. Please note that we require 21 days advance notice in order to secure ASL interpreters. We cannot provide interpreters for other languages at this current time. Those requesting the use of a wheelchair must leave a current driver’s license or state ID with our Visitor Center personnel until the chair is returned. Most buildings are closed to the public. Public restrooms will be available in the Elizabeth Cary Agassiz House before/after the information session, and at the end of the tour at Smith Campus Center. At this time, it is not possible to store luggage or other personal property during your visit. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially for families who have traveled long distances to join us.

Harvard College founded in 1636, is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. Harvard College offers a four-year undergraduate, liberal arts program for students seeking their first degree. There are about 6,600 undergraduates at the College, with nearly equal numbers of men and women. In addition to Harvard College, Harvard University includes 12 graduate and professional schools , all of which offer programs for students who already hold their first degrees and seek advanced training in their fields through master's or doctoral programs. All 12 graduate and professional schools maintain their own admissions offices and teaching faculties, and they are run independently of Harvard College. For information about Harvard's graduate programs, please contact these schools' admissions offices directly. What is a \"liberal arts & sciences\" education? Commitment to liberal arts & sciences is at the core of Harvard College’s mission: before students can help change the world, they need to understand it. The liberal arts & sciences offer a broad intellectual foundation for the tools to think critically, reason analytically and write clearly. These proficiencies will prepare students to navigate the world’s most complex issues, and address future innovations with unforeseen challenges. Shaped by ideas encountered and created, these new modes of thinking will prepare students for leading meaningful lives, with conscientious global citizenship, to enhance the greater good. Harvard offers General Education courses that show the liberal arts and sciences in action. They pose enduring questions, they frame urgent problems, and they help students see that no one discipline can answer those questions or grapple with those problems on its own. Students are challenged to ask difficult questions, explore unfamiliar concepts, and indulge in their passion for inquiry and discovery across disciplines. Courses Can I fulfill academic requirements with previous coursework? Harvard does not accept credit for coursework completed before matriculation. Credentials such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma, Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, and other international credentials earned in secondary school can serve as valuable placement tools, and in some cases may be used to fulfill the language requirement . Harvard College does not grant degree credit for these kinds of pre-matriculation credentials. Can I concentrate in business, journalism, law, or medicine? While you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students. What should I know about Harvard's science and engineering programs? Science and engineering have long been priorities at Harvard. There are more than two dozen state-of-the-art facilities for science research at Harvard, and new computer science and chemistry laboratories opened in 2008. Moreover, forty-one of our former and current science faculty members have won Nobel Prizes. About half of recent entering students intend to major in the natural sciences, engineering, computer science or mathematics. Read more about engineering and applied science at www.seas.harvard.edu . How easy is it to change my concentration? About a third of undergraduates change fields after declaring their concentrations, which students do midway through their sophomore year. You would simply change concentrations in consultation with your departmental advisers. Learn more about the breadth of Harvard's academic programs . Are there required first-year classes? Harvard requires all first-year students to fulfill the expository writing requirement, a one- or two-semester course depending on placement . Otherwise, you may enroll in any Harvard College courses in which you are interested and for which you are prepared. How many courses does Harvard offer? Harvard offers more than 3,700 courses. For a complete copy of the course catalog, please visit registrar.fas.harvard.edu . Are there exchange programs with other Greater Boston colleges? You may cross-register in courses offered at MIT, which is a 10-minute trip from Harvard Yard. You may also enroll in graduate-level courses at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as well as at many of Harvard's professional schools . Faculty What percentage of faculty members teach undergraduates? Virtually 100 percent. Is it possible to get to know my professors? Yes. In addition to weekly office hours, students often spend time with their professors before and after class. There are also many occasions when professors take meals in Harvard's 12 residential dining halls; attend gatherings in the residences of Faculty Deans, who are themselves Harvard faculty members; and participate in other programs and special events. How large are classes? Some introductory courses as well as several other popular courses have large enrollments. Yet, the median class size at Harvard is 12. Of the nearly 1,300 courses offered last fall, for example, more than 1,000 of them enrolled 20 or fewer students. Campus Life What will my room look like? Most first-year dorms have suites for three to six students. Suites contain from two to four bedrooms and a common room. A few have their own baths, though most share a bathroom with other suites. The First-Year Experience Office assigns students to suites rather than to particular bedrooms, and in almost any suite students should expect to share a bedroom for at least part of the first year. Some dorms contain doubles, usually one fairly large room with a shared bath. Where will I take my meals? First-year students all eat together in Annenberg Hall. During sophomore through senior year, students typically eat in the dining hall located within their Houses, although students can choose to eat at other House dining halls as well. See more about dining . What extracurricular opportunities are available? There are more than 450 student-run organizations at Harvard, among them dozens of publications, five orchestras, an extensive community service program, more than 40 intercollegiate athletic teams, and a broad assortment of other activities—artistic, musical, political, and social. We encourage and support extracurricular opportunities as these provide important settings for personal growth and friendships. Visit the Dean of Students website for more information about extracurriculars. What security measures are in place at Harvard? Harvard has a comprehensive public safety program that includes a full campus police force, a walking escort service, a campus-wide shuttle service, emergency phones, lighted pathways and a computer-card key system operating in all residential buildings. Read Harvard's Annual Security Report on the Harvard University Police Department website . Is on-campus housing guaranteed? Harvard guarantees housing for all four years. First-year students live in one of the 17 dormitories in or adjacent to historic Harvard Yard. Self-selected groups of students are assigned to one of 12 residential Houses for the final three years of undergraduate study. About 350 to 500 students live in a House, each of which includes its own dining hall, library, advising staff, and many other resources. Read more about residential life . Must I live on campus? You must live in Harvard housing your first-year at the College. A very small percentage of students choose to live off-campus their following years. Most students and alumni consider the House system one of the hallmarks of their Harvard experiences. Considering the diversity of student backgrounds, interests, and talents, Harvard's residential program enhances the degree to which students learn from one another. Resources What advising and support services are available? Woven into Harvard's residences are a variety of academic and other advising resources that make the residential experience at Harvard distinctive. First-year students benefit from the guidance that resident proctors provide about living in Cambridge and studying at the College. Each House also has its own staff of advisers called resident tutors who are similar to first-year proctors but with expertise in particular academic and professional fields. Harvard offers extensive advising resources of other kinds. If you need extra help in coursework, you can turn to the Academic Resource Center . The Mignone Center for Career Success (MCS) offers career counseling. The University maintains its own outstanding health services . The Undergraduate Financial Aid Office will help you with financial aid issues, and the Student Employment Office will help place you in jobs on and off campus. Finally, if you are an international student, the International Office is there for your special needs. Does Harvard provide services if I have a disability? Yes. The Disability Access Office (DAO)—formerly the Accessible Education Office (AEO)—assists students with any impairment limiting their ability to walk, see, hear, speak, learn, or write. Based on each student's successful strategies, the Center collaborates with faculty and staff to ensure individualized accommodation. Accessible housing and transportation are also available. Read more about the DAO . Are there research opportunities for undergraduates? Yes - available to students as early as their freshman year. You may find research projects through individual inquiries with departments and professors, through the Harvard College Research Program (HCRP), or through the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program (MMUF). The Faculty Aide Program , run by the Student Employment Office, links professors to undergraduates interested in becoming research assistants. Read more about HCRP and MMUF on the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships website , and find additional opportunities on the Student Employment Office website . What sort of study abroad programs are available? Harvard students study abroad in classroom, laboratory, and field-based immersion programs throughout the world. In addition to greatly expanded study abroad opportunities, other international experiences such as public service internships and employment are offered. Generous funding is available for all students both during the school year and the summer. For more information about study abroad, visit the Office of International Programs website . Does Harvard provide specific resources for undocumented students? Harvard supports all of its students. The Office of Diversity Education & Support can help direct undergraduate undocumented students to advisers and counselors in the Bureau of Study Counsel , Mignone Center for Career Success , Harvard International Office , Student Employment Office , and University Health Services who can assist them. For legal questions, Harvard students can contact the Harvard Immigration & Refugee Clinic . Assistance is also available through Act on a Dream , a student organization that serves as a resource for undocumented undergraduates at the College. Life After Harvard Will attending Harvard College affect my chances of admission to Harvard University's graduate programs in business, medicine, or law? Harvard University's graduate programs are separate from and independent of Harvard College. Each Harvard graduate school makes its own admissions decisions. When reported, Harvard College undergraduates often make up the largest cohort of any incoming school to our various graduate programs. What is Harvard's graduation rate? The College's graduation rate is normally 98 percent, among the highest at American colleges and universities. Everyone admitted to Harvard has the ability to complete all academic requirements successfully. How successful are Harvard students in gaining admission to graduate schools or finding employment after graduation? Our graduates enjoy an extraordinarily high rate of success receiving job offers and admission to graduate and professional schools. Resident tutors in each of the twelve residential Houses assist students applying to graduate schools and fellowship programs. The Mignone Center for Career Success (MCS) offers all undergraduates a range of job and internship counseling and placement. Foreign citizens should be aware that some special policies pertain should they seek employment in the U.S. after graduation.

If you do not meet these indicators, please email adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu to request a fee waiver. Early Action I was deferred. Is there really any chance that I still can be admitted? It is impossible to predict individual admission decisions. Past students whose applications were deferred have been admitted at various rates, often approximating the rate for Regular Decision candidates. Over the next few months, your application will be reviewed again, supplying another opportunity for eventual admission. I was deferred. What can I do to improve my chances of admission? In most cases, the essential details are already on file with the Admissions Committee. Additional information (sent via the Applicant Portal ) should be limited to significant developments in your high school career. We will also expect to receive your Midyear School Report no later than February 1. Do I need to communicate directly with the admissions staff member who read my file about my deferral? Despite what you may hear or read elsewhere, no; this is wholly unnecessary. Our decisions are made by a committee of admission officers, including faculty members, no single one of whom is responsible for shaping the outcome of deliberations. Can I apply via rolling admission to another university if I want to apply Restrictive Early Action to Harvard? If you intend on applying REA to Harvard, you may not apply rolling admission to a private university until after REA decisions are released, but you may apply rolling admission to a public or international university if the decision is non-binding. If I apply restrictive early action to Harvard, may I apply to another private college's early action program (restrictive or not)? No. However, you may apply Early Action to any public college/university or to universities outside the U.S. If I apply restrictive early action to Harvard, may I apply to another college's early decision program? You cannot apply to another college’s binding early decision program until we have released Restrictive Early Action (REA) decisions in mid-December. After students receive Harvard's REA notifications, including a deferral, they are free to apply to any institution under any plan, including binding programs such as Early Decision II. You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. I am applying to colleges outside of the U.S. May I apply to them at the same time as I apply Restrictive Early Action to Harvard? Yes. May I apply to another college under its Regular Decision plan before I receive Harvard's decision on my Restrictive Early Action application? In the case of a Regular Decision program with no early consideration of any kind, you may apply at any point before their deadline. In the case of early deadlines for special considerations, you may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Why was my application deferred? Competition for early admission to Harvard College has, in recent years, been especially rigorous. Given that more than 60,000 candidates apply from around the world, and the relatively modest size of each entering class (about 1,650 students), the Admissions Committee must act with great care in making Restrictive Early Action Decisions. As a result, many strong applicants are deferred to the Regular Decision round for review. Testing How should I prepare for standardized tests? Our admissions committee understands that opportunities to prepare for standardized tests vary greatly for students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. You may find it helpful to utilize free-test prep from Khan Academy or join a free SAT bootcamp on Schoolhouse.world. The ACT and College Board provide sample tests to practice.  Such free programs could help students from under-resourced schools by providing the academic tools that will serve them well on standardized tests and also in college. Students can also do well by studying widely and deeply  on their own with the help of family, school, or community organizations. Khan Academy Schoolhouse.world What if I do not have access to SAT or ACT testing in my hometown or home country? What if it would be a financial hardship for me to access a SAT or ACT test site elsewhere? The Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to access SAT or ACT test sites. If students attend schools that offer SAT or ACT testing onsite, or live or attend schools close to accessible test sites, we will expect them to take the tests and submit scores with their Harvard application. However, if students do not have access to nearby test sites, the Admissions Committee still welcomes applications from these students. We encourage students in that situation to submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP results/IB/GCSE/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results. What if it would be a financial hardship to register for the test? If the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP results or IB/GCSE/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results. Why did Harvard decide to require standardized testing again? The decision to return to requiring testing was motivated by a number of important new insights, including research led by Harvard faculty members that confirms the role of standardized testing to help predict college and post-college success for students, including those from less-resourced backgrounds, particularly when considered together with other academic credentials. We also know that, when given the choice, many applicants choose not to submit scores. This can disadvantage some students, including low-income and minority applicants, who also may be disadvantaged in other aspects of their application because of lack of academic opportunity. More information about an applicant, especially such strongly predictive information, can be valuable. Reinstating a testing requirement will bring important and consistent information back into the admissions process. In Harvard’s whole-person review process, testing is just one data point among many considered carefully with the expertise of the admissions committee. We recognize that this requirement brings certain challenges. Access to testing should never prevent a student from applying to Harvard. In addition to providing alternative test options for those who cannot access the SAT or ACT, Harvard College Admissions provides information on sources for no-cost tutoring and test preparation . Which standardized tests does Harvard require? Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions English language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo cannot be used to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials. Students may self report their standardized test scores. If the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results. How will the Admissions Committee evaluate my test scores? When reading an application, the Admissions Committee reviews test scores, along with all other aspects of the application, to get to know the person behind the numbers. Harvard has found that SAT and ACT scores are  the best predictors of Harvard grades. The Committee also understands that SAT and ACT tests are one aspect of a student’s application. Admissions officers take into consideration that not all students attend well-resourced schools throughout their lives, and that those who come from modest economic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for standardized tests. Each application to Harvard is read with great care, keeping in mind the context of a student’s high school and community and in recognition that talent is everywhere, but opportunity and access are not. What if English is not my first language? A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. Throughout the application, we will look for evidence that an applicant has the necessary English language proficiency. We do not require the TOEFL or other English language exams, but students may choose to submit their results. What if I am a military veteran and never took the SAT or ACT? The Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to access the SAT or ACT test. The Committee welcomes applications from military veterans who may not have taken the SAT or ACT while they were in high school. We encourage students in this situation to submit results from other standardized tests to which they may have had access. For instance, students may submit AP results or results from other standardized tests taken in school. Does Harvard consider scores from previous administrations of the SAT or ACT? Yes. Do I need a minimum required SAT or ACT score? The Admissions Committee does not have testing cutoffs for applicants. All completed applications are read and carefully considered by the committee. Testing is one academic factor among many that the committee considers in relation to the norms of a student’s high school. In the last year that Harvard required testing, the range (10th percentile to 90th percentile) of SAT scores for enrolling students was 670 to 790 for Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and 680 to 800 for Math.  The range (10th percentile to 90th percentile) of ACT Composite scores was 31 to 36. If I take the ACT and/or SAT more than once, which results does Harvard consider? We consider your best test scores, but it is the general experience that taking tests more than twice offers diminishing returns. Does Harvard superscore test results? We do not create superscores for applicants. We will evaluate your application noting the highest test scores in each section across test dates for the SAT and your strongest sitting for the ACT.  We take into account your educational background when reviewing your scores. You may choose to send your ACT superscores to Harvard. When you do so, we will also receive the full results from your best sitting, including highest composite from a single test date. Can I self-report my test scores? Yes. Applicants may provide self-reported test scores. Admitted students who self-report SAT and ACT scores and decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official SAT and ACT test scores upon enrolling. Other test scores will be reviewed through the final transcript review process. View our application tips for specific information on how to self-report your scores. If you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying.  We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard. How will Harvard evaluate the new digital SAT? The College Board's shift to a digital delivery of the SAT will not impact the way in which Harvard reviews test scores within applications. Please visit the College Board FAQs for more information. Process What should students know about visas? Admitted international students will be provided with information about applying for a student visa. Are my chances of admission enhanced by submitting application materials before other applicants? No. The deadlines are November 1 for Restrictive Early Action and January 1 for Regular Decision. I have a bachelor's degree. May I apply to Harvard College? No student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the 12 Harvard University graduate schools . The Harvard College Admissions Office is independent of these schools and their admissions policies. May I defer my admission once admitted? Yes. Students admitted in the Early Action and Regular Decision rounds can choose to defer their admission by selecting the \"I defer\" option in their admitted student reply form. We want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much reported \"burnout\" phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the nation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college. The admissions committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way - provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college. Deferrals for two years are also considered for such purposes as military or religious service or under other unique circumstances, and subject to the approval of the admissions committee. Each year, between 90 and 130 students defer their matriculation to the College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. After graduation, large numbers of Harvard students take time off before beginning work or graduate school. Read more about taking time off . If a student has already replied as enrolling, but has since changed their mind and would like to defer, they may contact the Admissions Office or submit the Request to Defer form on the Admitted Students Website explaining the request for a deferral as soon as possible and in any event by the end of June. What admissions criteria do you use? There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities. May I apply to Harvard if I am admitted under a binding Early Decision program at another college? No. If you are admitted under an Early Decision program at another college, you must withdraw any pending application to Harvard and you are not eligible for admission. How familiar is the Admissions Committee with secondary schools? Their rigor? What marks mean in a particular school or educational system? We have worked hard for many years to learn about schools around the world. Our careful study of different schools, curricula and educational systems is augmented by information we receive directly from schools, extensive personal communication with school personnel, and the interview reports we receive from our alumni, who meet thousands of applicants to Harvard each year. We can always learn more, so we welcome information students think might be helpful to the Admissions Committee in understanding their accomplishments in their school communities. Does Harvard consider legal immigration status in the admissions process? All students are considered in the same pool for admission to the incoming class regardless of citizenship status. While being undocumented may present challenges for students wishing to travel or work on campus, immigration status is not considered by the admissions committee. Does Harvard rank secondary schools in the U.S. and abroad? No. While we understand there are differences in the overall strengths of secondary schools, we are most interested in how well applicants have taken advantage of available resources. In the end, we admit the student not the secondary school they attend. Can I (as an applicant) write about my race/ethnicity in my application materials? Can I (as a counselor or teacher) write about a student’s race/ethnicity in my letter of recommendation? Just as in previous admissions cycles, applicants and those writing on behalf of applicants should feel welcome to write about any aspect of the applicant’s identity or background, including race and/or ethnicity. You do not have to withhold any information in any part of the application (e.g. extracurricular list, personal essay, Harvard’s supplemental questions , letters of recommendation, etc.) because of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding affirmative action. As the applicant, you are welcome to check the race/ethnicity boxes when completing the application, though that information will not be shared in the transmission of application data for review. As our admissions committee members review applications, it is incumbent on our staff to comply with the ruling of the Supreme Court in which we cannot consider race/ethnicity in our review of applications. Who should write my recommendations? Teachers who know you well and who have taught you in academic subjects (preferably in the final two years of secondary school) typically will provide us with the most valuable testimony. Whenever possible, teachers should tell us about your non-academic interests and personal qualities as well as academic potential. Who reads applications? Applications are read by members of the forty-person Admissions Committee, and are considered very carefully in a series of committee meetings where a majority vote is required for admission. The entire process requires several months. Is there a wait list? Yes. Our wait list includes the applicants whom the Committee might still wish to consider for admission if spots in the entering class open later. The wait list is not ranked. In some years, we have admitted no one from the wait list; in others, we have admitted more than 200 candidates. Does Harvard admit students to enter in the spring semester? No. All students begin study in September to benefit from special programs designed for freshmen. Are there quotas for certain kinds of applicants? The Admissions Committee does not use quotas of any kind. Is there a separate admissions process for prospective athletes? No. We encourage students with athletic talent to contact our Athletic Department for information about any of Harvard's 42 varsity athletic teams. Criteria What is included in the Harvard supplement? The supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard? Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you. If my curriculum requires more than the 12-year U.S. curriculum, may I apply after my twelfth year? We strongly recommend you complete whichever curriculum you have been following. Applicants who have completed only a year of GCE A-levels or International Baccalaureate study, for instance, are at a tremendous disadvantage in our applicant pool. Can I fulfill academic requirements with previous coursework? Harvard does not accept credit for coursework completed before matriculation. Credentials such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma, Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, and other international credentials earned in secondary school can serve as valuable placement tools, and in some cases may be used to fulfill the language requirement . Harvard College does not grant degree credit for these kinds of pre-matriculation credentials. How important are extracurricular activities in admissions decisions? Each case is different. Some students distinguish themselves for admission with their unusual academic promise through experience or achievements in study or research. Other students present compelling cases because they are more \"well-rounded,\" having contributed in many different ways to their schools or communities. Still other successful applicants are \"well-lopsided\" with demonstrated excellence in one particular endeavor. Some students bring perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances or experiences. Like many colleges, we seek to admit dynamic, talented, and diverse students who will contribute significantly to the education of their classmates. Are there secondary school course requirements for admission? There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. An ideal four-year preparatory program includes four years of English, with extensive practice in writing; four years of math*; four years of science: biology, chemistry, physics, and an advanced course in one of these subjects; three years of history, including American and European history; and four years of one foreign language. *​​Applicants to Harvard should excel in a challenging high school math sequence corresponding to their educational interests and aspirations. We recommend that applicants take four years of math courses in high school. Ideally, these math courses will focus on conceptual understanding, promote higher-order thinking, and encourage students to use mathematical reasoning to critically examine the world. Examples include rigorous and relevant courses in computer science, statistics and its subfields, mathematical modeling, calculus, and other advanced math subjects. Students’ math records are viewed holistically, and no specific course is required. Specifically, calculus is not a requirement for admission to Harvard. We understand that applicants do not have the same opportunities and course offerings in their high schools. Moreover, many programs of study at Harvard do not require knowledge of calculus. We encourage applicants to take the courses that are available to them and aligned with their interests and goals. Students intending to study engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other fields where calculus is needed may benefit from taking calculus in high school. However, students at Harvard can still pursue such fields by starting with one of our introductory calculus classes that has no high school calculus prerequisite. On balance, we encourage all students to master foundational mathematical material instead of rushing through any of the more advanced courses. Will it help me to take advanced, accelerated or honors courses? Yes. Although schools provide different opportunities, students should pursue the most demanding college-preparatory program available, consistent with each student's readiness for particular fields of study. Counselors can offer helpful advice as students choose their courses. Do I need certain grades or marks to be considered for admission? We recognize that schools vary by size, academic program, and grading policies, so we do not have rigid grade requirements. There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. We do seek students who achieve at a high level, and most admitted students rank in the top 10-15% of their graduating classes. Are my chances of admission enhanced if a relative has attended Harvard? The application process is the same for all candidates. Among a group of similarly distinguished applicants, the children of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look. Is there an age requirement for applying to Harvard? There is not an age requirement for applying to Harvard, though applicants are expected to have some secondary school experience. What if I have completed most or all of my secondary school coursework through self-study? Harvard College's academic program emphasizes in-person peer engagement and student-faculty interactions. For the Admissions Committee to make the best assessment of an applicant's ability to succeed at Harvard, we encourage self-study applicants to submit third-party confirmation of their knowledge and learning behaviors. These documents can include course certificates, publications, patent registrations, and/or letters of recommendation from academic mentors or teachers. Submitted Applications I submitted something by mistake. Can you remove it from my file? Unfortunately, we are not able to remove materials from your file after they have been submitted. However, you may write an explanation of the materials that have been submitted by mistake and/or why you’d like them to be removed, and we will add this new information to your file. I submitted the application, but I no longer want to be considered for admission. Can I withdraw my application? You may withdraw your application using the withdrawal form in the Applicant Portal . You may also send an email to fileroom@fas.harvard.edu with the subject line: Withdraw Application. Please be sure to write from the email address you used on the Common Application. We are not able to withdraw an application based on a request from someone other than the applicant. What if my supplement wasn't submitted? If you discover that your supplement was not submitted with your application, please log into your applicant portal and use the material uploader tool to upload your supplement (in a word doc or PDF). Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials) Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the Applicant Portal . This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application. The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty. Can I add to or change something I wrote on my Common Application forms? Unfortunately, you are not able to add to or change the Common Application forms after they have been submitted. However, you may upload additional information and materials using the Applicant Portal. My contact information has changed since I submitted my application. How can I correct it? You can update your contact information on the Applicant Status Portal . If you need to update information that is not available on the Portal, please contact fileroom@fas.harvard.edu . How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application? We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the Applicant Portal . I submitted my application, but did not receive a confirmation email from Harvard. How do I know if you received it? We begin processing applications in September, and we confirm the receipt of each application to each applicant via email. Most applicants receive their application acknowledgement email the day after they submit their application (if it was submitted online). If you have submitted your application more than 2 weeks ago, and still have not received a confirmation email from us, it is likely that our email was undeliverable for some reason. Please check to make sure that your email account settings allow emails from college@fas.harvard.edu and fileroom@fas.harvard.edu . Also, please check any filtered mailboxes for spam/junk email to see if your confirmation was filtered there. If you are still unable to locate your confirmation, it is possible that we have not received your application. If you submitted your application through the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, please make sure that you have clicked the button to \"Submit\" and not just \"Save.\" Once you have made sure that you have actually submitted your application and still have no confirmation, please send us an email with your full name, date of birth, and school. Let us know when you submitted your application and how, so that we may consult our records accordingly. I applied under Restrictive Early Action, but I would like to be considered under Regular Decision. Can I change my application? (Or, I applied under Regular Decision and would like to be considered under Restrictive Early Action.) To change your application program, use the form in your Applicant Portal . You do not need to submit a new application; your submitted materials will simply be reviewed on a different time-table. I reported my SAT scores to Harvard, but my status page says they haven’t been received. Why? Though you may have ordered your scores, it can sometimes take a couple of weeks for your scores to be officially sent and processed in our office. If your official scores do not show in your status page after a couple of weeks, please double check with the testing agency to make sure they were sent. Once you have confirmed the delivery, please check the name and personal information used on your scores. If this varies, even slightly, from what you have listed on your application, your scores will be automatically stored in a separate entry in our database. If this is the case, you can send an email to scores@fas.harvard.edu listing the discrepancy in your name/info, and your scores will be merged with your application file. I did not receive a PIN to access the applicant portal. Can I get a new one? When you submitted your application, we sent a confirmation email to the email address you listed on your application that included a PIN to access the applicant portal and create your own password. However, these e-mails are sent out in bulk from fileroom@fas.harvard.edu or college@fas.harvard.edu , so please check your spam/junk folder. We begin sending application acknowledgement emails in mid-September, so if you applied before then, please wait to receive this email from us before contacting our office. If you have checked your email inbox and your spam folder, and you are still unable to find your application acknowledgement email, please contact the Admissions Office so that we can re-send it to you. Financial Aid: General Challenging Circumstances What if my family's financial situation changes while I am attending Harvard? You may request a review of your financial aid decision at any time to accommodate significant changes in your family's financial situation. You must apply for financial aid each year. We will meet your demonstrated need for all four years. Can I apply for Harvard's financial aid independently of my parents? No, in 99% of the cases. We feel strongly that your parents have an obligation to help finance your college education. Our aid is available only to students whose families would not otherwise be able to send them to Harvard. What if my parents refuse to pay for my college education? To be fair to all our students, we can base our financial aid decisions only on ability and not willingness to pay, and a decision to attend Harvard must be made by you and your parents. Please contact the Financial Aid Office to discuss this further if you have questions or concerns. Cost of Attendance Why is my personal expenses estimate lower this year? The cost of attendance used in calculating financial aid packages has, for many years, included a standard personal expenses allowance, meant to represent what you will spend on out-of-pocket costs like books and supplies, toiletries, laundry, entertainment etc. Starting in the 23-24 school year, we have split this expense into a “books and supplies” category, and a “personal expenses” category, in order to be clearer about what students may spend on books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. There has been no change to how these items work in your financial aid package – this is simply a language change. What’s the difference between “room and board” and “housing and food”? For many years we have used the term “room” to represent the cost of housing at Harvard, and “board” to represent the cost of the meal plan. Students were charged “room” and “board” fees as part of their student term bill, and received aid towards “room and board” costs. The Department of Education has asked that schools change this language to “housing” and “food” costs. This is simply a language change meant to make costs clearer and easier to understand; there has been no change to how housing or meals work at Harvard, or to the amounts charged and used in financial aid calculations. What is the “books and supplies” portion of my financial aid package? The cost of attendance used in calculating financial aid packages includes a standard estimate of what you will spend on books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. This is an ‘unbilled’ or ‘out-of-pocket’ expense, meaning that you will purchase your own books and supplies – you will not see a charge for books and supplies on your term bill. Jobs What is the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP)? When you apply for aid, your financial aid package will indicate your eligibility for the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP). The Federal Work-Study Program subsidizes the wages of eligible students, making them particularly attractive to employers. If you are eligible, you will be able to work in FWSP-designated jobs at the University (and sometimes off campus as well). FWSP funds are available for both term-time and summer employment. Browse the Student Employment Office jobs database for FWSP eligible jobs. What is a Term-Time Work Expectation? The term-time work expectation listed on your award letter is the amount of earnings during the academic year that we expect you to contribute toward your college costs. All earnings are paid directly to you, and it will be your responsibility to determine what portion of your earnings will be used towards billed (tuition, fees, housing and food, etc.) and/or non-billed (transportation and personal expenses, etc.) expenses. Students can work while at Harvard, but only some students are eligible for the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP). Your financial aid letter will designate whether you can work in a job funded by FWSP or need to focus your job search on positions not funded by the program. Please note: You may request a student loan to replace or supplement part or all of a job expectation (term-time or FWSP). To request a loan, use the Loan Request Form . Am I required to work if I am an international student and I qualify for financial aid? There is no requirement to work. However, all students, international or American, who demonstrate financial need will have a student term-time work expectation as part of their financial aid package, which they can typically meet with a job requiring about 10-12 hours per week. U.S. immigration regulations allow foreign nationals to work on-campus only, and they restrict the amount of time a foreign student can spend working while attending college (10-12 hours per week is well under their limit). Jobs are plentiful and are often interesting and relevant to academic interests. Is it easy to find a student job on or near campus? Jobs are plentiful at Harvard. Employment opportunities range from dining hall duties to work in the University's libraries, laboratories, and offices. Students have also earned money on campus as bartenders, teaching assistants, sportswriters, computer programmers, lifeguards and research assistants, to cite a few examples. Working eight to twelve hours on average per week, most students find that they can work, excel academically, and participate in a range of extracurricular activities. Read more at our Student Employment Office website. Loans Where can I find parent financing information? Many of our families find parent loans to be a useful tool for spreading the cost of education over a number of years. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of education, less any other financial aid. Parent loans are not based on financial need, and there are no income restrictions or penalties for early repayment. Harvard processes PLUS loans directly with the U.S. Department of Education through the Federal Direct Lending Program, without the need for banks and for-profit lenders. However, your financing options are not limited to the parent PLUS loan; you and your family may borrow from any lender you choose. Are loans available if I choose not to work? Most students do choose to work. If you will have heavy extracurricular demands on your time (such as playing football in the fall or acting in a spring drama production), you could choose to meet the job expectation partially or completely through student loans. Outside Awards What is considered an outside award? In assessing your financial need, we first look at your family’s particular income and assets in order to come up with a student and parent contribution based on your individual financial need. Any funds that you receive from an organization outside your family that are intended for your educational expenses would be considered outside awards. Since outside awards are additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your parent contribution (which was calculated based on your parents’ income and assets). Here are some examples of outside awards: Funds from your secondary school Funds from city, state, or national organizations Funds from nonprofit organizations and businesses Funds from your parents’ employers Funds from government scholarships like ROTC If the funds are meant to pay for your educational expenses, they are outside awards and will be incorporated into your financial aid package according to our outside award policy . You Harvard scholarship funding is not an outside award. Student wages, thesis grants, summer research grants, and other similar grants are not outside awards, since they are not directly meant to pay your standard cost of attendance. If you are receiving funding from an outside organization and are unclear of how to report it, please contact us and we’ll let you know. What happens to my financial aid award if I receive additional outside assistance? A large percentage of each entering first-year class receives one or more outside awards from national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100% of the total outside award amount is first deducted from your work expectation. If the total of outside awards exceeds your work expectation, that excess amount is deducted from the Harvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need, they may not be used to replace your parents' contribution or other expected family resource. For example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,500 job, and a $15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and $1,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $500. Only if outside awards exceeded $3,500 would they have any impact upon the amount of Harvard Scholarship. What do I need to do to report outside award(s)? If you expect to receive an outside scholarship that is not reflected on your award letter, including tuition benefits from parents’ employers, you should report it to the Financial Aid Office by visiting the Outside Award Reporting System (OARS) . This is found under the Financial Aid tab of your My.Harvard student portal. We will adjust the financial aid package to reflect the receipt of additional resources. Where should I send outside award checks? Checks are processed by the Student Accounts Office (not the Financial Aid Office). Please send your checks to: Student Accounts Office Attn: Outside Awards 801 Smith Campus Center 1350 Massachusetts Ave. Cambridge, MA 02138 617-495-2739 Where should I send Cost of Attendance or Verification of Enrollment forms? If an outside organization is requiring you to have a Cost of Attendance or Verification of Enrollment form signed by an official at Harvard, please use the following: Cost of Attendance Forms: Harvard College Griffin Financial Aid Office Attn: Outside Award Coordinator 86 Brattle Street Cambridge, MA 02138 Verification of Enrollment: Please visit the website of the Office of the Registrar . How are funds I receive from my parents' employers (such as faculty tuition benefits or employer paid tuition assistance) factored into my financial aid package? Tuition benefits that you receive from your parents' employers meant for your educational costs would be considered outside awards and would be factored into your financial aid package following our outside award policy . Funds from outside awards are incorporated into your financial aid package in two steps: First to replace the term-time job expectation. If you have outside awards that exceed your term-time work expectation the remaining amount would replace an equal amount of Harvard scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your parent contribution. How are funds I receive from organizations like National Merit, the Gates Scholars Program, and Jack Kent Cooke factored into my financial aid package? Funds from outside organizations meant for your educational costs would be considered outside awards and would be factored into your financial aid package following our outside award policy . Funds from outside awards are incorporated into your financial aid package in two steps: First to replace the term-time job expectation. If you have outside awards that exceed your term-time work expectation the remaining amount would replace an equal amount of Harvard scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your parent contribution. How are funds I receive from programs like ROTC factored into my financial aid package?

Funds from outside awards are incorporated into your financial aid package in two steps: First to replace the term-time job expectation. If you have outside awards that exceed your term-time work expectation the remaining amount would replace an equal amount of Harvard scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your parent contribution. Refunds Where do I request a refund from my term bill account? You may request a refund here . Financial Aid Application FAFSA Simplification What is FAFSA Simplification? The federal government has passed legislation to significantly change the FAFSA with the goal of making the FAFSA easier and faster to complete. You can read more about FAFSA Simplification on the Federal Student Aid website . How will FAFSA Simplification affect financial aid deadlines? The FAFSA is usually available starting October 1, and we usually ask Early Action applicants to submit the FAFSA by November 1. Based on significant changes to the 24-25 FAFSA made by the Department of Education, the 24-25 FAFSA did not open until late December 2023. For this reason, we have not asked Early Action applicants to submit the 24-25 FAFSA until February 1, 2024. There are no changes to Regular Action or Transfer application deadlines, nor to the deadlines for current Harvard students. Will FAFSA Simplification change my aid eligibility? The FAFSA determines your eligibility for federal and state financial aid, including the Pell Grant, Federal Work-Study funds, and subsidized federal student loans. While the new methodology may change your eligibility for federal financial aid, it does not determine your eligibility for aid from Harvard. At Harvard, we will continue to use our own methodology to determine your eligibility for our need-based financial aid (read more about this in our How Aid Works section ). We first determine a family contribution, based on your family’s financial circumstances, and then meet your full financial need using Harvard’s funds as well as any federal or state funds for which you are eligible. What will change about my Early Action financial aid estimate after I submit my FAFSA? If you are admitted to Harvard during Early Action and have met your financial aid deadlines, you will receive an estimated financial aid decision around the time you receive your admissions decision. This will include a parent and student contribution, an estimated cost of attendance (which will be updated in the Spring when tuition and fees have been set for 24-25), and your total eligibility for grant aid. When we have received and processed your FAFSA, we will update this grant eligibility to break out funding from Harvard, federal, and state sources. Since we use our own methodology to determine your parent and student contribution, this will in most cases not change these parts of your financial aid package. If the information on your FAFSA conflicts with information submitted on the rest of your application materials (for example, if you report an investment account that you forgot to include on the CSS Profile), we will reach out to resolve these differences and may update your financial aid decision if the updated information changes your eligibility for financial aid. Since the FAFSA determines your eligibility for Federal Work-Study funding and subsidized federal student loans, we will also update you on your eligibility for these programs after your FAFSA has been submitted and reviewed. We expect to send out finalized financial aid decisions around April 1 to students who meet the listed financial aid deadlines. Late applications will be reviewed as soon as possible after this point. CSS Profile How will I know that the CSS Profile has been submitted correctly? You will receive an email confirmation from the College Board after the CSS Profile has been submitted. What do I do if I have already filed my CSS Profile, but other documents are missing from my financial aid application? You should have received an email from the College Board’s Institutional Documentation Service ( IDOC ) providing you with instructions on how to submit your tax forms and any other supplemental forms that may be required. All requested documents, should be uploaded to IDOC . What if I am a foreign citizen who is unable to submit a CSS Profile online? The CSS Profile is available to students from nearly every country and nationality. The College Board is unable to process payments from a small number of countries, and so students from these countries may not be able to submit the CSS Profile. If this is the case for you, please follow this alternate set of instructions to apply for financial aid. Can foreign students use the CSS Profile? Yes! That is actually the best form to use. Do I need to do both the CSS Profile AND the Financial Statement for Students from Foreign Countries? No. Those two forms are interchangeable. If you are able do the CSS Profile, it is the preferred form. What is Harvard’s School Code for the CSS Profile? Our CSS Profile code is 3434. What should I do if I make a mistake on the CSS Profile? We understand that the tax numbers on the Profile may be estimates and will update them with your actual taxes when those arrive through IDOC. If you have major changes or corrections to make beyond those that will be automatically updated by your tax returns, you can update your Profile application once by clicking “Correct Your CSS Profile” on your CSS Profile Dashboard. Should I complete the CSS Profile even if my family has not yet filed our current year tax returns? Yes. You and your parents should use the income information on your W-2 forms or paycheck stubs to estimate the figures that will appear on your tax returns. Such estimates are perfectly acceptable for all students. Divorced/Separated What should I do if the CSS Profile from Noncustodial Household is missing? If your parents are divorced or separated, each household must fill out their own CSS Profile. You should direct your second parent to complete the CSS Profile online. If you are an international student and chose to file the paper Financial Statement for Students from Foreign Countries, please have your noncustodial parent to complete and submit a separate form along with their most recent tax return or wage statement. What if I cannot ask one of my parents to send in their financial information? If you are unable to ask a parent to send in their financial information, please fill out a Parent Information Sheet including a letter from a third party and any additional documentation as appropriate. Given that every family situation is unique, we review parent and household information on a case-by-case basis to determine what documentation and paperwork is appropriate for that student to provide to us in an effort to be as generous as possible with our financial aid assessment. Since we do not review financial information until a positive admissions decision has been made, we cannot make a judgment call on the documentation required until that point in the process. Please rest assured that our financial aid application deadlines are flexible and that we will be in direct touch with the student, should a positive admissions decision be made and the financial aid application is incomplete. FAFSA What should I do if I make a mistake on the FAFSA? You may log back in to the FAFSA website, change the erroneous information, and resubmit the FAFSA. Should I complete the FAFSA even if my family has not yet filed our current tax returns? We would prefer that you wait to file your FAFSA until your taxes are complete. If at all possible, please use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to complete the FAFSA. However, if the application deadline is near, you should file the FAFSA using estimates. How will I know that the FAFSA has been submitted correctly? You can check the status of your FAFSA here . Please allow one week for processing an online signature, and three weeks for processing a paper signature page. I'm a Canadian citizen; do I have to file a FAFSA? No, only US Citizens and Eligible Permanent Residents should file the FAFSA. (If you are a citizen of both the US and Canada, you should file a FAFSA.) What is Harvard’s Federal School Code for the FAFSA? Our Federal School Code for the FAFSA is E00468. Who can help me troubleshoot technical difficulties with the FAFSA? The Department of Education maintains and supports the FAFSA. You can find their help page at https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/help , and you can find a list of contact centers at https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact . You can contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center by phone at 1-800-433-3243. IDOC What is the College Board Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC)? IDOC is a service provided by the College Board which families use to securely submit financial aid application documentation. Applicants who fill out the CSS Profile form are able to submit taxes and other relevant forms to IDOC. You can learn more here . How will I know that my IDOC materials have been submitted correctly? Sign in here. Please allow five or more business days for processing. Remember that the staff at IDOC are only trained to identify basic US tax documents and these are the only ones that will show up on IDOC's tracking. If you have read through our application instructions and submitted what we ask for, then you should not worry about whether IDOC has been able to correctly identify and track your documents. Our staff will review the IDOC materials for all admitted students and current undergraduates to make sure your submissions fulfill our requirements and will reach out if there is anything more we need. Fee Waiver How can I get a financial aid fee waiver? Harvard does not charge a financial aid application fee. However, the financial aid application does include submission of the CSS Profile, an application independent of Harvard but that will normally require the payment of a fee. For CSS Profile fee waiver requests: If you are a US Citizen or Permanent Resident you will automatically be evaluated for a waiver of the CSS Profile application fee at the point that you submit your CSS Profile data to the College Board. The College Board is wholly responsible for these fee waivers and will grant a waiver using their guidelines.  You can learn more on their website here: https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/fee-waivers . International students for whom the cost of the CSS Profile is prohibitive or who live in countries from which the College Board cannot process payments can follow these instructions to apply through our alternate application process . Admission application fee waiver requests are explained here: ( https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver ) I can't afford the Profile fee and I'm foreign, so I can't get a College Board waiver. Please follow our alternate instructions for applying through our paper process. I can't pay the Profile fee because the US won't accept credit card payments from my country. Please follow these alternate instructions for applying through our paper process. Missing Documents What should I do if my CSS Profile is missing? Please complete your CSS Profile online. The Harvard College CSS code number is 3434. Once your CSS Profile has been completed, you will be able to use the College Board’s Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) to submit your tax forms and any other supplemental forms that may be required. Remember, it is important to provide your Social Security Number, if you have one, when you register for CSS Profile; Harvard will use this unique number to identify your data before loading any electronic records. NOTE: If you are a returning student and do not have a Social Security Number, please provide your Harvard ID number in the SSN field when you register for the CSS Profile. If you are a prospective/entering student and do not have a Social Security Number, please be sure to provide the same first, last and middle name, as well as birth date on the CSS Profile that you provided on your Harvard admissions application. What if tax documents are missing and I have already sent my materials to IDOC? Your parents and/or non-custodial parents should upload signed copies of their most recent federal tax return(s) with attending schedules to IDOC. Note that we will not be able to finalize your financial aid award until we receive your actual  federal tax returns with all schedules - these should also be sent to IDOC as soon as they become available.) If you are an international student and a national tax return is not filed, your parents should ask each employer to submit a wage statement detailing their annual compensation. What should I do if the Business/Farm Supplement is missing? You can find the form on our website under Financial Aid Forms . Please fill out a Business/Farm Supplement for each business and/or farm in which your family has an interest or ownership. What should I do if a Cash Flow Statement is missing? You can download the form here . It should be submitted through your IDOC portal. What if my student tax return is missing but I didn't file a return? If you are not required to file a federal or national tax return, you should complete and submit a tax non-filer statement. You can find a tax non-filer statement either on our website (US students would use the federal tax non-filer statement; international students would use the international tax non-filer statement) or through your IDOC Portal. How can I see what is missing/received and when? We are not able to track financial aid application materials for prospective students until they have been admitted. If a student is admitted and indicated they wished to apply for aid, we will let them know at that point what has been received or is missing. For current students, you can see what is missing and/or received by logging into my.harvard. We will not begin tracking documents for the next academic year until mid-February before that year starts, at which time we will post which documents are received/missing on your my.harvard.edu portal. Until that point, the documents showing on your my.harvard portal will be those from this current school year. Taxes Can I send my tax returns directly to you? IDOC is the best method for sending us documents, and is required for all US tax returns. IDOC is available to all students who submit a CSS Profile, whether residing in the US or abroad. Those students were unable to file a CSS Profile and who requested alternate instructions may send their foreign tax returns directly to us by mail or fax as directed by our alternate instructions. Please be sure that anything you send directly to us includes your full applicant name, applicant year, and some other unique identifier (school, birth date, etc.) What if my country doesn't have a tax return? You should send any documentation they do have. Many families will send a year-end wage statement, or a letter from each employer stating annual compensation. What if my parents are unemployed or did not file a tax return? If your parents are not required to file a federal or national tax return, they should send a signed statement listing all sources and annual amounts of income for their household. Each non-filer must print and complete a tax non-filer statement and submit it to IDOC with the rest of your application materials. IDOC also has a built-in tax non-filer statement that you are welcome to use to indicate that you or a parent did not file a tax return. What should I do if my parents or I will be requesting an extension for filing their federal taxes? For prospective students, we will be happy to accept your completed application for financial aid whenever it arrives. We do ask, however, that you send your 2022 tax returns to IDOC as soon as possible after they become available. You should not submit 2021 documents unless you are specifically asked for them. If you receive a positive admissions decision and still have not been able to send your 2022 tax returns, please be in touch with us after you receive your admissions decision. For current students, please send a copy of the IRS extension application to IDOC with the rest of your application materials. Please note that we will be unable to calculate your financial aid award until we receive the actual 2022 tax return. Other What are travel and personal expense allowances? Travel: An allowance toward the cost of traveling to and from Harvard has been included in your budget on your award letter and used in calculating your eligibility for financial aid. You are responsible for booking and paying for your own travel. Many students will use the money they earn over the summer to meet the costs of travel to and from Harvard. Personal Expenses: The estimated cost for books, supplies, clothing, laundry, telephone, entertainment, local transportation, and other incidentals has been included in the personal expenses portion of your budget. Students generally spend between $600-$800 on books over the course of both semesters. You are responsible for paying your own personal expenses. Many of the students will use money earned at their term-time jobs to cover personal expenses. Do my financial aid documents have to be in English? We require English translation for all financial aid documents. Documents do not, however, need to be translated by an official translator. Most students will save the cost of paying a translator and simply write the translation directly on the documents themselves. What should I do if my permanent address changes? Please email us and inform us of your new address. You will also need to file a change of address with the Student Data Office in the Office of the Registrar. I am undocumented. Am I still eligible for financial aid? Yes. If you are undocumented you are eligible for financial aid from Harvard. Harvard makes no distinction based on citizenship in the financial aid process or in the amount of aid for which students are eligible. Undocumented students do not need to file a FAFSA since they are not eligible to apply for federal aid. Financial aid application instructions for all students, regardless of citizenship status, can be found here . What should I do if I am returning from a leave of absence? Please notify our office if you are returning from a leave of absence. The same instructions and deadlines apply, regardless of whether you intend to return in the fall or spring semester. Make sure that you are current with loan repayments and that you file the necessary deferment or forbearance forms when you register. You may want to check the status of your student loans by calling the Student Loan Office at (617) 495-3782. In addition, your term bill from previous semesters must be paid in full. What happens if my financial aid application is late? Prospective students: Our deadlines are in place in order to ensure that we can send an aid award with our admissions decisions. We do not stop accepting applications, and a late application has no effect on your eligibility or the amount of your award. If we receive application materials late, you may simply receive your aid letter at a later date than your admission letter. Current students: Our deadlines are in place in order to ensure we have time to process your financial aid application in time for aid to be reflected on your term bill. If we receive application materials late, you may have to wait longer to receive your financial aid decision and may need to make plans to cover your first term bill payment. While a late application has no effect on the amount of your award, we typically expect all applications to be submitted no later than August 1. Do I need to apply for a state scholarship? Yes, if you are a resident of CT, VT, or DC, you must submit the supplemental state grant application to the appropriate agency. Students who are eligible for state grant funds but fail to follow the procedures and deadlines set by their state grant programs will not receive additional Harvard financial aid to cover lost funding. Are deferred students still eligible for financial aid? Yes. You are considered for financial aid no matter when you are admitted. Is there financial aid available for foreign students? Yes, on exactly the same basis as for American students. Although foreign students are not eligible for any federal funding, the College has its own job and scholarship money available to foreign students. How will I know if my financial aid application is incomplete? For prospective students, we cannot verify receipt of any information until after a student is admitted, and materials will not show up on your Admissions Applicant Status Portal (this portal tracks only required admissions documents). If you are missing financial aid materials at the time of admission, we will notify you immediately. Current students can check their my.harvard.edu account where information is updated daily. Does Harvard participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program and/or ROTC? Harvard University is proud to help veterans continue their education by participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program . As a part of the University, the Harvard College Griffin Financial Aid Office administers Yellow Ribbon Funds for its eligible undergraduate students, who will receive a matching amount from the College. Eligibility for the Yellow Ribbon Program is determined by the Veterans Affairs Administration and not by Harvard College. Students interested in ROTC opportunities, please visit the following service websites: Army ROTC Air Force ROTC website. Navy ROTC When will I find out about my financial aid award? If you are a prospective student and completed your application by the deadline, then you will receive an award decision in your acceptance mailing. If you missed the application deadline, an award decision will be completed as soon as possible and in the order it is received. If you are a current student, award decisions will be posted to your my.harvard account around July 1st. If you missed the application deadline, an award decision will be completed during the remainder of the summer and in the order it is received. Does applying for financial aid affect my chances for admission? No. Your financial circumstances are never an impediment to admission. Foreign students have the same access to financial aid funding as do U.S. citizens. What is the deadline for applying for financial aid? Prospective Students: November 1st, for Restrictive Early Action candidates. February 1st, for Regular Decision candidates. March 1st, for Transfer candidates. Current Students: May 1st. Is it easy to qualify for financial aid at Harvard? Once you are admitted to Harvard, we work closely with your family to ensure you can afford to come here. Because we seek the best students regardless of their ability to pay, we are committed to meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need for all four years.  See how affordable Harvard can be with our Net Price Calculator . What can I do if my family's financial situation is complicated? Submit a letter of special circumstance to IDOC along with the rest of your financial aid application materials. Will Harvard provide travel expenses for international students who receive financial aid? All students, American and international, who are on financial aid have a travel allowance included in their financial aid award to help cover the cost of travel to and from Cambridge. Overseas students are advised to seek information from the nearest U.S. Cultural Affairs Office about travel grants and other financial assistance available to qualified students from various foundations and from the U.S. government. What if I am interested only in applying for federal loans (Stafford and PLUS)? If you do not intend to apply for need-based grant aid from Harvard but do want to apply for a Federal student or parent loan, please notify us of your intentions and submit only the FAFSA. Once we receive your FAFSA information electronically from the Department of Education, our office will notify you of your loan eligibility. How do you determine eligibility for Harvard Scholarships? We determine your financial aid award based solely on your family's demonstrated financial need. Our program is designed to help families across the economic spectrum, from low to upper-middle incomes. Aid is completely need-based and considers many factors, such as your family's income, assets, size, and unusual expenses. There are no merit-based awards, and we have no preferential packaging policies that give some students more attractive awards than others. Can I email you my documents? No. The Griffin Financial Aid Office cannot accept any documents over email. Please submit all documents as described on our application instructions . Are there any merit-based financial aid awards at Harvard? No, we admit students based on their strengths and talents, but all Harvard-administered aid is based only on financial need, and we treat all admitted students equally in terms of their eligibility for that aid. How can I track material that I’ve sent your office? For prospective students, given the tremendous volume of material sent to our office , we are unable to confirm receipt. Rest assured that if we discover we are missing necessary financial aid application materials or have any questions we will be in contact with you (by email or phone) after the student is admitted. Current and admitted students can always check the status of their application on my.harvard . Study Abroad Financial Aid Preparing To Go Abroad What happens if my program’s estimates differ from the standard amounts? You can provide that information on your Study Abroad Supplement for review by the Financial Aid Office. Is it more expensive to study abroad? Since we use the same expected family contribution whether you are studying at Harvard or abroad, the cost to your family should be the same in both cases. However, if a budget is more than $5,000 above your Harvard standard budget, the costs in excess of that $5,000 threshold will not be eligible for additional scholarship funding. A subsidized loan will usually be available to meet these additional expenses. If while abroad you find that your necessary living expenses are substantially higher than anticipated, please contact your financial aid officer. You may be eligible for additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help meet these expenses. It is to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before using credit cards to meet unanticipated expenses. If you are worried that you do not have resources to fall back upon in the case of urgent expenses while abroad, or to allow you to take advantage of discretionary travel or cultural opportunities that may come up, we may be able to offer you an “unexpected expenses loan” in advance of your departure. This is a subsidized loan that you can take out for your time abroad. If you don’t end up using the loan funds while abroad, you can simply return them when you return. Interest on these funds does not begin to accrue until 6 months after graduation/withdrawal, so they may be a much better option than credit cards to help you manage expenses. How do you determine my study abroad personal expenses allowance? The personal expenses allowance of your budget is meant to help toward your daily living expenses (separate from your housing and food charges) while enrolled in your study abroad program. As expenses can vary greatly based on each student’s discretion, we are not able to meet every student’s individual expenses. Rather, we build an allowance toward them in your budget, but leave the daily choices to you. For instance, in regard to local travel expenses, we might be able to offer you financial aid toward commuting from your apartment to your school campus, but we wouldn’t be able to offer you scholarship toward a traveling tour that is separate from your program. However, we recognize that you may want to take advantage of your time away from Cambridge, and we encourage you to make your time abroad enriching and educational in the broadest sense. We may be able to offer you subsidized loan to help you expand the scope of your experience abroad, and allow you a wider range of choices. Do I have to pay for health insurance when I’m abroad? Is that the same thing as the Health Services Fee? Please be aware that it is your responsibility to make sure that you have the appropriate health insurance coverage, whether you are studying on campus or abroad. All students are required to have health insurance, and the Harvard Blue Cross/ Blue Shield health insurance is automatically charged to each student’s termbill at the beginning of each semester. If you are covered under your family’s health insurance policy, you may be eligible to waive the Harvard health insurance. It is your responsibility to pursue the health insurance waiver, and University Health Services can help you with that decision. The Health Fee and the Student Services Fee are the two mandatory Harvard fees, and are automatically charged to each student’s termbill at the beginning of each semester. You continue to be responsible for the Student Services Fee while abroad, and we include it in your budget. However, students who are studying abroad are usually eligible to waive the Health Fee. It is your responsibility to pursue the Health Fee waiver, and you should contact University Health Services about the Health Fee waiver. When will I find out how much aid I will receive for my study abroad? If you are applying for the fall semester or the full year, you will be notified at the same time you get your award letter for academic year provided you turned in your Study Abroad Supplement by the deadline. If you are applying for the spring semester, you will be notified in early December. How do I know if I need to submit a Consortium Agreement? You will need to get a Consortium Agreement completed if you are attending a program affiliated with a U.S. college or university. Please have this form completed as soon as possible before you go abroad. You do not need this form if you are going on a Harvard program or direct enrolling abroad. What should I do if I am planning to Study Abroad for academic credit for part or all of next year? Please contact our office to determine your budget. Instructions and deadlines are here . What happens with the monthly Harvard Student Billing Statement? All your financial aid will be disbursed to your Harvard termbill, and we will release your financial aid from your termbill directly to you. Your Harvard statement may take a few months to reconcile. Normally, you will not need to make any payments to Harvard while you are studying abroad unless you are being billed for a Harvard-sponsored program, or if your financial aid does not cover your Harvard Student Services Fee. What if I have questions about budgeting? The Office of International Education holds drop-in hours and meetings with staff or a student adviser to help students explore their study abroad options and will be able to help you in thinking about your budget. For more information, please contact the OIE ( oie@fas.harvard.edu ). For additional assistance with budgeting questions, please email or call the Financial Aid Office and a financial aid officer will be happy to assist you or help you schedule an appointment. Who receives the bill from the study abroad program? The programs will send the bill to you or your family. Am I eligible to use financial aid for study abroad? If you are receiving financial aid and are approved for academic credit during the academic year at another institution, your aid should be available to help cover your costs. The Office of International Education (OIE) determines your program is eligible for academic credit, and the Financial Aid Office (FAO) will work with you to determine the amount of aid you are eligible to receive for your study. What should I do if my program requires that I make a deposit prior to when my financial aid would ordinarily be disbursed? Does financial aid cover my air travel? Usually, the family will pay the deposit and purchase the plane ticket as a part of the family contribution towards educational costs. If you have high financial need or if most of your educational costs are being met with financial aid, then you should contact your financial aid officer. We will work with you either to waive or reduce the deposit, or possibly pay it as necessary. We also may release funds to help you purchase your plane ticket. How do I notify the Financial Aid Office about my plans to study abroad? Complete the Study Abroad Supplement and return it, along with all supporting documents substantiating your budget, to the FAO. If you are planning to study abroad in the fall semester or for the full academic year, the form is due May 1st. If you are planning to study in the spring semester, the form is due October 30th. Be sure to attach documentation of your program budget to the Supplement. Please submit the Supplement by these deadlines, even if you do not know all the answers to the questions, as you can always update it later. Can I use financial aid to study abroad during the summer? Harvard’s financial aid program is only available for term-time for-credit study. Funding for summer experiences is available from a wide variety of offices and programs at Harvard. Good places to start include the Mignone Center for Career Success , the CARAT funding sources database , and the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships . How does the Financial Aid Office determine my study abroad budget? As with your Harvard budget, your study abroad budget will include a combination of billed and non-billed costs. We construct the budget from the program information that you submit on your Supplement, and these costs will include tuition and fees, room and board, and a standard allowance for personal expenses and books. In addition, we will include a standard allowance for air travel to the area of the world in which you will be studying and will include any additional non-discretionary expenses (e.g. visa/passport costs, medical expenses for required shots) that are specific to your program. Lastly, you will continue to be billed for the Harvard Student Services Fee during the semester(s) that you are abroad, so this will be built into your budget. While You Are Abroad What happens if I have questions or problems while I am abroad? We want you to have an enjoyable and enriching study abroad experience. Although you may be very far away from Cambridge, the Financial Aid Office is still here as a resource to you, and we hope that you will be in touch with our office if we can be of any help to you. What happens to my loans while I study abroad? While studying full-time and working towards your degree, your loans should not go into repayment. If they do, you need to provide written enrollment verification directly from your program either to the Federal Government (for your Direct Loan) or to Harvard (for your Perkins and/or Harvard Loans). You can download the deferment forms from the Student Loan Office . Do not ignore these notices or your loans may go into default. How much financial aid will be sent to the program and how much to me? The Financial Aid Office takes the anticipated financial aid for the semester(s) and subtracts any balance due to your Harvard term bill, including any back balance from the previous semester. The remaining amount will be refunded to you and you will be expected to make payments to the study abroad program as required. What if I feel like my living expenses are higher than were anticipated? We encourage you to email your financial aid officer. While we do our best to construct an appropriate budget for you in advance based on the information provided by your program, we recognize that you may encounter higher costs during your time abroad. It is definitely to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before relying on credit cards to help meet the difference in your expenses. We may be able to offer you additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help with these unanticipated costs. International Students Testing Do I have to take the TOEFL? A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. First-year and transfer applicants are not required to take an English proficiency exam, but you may submit scores if you wish to do so. Visiting Undergraduate Students program applicants are required to take the TOEFL. Process Are there quotas for international applicants? There are no quotas or limits of any kind at any point in the admissions process. All students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the secondary school they attend. A student's chances for admission and financial aid are not affected by citizenship or by the location of the school that the student attends. Does Harvard offer admission application fee waivers to international students? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver directly through the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, if you meet their respective indicators of economic need. If you do not meet these indicators, please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived . Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way. Is there an interview for international applicants? When possible, we try to arrange for you to meet with alumni/ae in or near your school communities. You will not be at a disadvantage if an interview cannot be arranged. In the U.S., Canada and the U.K., an alumnus/a will contact an applicant directly by phone, e-mail, or letter if such an interview is possible. If you live outside these areas, we aim to hold an admission interview when and where possible. Our interviewers abroad are graduates of Harvard who offer their assistance on a volunteer basis. While we try to make interviewers as widely available as possible, it will not always be possible for a student to have an interview. The absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. See more about international interviews . How do international students apply? The application requirements are the same for all applicants whether a student attends high school inside or outside the U.S. All first-year candidates must complete the Common Application or the Coalition Application along with the required supplements. We have no preference and each application is treated equally by the Admissions Committee. View our detailed application requirements here . Transfer Admissions Criteria How do I know if I am competitive/ How hard is it to get in as a transfer student? The Harvard College Transfer Admissions Committee evaluates the whole person throughout the application process. There is not a required minimum grade point average (GPA) or test score to apply. The transfer admissions pool is very competitive. In recent years, we have admitted 12-16 students from a pool of over 1,500 applicants. The committee looks for a clearly defined academic need to transfer, a proven record of high achievement, and strong faculty recommendations. Testing I am a non-traditional student. Am I still required to submit a standardized test? What about my high school transcript? The SAT or ACT is required of all transfer applicants. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions If you have applied to Harvard in the past, we will have access to your previous application in our review process including any scores that you submitted with earlier applications. Test scores can be particularly helpful for non-traditional students. We encourage non-traditional students to submit an exam taken within three years of applying for transfer to reflect current academic ability. Self-reported scores are acceptable during the application process; official scores are required of enrolling students. High school transcripts are a required component of the transfer application. If you are unable to obtain your high school transcript, please submit a letter from your high school explaining why the transcript is not available. I applied to Harvard in the past and submitted test scores with my previous application. Do I need to submit test scores again? If I don't report my scores on my current transfer application, will you consider my application without testing? To streamline your application review, we request that students who have taken the SAT or ACT report their scores with each new application, even if you have applied to us previously. Self-reported scores are acceptable during the application process; official scores are required of enrolling students. Please bear in mind that we will consider prior scores, and any other information that we have previously received on your behalf, in our whole-person review process. If you have applied to Harvard in the past with test scores and choose not to report them on your current application, we will have access to your previous application in our review process including any scores that you submitted with earlier applications.

Housing Is there housing for transfer students on campus? Yes. Admitted transfer students who indicate in their application that they wish to live on campus are eligible for housing in the undergraduate Houses. Students are not required to live on campus, though nearly all undergraduate students do. The undergraduate Houses do not have appropriate accommodations for students who will be living with a spouse, partner, or other family members; students in these situations should plan to live off campus and will be given information about housing resources if admitted. How are transfer students supported on campus? Enrolling students take part in a fall orientation program and are connected with a dedicated transfer adviser who helps with academic planning and the transition to Harvard life. Transfer students who live on-campus will find strong community in their undergraduate Houses, and students who live off campus will benefit from the Dudley Community. Transfer students are also supported by peer advisers , who were themselves transfer students from prior years. Process How long does it take for application materials I have submitted to appear as received in my transfer application status? Application material processing can take up to three weeks if submitted by mail. This does not affect the March 1st deadline, so long as your materials were submitted (or postmarked) by March 1st. May I apply for both Transfer Admission and for the Visiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) Program at the same time? No. Applicants may apply to only one program per admissions cycle. When can I apply as a transfer student? Students may apply to enter as a sophomore (2nd year) or junior (3rd year) student. Harvard College does not admit students for the spring semester. All transfer applications each year are due by March 1st to enter the fall term of the same calendar year. Transfer applicants who are admitted are not permitted to defer their admission. What courses transfer to Harvard College? Is there a list of transferrable courses? The Harvard College Registrar's Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. The admissions office does not keep a list of transferrable courses and cannot advise on this matter during the application process. Harvard College typically accepts courses taken while enrolled as a full-time student in an undergraduate program similar to our liberal arts curriculum. The Committee also looks for strong preparation in the student's expected field of specialization. I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me? The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here . Are there interviews for transfer applicants? Generally, we do not conduct interviews for transfer applicants. Should the Admissions Committee need more information regarding your application, our office will contact you. Transfer students may not schedule or request their own interviews. How do I know if you received my transfer application materials? Once your application has been received and processed, our office will send a confirmation email with a link to the Applicant Portal . The application status portal will allow you to track your required materials as they are merged with your application. Our office is unable to confirm receipt of materials via phone or by email. Our office is also unable to return any application materials submitted. Financial Aid Do transfer students qualify for financial aid? Yes. All transfer applicants, including international students, are eligible to apply for need-based financial aid. Transfer applicants should follow the prospective student financial aid application instructions. Veterans Admissions US Military Veterans Is there a separate or different admissions process for military veterans? There is no separate or different admissions process for applicants who are or will be veterans. Applicants with less than one year of college credit may apply as first-year students and those with between one and two years of college credit may apply as transfer students. Please visit the U.S. Military Veterans page to learn more about admissions and financial aid. I am a US military veteran. Should I apply as a first-year or transfer student? To be eligible to transfer to Harvard College, you must have satisfactorily completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college by your anticipated date of matriculation at Harvard, and not have completed more than two years total in college. Please note that once a student has completed more than two years of college coursework at another institution, regardless of the courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission or freshman admission. Our office cannot make exceptions to this policy as it is set by the Harvard faculty. If you do not meet the above requirements and have not yet completed one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, then you may apply for freshman admission to Harvard College. Please note that if you are eligible to apply as a freshman that any college coursework you have completed would not transfer to Harvard College. My high school files no longer exist because the school closed or was destroyed by a fire/storm/war. What are my options? In order to process your application, we will need to be able to verify your graduation. Therefore, you may want to reach out to the district or state level agency that manages educational records. They may be able to provide proof of graduation or other documents. In addition, since the armed forces require a high school diploma or GED to enlist, they may be able to assist you in confirming your graduation status. Does Harvard accept credit earned from classes taken during my time in the military? Military-specific coursework or credits earned via military training and service, including courses appearing on Joint Services Transcripts, are not generally accepted for transfer credit at Harvard. Online courses are also not generally eligible for transfer credit. Only courses that are liberal arts in nature (in fields comparable to those offered at Harvard College), and that were taken in person while enrolled as a full-time college student, can be considered for transfer credit. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Office evaluates transcripts for all admitted transfer students to determine course transferability once a student has been admitted. As a military veteran, my high school grades do not reflect my current work ethic and commitment to my studies. How does this impact my application? We consider an applicant’s full range of experiences and growth from those experiences, especially for veterans. A weak high school transcript does not necessarily mean you will not be a compelling candidate for Harvard. Look at your high school transcript with a critical eye, identify what your weaknesses in the classroom might have been and think about what you have done since that time to address those weaknesses. Be prepared to explain any steps you have taken to improve. I took college or community college courses before/during my time in the military. Am I eligible to apply as a transfer student? To be eligible to transfer to Harvard College, you must have satisfactorily completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college by your anticipated date of matriculation at Harvard, and not have completed more than two years total in college. Once a student has completed more than two years of college coursework at another institution, regardless of the courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission to Harvard. Our office cannot make exceptions to this policy as it is set by the Harvard faculty. We recognize that military service may impact a student’s access to classes. Please contact us at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu if you have specific questions about your situation. I have been away from school for a while during my military service. Do I still need to submit letters of recommendation? We fully understand that high school teachers may not remember you or still be at your school. We normally suggest that you get a similar set of letters from people who know you well in your current phase of life, such as commanding officers or other professors/instructors (if you have pursued any coursework since high school). Helpful letters might address how you dealt with adversity, stress, or other challenges, how you got along with your peers and how you have maximized opportunities available to you – all critical components to success at Harvard and beyond. How can I interview if I am unable to leave my military base or am deployed at sea? Interviews are not required for admission. If you are contacted for an interview and are not able to leave base, please call our office (617-495-1551) so that we may assist. If you are applying as a transfer student, please know that interviews are not routinely offered to transfer applicants. In cases where it is difficult to reach an applicant we may request a phone or Skype interview. Is it possible to enroll at Harvard College and complete my coursework remotely while remaining on active duty? Harvard College does not presently offer an option to work toward a degree remotely. Harvard Extension School offers more flexible options for students seeking opportunities to study remotely. Learn more about the Extension School's undergraduate degrees . I have never taken the SAT or ACT, or I have not taken the SAT or ACT in recent years and cannot because I’ve been on active duty, what do I do? Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions Veterans Financial Aid Is the financial aid application process the same for a veteran as it is for a non-veteran student? Yes. All aid applicants should follow the same set of application instructions . Harvard College acknowledges the unique contributions each admitted student brings to our learning community. We are therefore committed to equitable treatment through one comprehensive need-based financial aid program. When a veteran completes the FAFSA, the Federal Government may categorize that student as an “independent student.”  Why is Harvard College requesting financial information for parent(s) if the Federal Government considers the student \"independent?\" A student may be deemed \"independent\" for federal purposes for a variety of reasons, including having veteran status. Harvard College maintains its own financial aid program and policies, and it is our institutional philosophy that every student’s parents have a responsibility to contribute to their child’s educational expenses. We therefore begin by asking all aid applicants to provide information for both parents. However, we are committed to working with any student on an individual basis to learn more about complex, unusual, or challenging circumstances that are not easily described in the standard aid application. If any aid applicant cannot ask one or both of their parents to participate in the financial aid process, the applicant should complete the Parent Information Sheet and submit it as part of their financial aid application. How can a veteran report unusual circumstances as a part of their financial aid application (such as unusual debts, liabilities, or anything else that may not be captured by the application)? There are many avenues to provide more information on your specific financial circumstances. When completing the CSS Profile, there is a dedicated section that allows any applicant to expand upon their specific situation. Applicants may also upload a brief “special circumstances” letter through IDOC when they are submitting their tax documents. In addition, all applicants are encouraged to contact the Griffin Financial Aid Office and work with one of our Financial Aid Officers, both during the application process and throughout their time at Harvard, to discuss their circumstances. Would a veteran be eligible for additional financial aid if they have unusually high expenses due to living off-campus? While the Griffin Financial Aid Office is limited to providing aid for education-related expenses, we want to be sure to understand each student’s circumstances as fully as possible. Students who have non-traditional housing needs, such as dependent minors in the family, may submit a detailed monthly budget outlining their off-campus costs for the Financial Aid Committee to review. If a student has VA Benefits that they will use while attending Harvard College, what does that process look like? The Griffin Financial Aid Office works in conjunction with Harvard University Student Financial Services (SFS) to complete the certification process for any student who elects to use VA benefits.  An outline of the process can be found here , and there is also a helpful “VA and Military FAQs” page on the SFS website here . Once a student has obtained their Certificate of Eligibility, we would ask them to contact our office at faoinfo@fas.harvard.edu for information on next steps. In general, we encourage students to contact our office directly if they have specific questions about how their VA benefits might interact with financial aid. Is Harvard College a Yellow Ribbon Institution?  Does Harvard put a cap on the number of students who can receive the Yellow Ribbon funds? Harvard College is proud to be a Yellow Ribbon institution. We do not place a cap on the number of students who receive Yellow Ribbon funds. Student Life and Support Does Harvard have any student groups or alumni groups for veterans? Yes, Harvard College offers both student and alumni groups for veterans. Please visit the Harvard Undergraduate Veterans Organization for information about our student group and Harvard Veterans for information about our alumni group. Do students who are veterans have to live on campus? No, while Harvard College is predominantly residential, some students do not live in College housing. Undergraduates living off campus may elect to be members of Dudley Community. This option has appealed to a number of students, including married students and students who wish to be part of a fully non-residential community. Students who are part of Dudley Community are eligible for meal contracts in Dudley Community and are included in all social and cultural activities sponsored by the Community. They are \"deaned\" by the Allston Burr Resident Dean of Dudley Community and are advised for purposes of fellowship and professional school application by Dudley Community tutors. Visiting Undergraduate Students VUS Admissions What is a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS)? Students currently enrolled full-time at an accredited college or university may apply to spend one or two semesters studying at Harvard College. After completing their time at Harvard, the students return to their home school, where Harvard credits are generally accepted, to complete their degree. Am I eligible to become a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS)? If you are currently enrolled full-time at an accredited college or university you may apply to spend one or two semesters studying at Harvard College. This program is not for high school graduates who wish to study at Harvard for a gap year. Additionally, since the VUS Program is for full-time undergraduate students only, if you have already achieved the equivalent of a bachelor's degree, you would not be eligible. However, you might be eligible to be a \"Special Student\" at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. For more information on this program, please visit their website . Are standardized tests required as part of the Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS) Application? Students whose native language is not English are REQUIRED to submit a TOEFL score not more than two years old. The results of this test are very useful to the Committee as it considers international applicants. Official tests results must be submitted electronically to the Admissions Office from the ETS (code#3434). We do not require SAT, ACT or AP scores to be submitted in order to apply to the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. However, we encourage students who have taken them to submit their scores, because all information about a candidate is helpful in the admissions process. I am from another country but I speak English proficiently. Do I still need to take the TOEFL? Only applicants to the Visiting Undergraduate Students program are required to submit the TOEFL. It is not a requirement for first-year and transfer applicants. Without all of the information about a VUS candidate, we cannot make exceptions to this requirement and time constraints do not allow us to pre-screen all applicants to determine if they are exempt from taking the TOEFL. Therefore, we advise all VUS applicants whose native language is not English to take the TOEFL and submit the results. Is there a minimum TOEFL score required for the VUS program? While there is no absolute test score cut-off, the Committee would be concerned that an internet based TOEFL score below 100 might indicate that the candidate does not have sufficient fluency in English to do well in classes here. A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. Are visiting undergraduate students eligible for Harvard housing? Visiting undergraduate students are not offered University housing. Accepted students must find their own housing before they arrive in Cambridge. Is there financial aid for visiting undergraduate students? As a Visiting Undergraduate Student, you will not be eligible for Harvard financial aid and you must secure your own funding. When should I apply for the VUS program? Fall Term of Full academic year Application opens: February 1 Application deadline: April 1 Spring Term 2024 Application opens: July 1 Application deadline: September 1 It is advised that you apply for the appropriate term. Additionally, we are not able to make early admission decisions for students who wish to apply for a later term. Do Visiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) have the same privileges as Harvard Degree Candidates? While VUS are not degree candidates and do not receive a diploma from Harvard College, they have access to all libraries, academic, and athletic facilities just like Harvard degree candidates. VUS are affiliated with the Dudley Community, the Harvard Community for students who live off campus.

Helpful Links FAQs Applicant Portal Events Contact Us my.harvard Messages to Parents & Families Breadcrumb Home - About Supreme Court Decision June 29th, 2023 I urge you to read the joint statement that was issued this morning in response to the Supreme Court decision handed down today Welcome Home August 19th, 2021 I am looking forward to welcoming you and your student to Harvard College in the coming days. Hundreds of deeply committed faculty members, administrators, and College staff have worked hard to ensure our community is ready for our full return to campus life. FAS Fall 2021 Planning Update March 22nd, 2021 I am writing to share Dean Gay's message announcing that Harvard College expects a full return to campus for the Fall 2021 semester. Beginning the Spring Together January 26th, 2021 I hope that your new year is off to a good start, and that you are staying healthy. I am writing today to share a message which was sent to our students earlier today as we begin the spring semester together. Our Common Project January 21st, 2021 I write to share Dean Gay’s important letter to the faculty and staff from earlier today. While I was inspired by the words and performances during yesterday’s inauguration, especially those written by our own Amanda Gorman ’20, I was also painfully aware, as I’m sure you were, that it was occurring against the backdrop of the horrific events of January 6th. And it was difficult to face the fact that the lights illuminated around the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool marked the enormous loss of 400,000 lives to the pandemic in this country. Looking Forward to Spring Semester January 11th, 2021 I hope you are doing well and staying healthy during these difficult times. By now, you may have seen a message from University leaders earlier today noting the continued surge in COVID-19 cases. We continue to closely monitor the circumstances to ensure that we are doing everything we can to keep our community healthy. Reflections December 18th, 2020 As we approach the end of a year unlike any we could have ever imagined, there is simply no way that I can adequately express my gratitude for each and every one of you, and the partnership we have had during this extraordinarily challenging time. Spring Term and Panel Discussion Invite December 1st, 2020 By now, you have likely seen the message from President Bacow, Dean Gay and me sent earlier today regarding plans for the Spring 2021 term. Below you will find key points from the message, as well as an invitation to a panel discussion tomorrow (Wednesday, December 2nd) at 7:00 PM EST. So Much To Be Thankful For November 25th, 2020 Each year as I gather with family on Thanksgiving, one of the things I am most grateful for is the partnership of our students’ family and friends. Without your help and support, building this extraordinary community would never be possible.
