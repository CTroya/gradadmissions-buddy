Request an Application Fee Waiver based on Previous Denied Application within One Year Applicants who have previously applied and been denied admission may request to have their application considered again for another start term, and the application fee waived for one additional application, if within one year of the original application . Contact the Office of Engineering Graduate Admissions to request the fee waiver based on this reason. Applicants cannot maintain multiple application accounts and will be required to provide their original application reference number, application account email, and full name. Applicants may start a new application or request a one-time offer for admissions to create a duplicate copy of the original denied application, waive the application fee, and mark the application as un-submitted. The applicant is then responsible for updating any materials (resume, statement of purpose, transcripts, self-reported test scores, letters of recommendation) and submitting their application by the program’s specified deadline for the new start term. Please be aware, applications will be reviewed after the next application deadline, during the normal review period for each program. We recommend applicants wait until closer to the start term’s deadline to update materials and submit application, regardless of when the application is duplicated. 2024 Admissions Cycle Our 2024 admissions cycle begins August 15, 2023, for all 2024 start terms (spring, summer, fall). Previously denied applicants may contact us after August 21, 2023 , should you choose to apply again and would like to request a one-time fee waiver and/or duplication of original application. Transcripts Applicants are required to provide unofficial transcripts for application review. If a university-provided unofficial transcript is not available, contact our office for assistance by email: [email protected] . Unofficial Transcripts Unofficial transcripts must be added directly in the application under the “Academic History” section. Include all colleges and universities you have attended, starting with the school(s) where a bachelor’s degree was earned, followed by all other schools with a period of enrollment. If you are earning dual bachelor’s degrees from two schools, you must enter both schools and degrees separately and include unofficial transcripts from each school. List the expected “Degree” and “Date Conferred or Expected” for the school where you earned (or will earn) your bachelor’s degree. Only use the “No Degree Awarded or Expected” option if you will not complete a degree at that school. If you have listed more than one degree or period of enrollment at a single institution, you must upload an unofficial transcript for each entry. Updated Unofficial Transcripts – Not Accepted for Application Review We do not accept updated unofficial transcripts after your application has been submitted. Many applicants apply with partial or “incomplete” transcripts while in the process of completing a degree; programs are aware of this, utilize a holistic review of all materials submitted, and do not require updated transcripts. Official Transcripts – Not Accepted for Application Review Do not send official transcripts directly from your school or a third-party vendor for application review. Official transcripts are only required by admitted students at the time of enrollment and must include degree conferral. Newly admitted students should reference Submitting Final Documents for details. Certified Translations and Credential Evaluations The Office of Engineering Graduate Admissions requires literal, certified translations for all documents issued in a language other than English. For all foreign academic work, we strongly recommend, but do not require, that you submit a professional credential evaluation from World Education Services (WES). We recommend the WES ICAP course by course evaluation. Visit Information for International Students for detailed information on Certified Translations and Credential Evaluations. Bachelor’s Degree Completion All graduate applicants applying to the Whiting School of Engineering are required to have completed a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent prior to beginning our graduate program. We do not distinguish between a 3-year or 4-year degree. Admitted students will be required to submit final official transcripts with degree conferral by the end of their first term enrolled.

Play background animation Pause background animation Application Materials Can I submit copies of transcripts? You will be required to upload a copy of your transcript into your admissions portal, but an official transcript will be requested if you are admitted to the program. When it is received, you will be enrolled. What is the application fee? A $75 fee is typically required alongside your application, but we do offer waivers. If you are a first-generation college student, have participated in a program such as NNE or SACNAS ( among many others ), or are unable to apply because of the fee, please contact us at admissions@cs.jhu.edu . How many letters of recommendation do I need? The MSE application requires two letters of recommendation. Your recommenders will submit their recommendations via the online application. Can my letters of recommendation come from contacts outside of academia? If you have worked for several years, it is expected that some of your recommendations will come from non-academic sources. What should be avoided is having mostly non-academic recommendations when your last several years have been in academia, and vice versa. Can I have recommenders send letters by fax or email? We require the use of the online application recommendation section for recommenders’ submissions. Choosing this option in the application will trigger an email to your recommender with explicit instructions on how to submit their recommendation. Do you require that your official form be used for letters of recommendation? The official form is a part of the online recommendation. Comments will be accepted even if the official form is not used. However, we strongly encourage the form to be used because it includes a table that provides us with additional information. ETS, GRE, and TOEFL Exams What are the institution/department codes for the GRE and TOEFL exams? Our institution code is (4655) for the GRE and (C559) for the TOEFL exam. Our department code is (0402) for the GRE and (78) for the TOEFL exam. How do I find out where I can take the GRE exam? The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is the world’s most widely used admissions test for graduate and professional schools. Visit the Education Testing Service (ETS) website to view current updates for testing available in your country. What are the departmental requirements for the GRE exams? The Whiting School of Engineering requires GRE General Test scores for applications to all master’s programs. However, the Department of Computer Science does not review the scores nor do they have any impact on the outcome of its decision during the application review process. UPDATE: Effective for the Fall 2024 term only applicants to the MSE CS program are not required to submit GRE scores. It is an optional material to submit with your application. What are the departmental requirements for the TOEFL/TWE exams? All non-native English speakers must take either the TOEFL or IELTS exam. Neither the TWE nor the TSE is required, but it is recommended. Requirements: TOEFL: 100 or above IELTS: 7 or above Do you accept the IELTS test? The Department of Computer Science does accept IELTS. Can I submit copies of GRE or TOEFL score reports with my application and avoid the fees ETS charges? Copies will be accepted, although it is best to have your GRE scores sent through ETS . Applicants should request recent GRE scores from ETS and submit them to Johns Hopkins University before the application deadline. In order for your application to be reviewed, you must include the university’s institution code in your request to ETS . The Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering’s institution code is 4655. TOEFL results should be sent directly to the Engineering Graduate Admissions Office by either the IELTS Global Recognition System or ETS, which also administers TOEFL. If admitted, you will be required to submit your official final documents directly to the WSE Graduate Admissions Office. How long ago can I have taken the GRE or TOEFL for the scores to still be acceptable? The scores must be new enough that ETS still considers them valid and will provide an official score report. Currently, the ETS sets this limit at five years. TOEFL exam scores are valid for two years from your test date. Is there a minimum score required on the TOEFL or IELTS exam in order to apply for the MSE program? The minimum scores are as follows: TOEFL: 100 or above IELTS: 7 or above Getting Accepted What do you look for in letters of recommendation? First, we consider the source of the letter. A letter from your cousin who happens to teach at a two-year college is weighed significantly less than a letter from a researcher at a top computer science school! Next, we look for evidence of research potential. In particular, evidence of outstanding performance in past projects is of high importance. Somewhat less important is evidence of outstanding ability in the classroom. A good recommender should know you well and be able to rank you very favorably in comparison with your peers. Do you look at my transcripts? Yes, we do. Both your grades and courses are important—primarily your grades in CS courses during your last two years of undergraduate study. How do you weigh other experience, such as research, projects, or employment? Previous research experience is the easiest way to be placed on the top of the applicant interest list. For this reason, we encourage you to send a link to detailed information on your past research experience, if applicable. Projects performed for classes, as part of a job, or on your own are also important, particularly if the projects are research-related. Make sure to include a description of these projects with your application—better yet, link to an online file. Previous teaching experience also improves your chances. What role does the statement of purpose play? Statements of purpose are very important, as they allow us to better form a picture of each applicant and convince us that you have the attitude needed to succeed in a graduate program. The Graduate Affairs and Admissions Office does not accept paper copies of statements of purpose as applicants are expected to submit this document through the online application. The uploaded file cannot exceed 500KB in size. The document must also adhere to 1-inch margins. With regards to a Sample of Work (if your department requires this or its applicants have a habit of submitting it anyway), the online application can only accept samples of work up to 500KB in size. The document must also adhere to 1-inch margins. Please do not send duplicates of documents that were successfully uploaded to the online system. Can I include extra information with my application? We encourage you to include any information that you think will help us make a more accurate assessment of your abilities. However, it is generally better to give short abstracts of papers or projects (links to online versions are even better) rather than full papers or reports. What financial aid will I receive if admitted to the MSE program? The department regrets that we are unable to give financial aid to MSE students. Once you are here, you can apply for part-time student work as a course assistant or for other types of work; however, we cannot grant tuition waivers for this work. MSE students are never given a stipend of any form, but may be hired on an hourly basis. What is the application fee? A $75 fee is typically required alongside your application. If I am admitted only to the MSE program but wish to get a PhD, what can I do? If you satisfy all the qualifying requirements for the PhD program and a professor wishes to serve as your PhD thesis advisor and secure financial support for your research, you can become a PhD candidate. You will still have to apply for admission into the program and be approved by the Admissions Committee and the Department Chair. Do you accept students from other disciplines? Entering students are expected to have completed a program of study equivalent to that required by the BS in computer science. Applicants from other disciplines are required to have coursework (or equivalent experience) in intermediate programming (C++ and Java), data structures, automata theory, computer systems fundamentals, and algorithms. I work full-time in the Baltimore area. How can I get a master’s degree through Hopkins? Full-time working professionals should apply to JHU’s Engineering for Professionals program. This is a completely separate program from the day school and offers a large number of computer science courses online, in the evening, and during the summer at several locations in the Baltimore-Washington area that lead to an MS degree or post-master’s certificate. No PhD degrees are offered online. For more information, and visit Engineering for Professionals website or email jhep@jhu.edu .

Stefano Soatto, with CLSP Amazon, UCLA Computer Vision Title: Toward Foundational Models of Physical Scenes: From Large Language Models to World Models and Back Date: September 28, 2023 Abstract: Now that a significant fraction of human knowledge has been shared through the internet, scraped and squashed into the weights of large language models, do we still need embodiment and interaction with the physical world to build representations? Is there a dichotomy between LLMs and “large world models?” What is the role of visual perception in learning such models? Can perceptual agents trained by passive observation learn world models suitable for control? To begin tackling these questions, Stefano Soatto will first address the issue of controllability of LLMs and propose a simplistic definition of “meaning” that reflects the functional characteristics of a trained LLM. He will show that a well-trained LLM establishes a topology in the space of meanings, represented by equivalence classes of the trajectories of an underlying dynamical model. Then, he will describe both necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability in such a space of meanings. He will highlight the relation between meanings induced by a trained LLM upon the set of sentences that can be uttered and “physical scenes” underlying sets of images that can be observed. Lastly, he will show that popular models ostensibly used to represent the 3D scene (neural radiance fields) can at most represent the images on which they are trained, but not the underlying physical scene; however, composing a NeRF with a latent diffusion model or another inductively-trained generative model yields a viable representation of the physical scene.

As a result, NLP models have become increasingly large and complex, capable of performing a wide range of tasks and understanding many languages. This talk will discuss the evolution of NLP models from specialized to generalist, drawing on the speaker’s personal experience working in the field for over ten years. Topics covered will include: building massively multilingual and large neural machine translation systems (M4); infrastructure and system research enabling the construction of such systems (GPipe, GShard); foundational machine learning research that has advanced the state-of-the-art predictability (aka scaling laws); deployment and organizational challenges in the large language model space; and more. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the future of NLP and the potential of LLMs to unlock new frontiers. View the recording >> Q. Vera Liao Microsoft Research HCI, AI Title: Human-Centered AI Transparency Date: November 2, 2023 Abstract: Transparency—enabling appropriate understanding of AI models or systems—is considered a pillar of responsible AI. The AI research community and industry have developed an abundance of techniques and artifacts in the hope of achieving transparency, including transparent model reporting, model evaluation, explainable AI, and communication of model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the human-computer interaction community has taken human-centered approaches to these topics, building on its long-standing interests in design to support user understanding and appropriate mental models. In this talk, Q. Vera Liao will give an overview of common approaches and lessons learned from HCI research on AI transparency. With the recent rise of large language models and LLM-infused systems, she will also reflect on their unique challenges in providing transparency and discuss open questions.

In this talk, Justine Sherry will discuss how SmartNICs do more than simply “accelerate” network-intensive computing. Instead, she argues that SmartNICs radically reorient the control of data movement within the server in a way that is necessary for server hardware to scale with the deluge of network traffic in data centers. She will illustrate a few exemplary systems—Pigasus IDS, the Ensō NIC protocol, and the KOPI OS architecture—from her own research group, as well as exciting work in other labs, all of which reorient server data movement using programmable NICs.

In contrast, unification has been more challenging in computer vision, partly due to the heterogeneity of tasks in the visual domain and a scarcity of robotics data in the physical world. How do we create powerful unified systems for vision and robotics that can be as capable and creative as their language counterparts? Aniruddha Kembhavi will first present his work on Unified IO, the first single neural model to perform a large and diverse set of AI tasks spanning classical computer vision, image synthesis, vision-and-language, and natural language processing, and his follow-up work, Unified IO 2, that brings in video, audio, and action. Then he will present his recent surprising finding in robotics: Imitating shortest path planners in simulation can produce agents that can proficiently navigate, explore, and manipulate objects in the real world, with no human data or RL and with just RGB sensing—made possible by his recent works on ProcTHOR, HoloDeck, and ObjaVerse. Finally, he will present a compelling alternative to building unified models, Visual Programming, which uses language models as code generators to invoke smaller specialized vision models. This paradigm is efficient and effective, leverages models sourced from the entire community, and scales easily to large sets of diverse tasks.

However, the past few years have unveiled numerous security flaws, placing billions of Bluetooth devices at risk. While luckily these flaws have been discovered (some of which have been fixed), there is no reason to believe that current BLE protocols and implementations are free from other flaws. In this talk, Zhiqiang Lin will present a line of recent efforts aimed at enhancing BLE security and privacy. In particular, he will first present the protocol-level downgrade attack, an attack that can force the secure BLE channels into insecure ones to break the data integrity and confidentiality of BLE traffic. Then, he will introduce the Bluetooth Address Tracking (BAT) attack, a novel protocol-level attack, which can track randomized Bluetooth MAC addresses by using an innovative allowlist-based side channel. Next, he will talk about the lessons learned, root causes of the attacks, and their countermeasures. Finally, he will conclude his talk by discussing future directions in Bluetooth security and privacy. View the recording >> 2020-21 Gerald M. Masson Distinguished Lecture Series Nick McKeown Stanford University Title: The Network as a Programmable Platform Date: October 13, 2020 Abstract: In the past 10 years, large network owners and operators have taken control of the software that controls their networks. They are now starting to take control of how packets are processed too. Networks, for the first time, are on the cusp of being programmable end-to-end, specified top-to-bottom, and defined entirely by software. We will think of the network as a programmable platform, a distributed system, that we specify top-down using software, rather than protocols. This has big ramifications for networks in the future, creating some interesting new possibilities to verify that a network is “correct by construction”, to measure and validate its behavior in real-time against a network specification, and to correct bugs through closed-loop control. 2019-20 Gerald M. Masson Distinguished Lecture Series Monica Lam Stanford Internet of Things Title: Building the Smartest and Open Virtual Assistant to Protect Privacy Date: October 8, 2019 Abstract: Virtual assistants, providing a voice interface to web services and IoTs, can potentially develop into monopolistic platforms that threaten consumer privacy and open competition. This talk presents Almond as an open-source alternative. Unlike existing commercial assistants, Almond can be programmed in natural language to perform new tasks. It lets users control who, what, when, where, and how their data are to be shared, all without disclosure to a third party. Almond has a Write-Once-Run-Anywhere (WORA) skill platform: skills need to be written only once and can run automatically on other assistants. This helps level the playing field for new assistants. Finally, Almond’s open-source technologies enable non-ML experts to develop natural language capabilities in their domains of interest. Through open-world collaboration, Almond can become the smartest virtual assistant. Lise Getoor UCSC ML + Privacy Title: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Structure Date: October 10, 2019 Abstract: Our ability to collect, manipulate, analyze, and act on vast amounts of data is having a profound impact on all aspects of society. Much of this data is heterogeneous in nature and interlinked in a myriad of complex ways. From information integration to scientific discovery to computational social science, we need machine learning methods that are able to exploit both the inherent uncertainty and the innate structure in a domain. Statistical relational learning (SRL) is a subfield that builds on principles from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from knowledge representation and logic to represent structure. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to SRL, present templates for common structured prediction problems, and describe modeling approaches that mix logic, probabilistic inference and latent variables. I’ll overview our recent work on probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a SRL framework for large-scale collective, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains. I’ll close by highlighting emerging opportunities (and challenges!!) in realizing the effectiveness of data and structure for knowledge discovery. Jodi Forlizzi CMU Human Computer Interactions Talk Title: Designing Today’s Product-Service Ecologies Date: November 7, 2019 Abstract: This talk will reflect my walk through the discipline of design’s many eras and shifts, in order to understand this movement from designing products to designing platforms. The eras of user-centered design, experience design, service design, and systems design will be explored to better understand this migration. An alternative framing, product-service ecologies, will be introduced to stress a systemic and ecological view as a design approach to designing the products, services, environments, and platforms of today. A systemic view ensures that the designer can identify a need and understand the implications of designing something to impact the ecology in a positive way. A systemic view helps move the designer from problem solving to problem seeking, from modeling to understanding relationships, and from prototyping to perturbing the system to understand outcomes. It also ensures that designers are creating pragmatic and purposeful systems that will improve the state of today’s world. 2018-19 Gerald M. Masson Distinguished Lecture Series Vijay Kumar University of Pennsylvania Title: Opportunities and Challenges in Autonomy for Small Aerial Vehicles Date: September 25, 2018 Abstract: The last decade has seen significant advances in robotics and artificial intelligence leading to an irrational exuberance in technology. I will discuss the challenges of realizing autonomous flight in environments with obstacles in the absence of GPS. I will describe our approaches to state estimation and designing perception-action loops for high speed navigation with applications to precision agriculture and first response. Finally, I will discuss some of limitations with current approaches in the field and challenges in robotics and autonomy. Dahlia Malkhi VMWare Research Title: BFT in the lens of Blockchains and Blockchains in the lens of BFT Date: October 9, 2018 Abstract: Blockchain is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) replicated state machine, in which each state-update is by itself a Turing machine with bounded resources. The core algorithm for achieving BFT in a Blockchain appears completely different from classical BFT algorithms:Recent advances in blockchain technology blur these boundaries. Namely, hybrid solutions such as Byzcoin, Bitcoin-NG, Hybrid Consensus, Casper and Solida, anchor off-chain BFT decisions inside a PoW chain or the other way around. This talk keynote will describe Blockchain in the lens of BFT and BFT in the lens of Blockchain, and provide common algorithmic foundations for both. Margo Seltzer University of British Columbia Talk Title: Automatically Scalable Computation Date: November 6, 2018 Abstract: As our computational infrastructure races gracefully forward into increasingly parallel multi-core and clustered systems, our ability to easily produce software that can successfully exploit such systems continues to stumble. For years, we’ve fantasized about the world in which we’d write simple, sequential programs, add magic sauce, and suddenly have scalable, parallel executions. We’re not there. We’re not even close. I’ll present a radical, potentially crazy approach to automatic scalability, combining learning, prediction, and speculation. To date, we’ve achieved shockingly good scalability and reasonable speedup in limited domains, but the potential is tantalizingly enormous. Eva Tardos Cornell Title: Learning and Efficiency of Outcomes in Games Date: April 2, 2019 Abstract : Selfish behavior can often lead to suboptimal outcome for all participants, a phenomenon illustrated by many classical examples in game theory. Over the last decade we have studied Nash equilibria of games, and developed good understanding how to quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in many games (including traffic routing as well as online auctions). In this talk we will focus on games where players use a form of learning that helps them adapt to the environment. We ask if the quantitative guarantees obtained for Nash equilibria extend to such out of equilibrium game play, or even more broadly, when the game or the population of players is dynamically changing and where participants have to adapt to the dynamic environment. Avrim Blum Professor and Chief Academic Officer Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago Talk Title: Algorithmic fairness in Online Decision-making Date: April 16, 2019 Abstract: There is growing concern about fairness in algorithmic decision making: Are algorithmic decisions treating different groups fairly? How can we make them fairer? What do we even mean by fair? In this talk I will discuss some of our work on this topic, focusing on the setting of online decision making. For instance, a classic result states that given a collection of predictors, one can adaptively combine them to perform nearly as well as the best of those predictors in hindsight (achieve “no regret”) without any stochastic assumptions. Can one extend this guarantee so that if the predictors are themselves fair (according to a given definition), then the overall combination is fair as well (according to the same definition)? I will discuss this and other issues. This is joint work with Suriya Gunasekar, Thodoris Lykouris, and Nati Srebro. 2017-18 Gerald M. Masson Distinguished Lecture Series Susan Davidson University of Pennsylvania Title: Why Data Citation is a Computational Problem Date: October 5, 2017 Abstract: While principles and standards have been developed for data citation, they are unlikely to be used unless we can couple the process of extracting information with that of providing a citation for it. I will discuss the problem of automatically generating citations for data in a database given how the data was obtained (the query) as well as the content (the data), and show how the problem of generating a citation is related to two well-studied problems in databases: query rewriting using views and provenance.To download Dr. Davidson’s lecture poster, click here .

Shafi Goldwasser Massachusetts Institute of Technology Title: Pseudo Deterministic Algorithms and Proofs Date: Thursday, October 12, 2017 Abstract: Pseudo-deterministic algorithms are a class of randomized search algorithms, which output a unique answer with high probability. Intuitively, they are indistinguishable from deterministic algorithms by an polynomial time observer of their input/output behavior. In this talk I will describe what is known about pseudo-deterministic algorithms in the sequential, sub-linear and parallel setting. To download Dr. Goldwasser’s lecture series poster, click here . Ian Foster University of Chicago Title: Computing Just What You Need: Online Data Analysis and Reduction of Extreme Scales Date: Tuesday, December 5, 2017 Abstract: A growing disparity between supercomputer computation speeds and I/O rates makes it increasingly infeasible for applications to save all results for offline analysis. Instead, applications must analyze and reduce data online so as to output only those results needed to answer target scientific question(s).

Manuelo Veloso University of California, Berkeley Title: Human-AI Interaction: Symbiotic Autonomy, Learning, and Transparency in Service Robots Date: Thursday, April 12, 2018 Abstract: In this talk, I will first introduce our CoBot service robots and their novel localization and symbiotic autonomy, which enable them to consistently move in our buildings, and learn from asking humans or the web for help to overcome their limitations. I frame the research as human-AI interaction also including an interpretability approach by language generation to alert and respond to human explanation requests.

Association for Computing Machinery Lecture Series in Memory of Nathan Krasnopoler This lecture series is made possible by the generosity of numerous supporters of the Nathan Krasnopoler Memorial Fund, established at the Whiting School of Engineering to benefit the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM.) Nathan Krasnopoler ’13, a computer science major, was severely injured in February 2011 when he was struck by a car while bicycling near the Homewood campus. Although he was wearing a helmet, Nathan suffered irreversible brain damage and passed away from his injuries in August 2011. A student of great promise and a leader in the Johns Hopkins chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Nathan was an active and valued member of the Johns Hopkins community. As a result of the crash and to prevent future injuries and loss of life caused by medically-impaired older drivers, Nathan’s family formed Americans For Older Driver Safety, a non-profit organization with a national focus. Since 2012, AFODS has promoted education of older drivers using research-based best practices. AFODS has created a curriculum for educating older drivers, has worked on public policy changes in Maryland, Missouri, and Kansas, and is currently developing an educational program for health care providers on medical conditions that affect driving and giving providers printed information for their patients on local mobility programs and driving evaluation programs. Gifts to this fund are used to sponsor an annual lecture in Nathan’s memory and to benefit the activities of the ACM. If you would like to honor Nathan’s memory and his dedication to the ACM, you are invited to make a tax-deductible contribution to the fund.

For new students, please indicate your interest in this track in the admissions application . Human Language Technology is the science behind computer processing of human language, and is the driving force in modern software and consumer electronics. Automatic speech recognition and natural language processing underlie many technologies that are now used daily by millions of people to interact with mobile technology. Machine translation is being used more and more as its accuracy improves to translate web pages from one language to another, and our ability to extract useful information from text allows us to index and search billions of websites in fractions of a second. While HLT has grown in its use and importance, the supply of PhDs from academia has failed to keep up with industry’s growing demand for experts capable of developing and deploying needed technologies. The HLT concentration at Johns Hopkins aims to prepare students for work in industry over the course of just three or four semesters. In the HLT master’s concentration, students learn the mathematical and computational ideas behind these increasingly common technologies. You will learn how to implement these  methods using popular programming languages and open-source frameworks and how to deploy these methods at scale using cloud computing resources and high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Students will have the opportunity to work on group projects under the direct supervision of distinguished academic researchers in a practicum-style course. The HLT concentration requirements are intended to allow specialization in a particular technology, such as machine translation, machine learning, or automatic speech recognition. The HLT master’s concentration exists for both the Masters in Computer Science and the Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Students will have to fulfill the requirements for the degree program, and take the following courses: Introduction to Human Language Technology (601.667) Natural Language Processing (601.665) Information Extraction from Speech and Text (520.666) Students will also have to complete a Master’s project/thesis related to Human Language Technology. Sample Courses Fall Semester, First Year Introduction to Human Language Technology (601.667 CSCI-APPL) Natural Language Processing (601.665 CSCI-APPL) Additional CS or ECE course Spring Semester, First Year Information Extraction from Speech and Text (520.666) Two additional CS or ECE courses Summer Semester Start Project/ Thesis/ Internship Fall Semester, Second Year Two additional CS or ECE courses Project/ Thesis (completion) Students are allowed and encouraged to select other courses from other departments that are relevant to the Human Language Technology Master’s Concentration. The HLT concentration is an intense introduction to Human Language Technology, open to those enrolled in the MSE or PhD programs in the Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments at Johns Hopkins University. The academic year 2019-2020 will be the first year this concentration is offered. The HLT concentration is intended to prepare students  for careers in industry, though we anticipate that some of our graduates may go on to pursue PhD studies. Students in the HLT concentration will take courses alongside PhD students, especially students affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Center for Language and Speech Processing. Successful applicants will have a strong background in undergraduate-level programming and math (primarily calculus and linear algebra). The application process is handled through the university’s online graduate student application . Johns Hopkins University is home to an active group of exceptional researchers in Human Language Technology. Our PhD students have gone on to work in both academia and at leading technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, and may have gone on to form their own startups. PhD programs at Johns Hopkins and similar universities are not producing graduates fast enough to meet the intense industry demand for expertise in HLT. The HLT concentration aims to prepare students for work with HLT in industry over just three or four semesters.

Paths to AI Accountability Sarah Cen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 25, 2024 Abstract: We have begun grappling with difficult questions related to the rise of AI, including: What rights do individuals have in the age of AI? When should we regulate AI and when should we abstain? What degree of transparency is needed to monitor AI systems? These questions are all concerned with AI accountability. In this talk, Sarah Cen discusses the two components of her research on AI accountability and illustrates them through a case study on auditing social media. Within the context of social media, she will focus on how social media platforms filter (or curate) the content that users see. In particular, Cen will propose a way to implement regulations on social media that is compatible with free speech protections and Section 230. She will then present a way to test whether a content curation algorithm complies with regulations, producing what we call a “counterfactual audit.” In studying the properties of this approach, she will show that it has strong theoretical guarantees, does not violate user privacy, and uses only black-box access to the algorithm (thereby requiring minimal access to proprietary algorithms and data). She will demonstrate how this audit can be applied in practice using LLMs on a live social media platform. Speaker Biography: Sarah Cen is a final-year PhD student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where she is advised by Professors Aleksander Mądry and Devavrat Shah. Cen utilizes methods from machine learning, statistical inference, causal inference, and game theory to study responsible computing and AI policy. Previously, she has written about social media, trustworthy algorithms, algorithmic fairness, and more. She is currently interested in AI auditing, AI supply chains, and the intellectual property rights of data providers. What's Wrong with Large Language Models and What We Should Be Building Instead Tom Dietterich, Oregon State University View the recording >> Institute for Assured Autonomy & Computer Science Seminar Series April 16, 2024 Abstract: Large language models provide a pre-trained foundation for training many interesting AI systems. However, they have many shortcomings: They are expensive to train and to update, their non-linguistic knowledge is poor, they make false and self-contradictory statements, and these statements can be socially and ethically inappropriate. This talk will review these shortcomings and current efforts to address them within the existing LLM framework. It will then argue for a different, more modular architecture that decomposes the functions of existing LLMs and adds several additional components. We believe this alternative can address many of the shortcomings of LLMs. Speaker Biography: Tom Dietterich (AB Oberlin College 1977; MS University of Illinois 1979; PhD Stanford University 1984) is Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University. Dietterich is one of the pioneers of the field of machine learning and has authored more than 200 refereed publications and two books. He is a fellow of the ACM, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence . His current research topics include robust artificial intelligence, robust human-AI systems, and applications in sustainability. Structured World Models for Robots Krishna Murthy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 12, 2024 Abstract: Humans have an innate ability to construct detailed mental representations of the world from limited sensory data. These “world models” are central to natural intelligence, allowing us to perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. Krishna Murthy’s research seeks to create “computational world models”—artificial intelligence techniques that enable robots to understand and operate in the world around as effectively as humans. Despite the impressive successes of modern machine learning approaches in media such as text, images, and video—where abundant training data is readily available—these advancements have not translated to robotics. Building generally capable robotic systems presents unique challenges, including this lack of data and the need to adapt learning algorithms to a wide variety of embodiments, environments, and tasks of interest. In his talk, Murthy will present how his research contributes to the design of computational models for spatial, physical, and multimodal understanding. He will discuss differentiable computing approaches that have advanced the field of spatial perception, enabling an understanding of the structure of the 3D world, its constituent objects, and their semantic and physical properties from videos. He will also detail how his work interfaces advances in large image, language, and audio models with 3D scenes, enabling robots and computer vision systems to flexibly query these structured world models for a wide range of tasks. Finally, he will outline his vision for the future, where structured world models and modern scaling-based approaches work in tandem to create versatile robot perception and planning algorithms with the potential to meet and ultimately surpass human-level capabilities. Speaker Biography: Krishna Murthy is a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with Antonio Torralba and Josh Tenenbaum. He previously completed his PhD at Mila and the University of Montreal, where he was advised by Liam Paull. Murthy’s research focuses on building computational world models to help embodied agents perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. He has led the organization of multiple workshops on themes spanning differentiable programming, physical reasoning, 3D vision and graphics, and ML research dissemination. His research has been recognized with graduate fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google (2021); a Best Paper Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Robotics and Automation Letters (2019); and an induction to the Robotics: Science and Systems Pioneers cohort (2020). Robot Navigation in Complex Indoor and Outdoor Environments Dinesh Manocha, University of Maryland, College Park View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 11, 2024 Abstract: In the last few decades, most robotics success stories have been limited to structured or controlled environments. A major challenge is to develop robot systems that can operate in complex or unstructured environments corresponding to homes, dense traffic, outdoor terrains, public places, etc. In this talk, Dinesh Manocha gives an overview of his ongoing work on developing robust planning and navigation technologies that use recent advances in computer vision, sensor technologies, machine learning, and motion planning algorithms. He presents new methods that utilize multimodal observations from an RGB camera, 3D LiDAR, and robot odometry for scene perception, along with deep reinforcement learning  for reliable planning; the latter is also used to compute dynamically feasible and spatially aware velocities for a robot navigating among mobile obstacles and uneven terrains. These methods have been integrated with wheeled robots, home robots, and legged platforms and their performance has been highlighted in crowded indoor scenes, home environments, and dense outdoor terrains. Speaker Biography: Dinesh Manocha is the Paul Chrisman Iribe Professor of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park.

He was also a co-founder of Impulsonic, a developer of physics-based audio simulation technologies that was acquired by Valve Corporation in November of 2016. A First-Principles Approach to Deep Learning and Applications to Quantum Materials Yasaman Bahri, Google DeepMind View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 8, 2024 Abstract: Recent years have seen unprecedented advancements in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. For the applied sciences, these tools offer new paradigms for combining insights developed from theory, computation, and experiments towards design and discovery, and for bridging the microscopic world with the macroscopic. Beyond treating them as black boxes, however, uncovering and distilling the fundamental principles behind how systems built with neural networks work is a grand challenge, and one that can be aided by ideas, tools, and methodologies from physics. Yasaman Bahri will describe one pillar of her research that takes a first-principles approach to deep learning through the lens of statistical physics, exactly solvable models and mean-field theories, and nonlinear dynamics. She will discuss new connections she discovered between large-width deep neural networks, Gaussian processes, and kernels; the emergence of linear models during training and phase transitions away from them; experimentally-consistent insights into scaling laws; and an outlook on the next frontiers in this research program. She will then discuss the early stages of a second research program proceeding in the reverse direction, in which a deeper understanding of ML and AI can be used to advance the quantum sciences and quantum materials. As an early example, Bahri considers physics as a domain to examine recall and reasoning in large language models. She will describe work investigating the ability of such models to perform analytic Hartree-Fock mean-field calculations in quantum many-body physics. Speaker Biography: Yasaman Bahri is a research scientist at Google DeepMind. Her research lies at the confluence of machine learning and the physical sciences. She completed her PhD in physics at the University of California, Berkeley as an NSF Graduate Fellow, specializing in the theory of quantum condensed matter. Her doctoral work investigated quantum matter through the themes of topology, symmetry, and localization. She has been an invited lecturer at the Les Houches School of Physics, is a past Rising Star in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and was a co-organizer of a recent program on deep learning at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. SmartBook: An AI Prophetess for Disaster Reporting and Forecasting Heng Ji, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 5, 2024 Abstract: History repeats itself—sometimes in a bad way. Preventing natural or man-made disasters requires being aware of these patterns and taking preemptive action to address and reduce them—or ideally, eliminate them. Emerging events, such as the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, require a time-sensitive, comprehensive understanding of the situation to allow for appropriate decision-making and effective action response. Automated generation of situation reports can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for domain experts when preparing their official, human-curated reports. However, AI research toward this goal has been very limited and no successful trials have yet been conducted to automate such report generation and “what-if” disaster forecasting. Preexisting natural language processing and information retrieval techniques are insufficient to identify, locate, and summarize important information and lack detailed, structured, and strategic awareness. In this talk, Heng Ji will present SmartBook, a novel framework that cannot be solved by large language models alone to consume large volumes of multimodal multilingual news data and produce a structured situation report with multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded with rich links to factual evidence through multimodal knowledge extraction, claim detection, fact checking, misinformation detection, and factual error correction. Furthermore, SmartBook can also serve as a novel news event simulator or an intelligent prophetess. Given “what-if” conditions and dimensions elicited from a domain expert user concerning a disaster scenario, SmartBook will induce schemas from historical events and automatically generate a complex event graph along with a timeline of news articles that describe new simulated events and character-centric stories based on a new Λ-shaped attention mask that can generate text with infinite length. By effectively simulating disaster scenarios in both event graph and natural language formats, SmartBook is expected to greatly assist humanitarian workers and policymakers to exercise reality checks and thus better prevent and respond to future disasters. Speaker Biography: Heng Ji is a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where she is an affiliated faculty member of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Coordinated Science Laboratory.

Enforcing Right to Explanation: Algorithmic Challenges and Opportunities Himabindu Lakkaraju, Harvard University View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 4, 2024 Abstract: As predictive and generative models are increasingly being deployed in various high-stakes applications in critical domains including health care, law, policy, and finance, it is important to ensure that relevant stakeholders understand the behaviors and outputs of these models so that they can determine if and when to intervene. To this end, several techniques have been proposed in recent literature to explain these models; in addition, multiple regulatory frameworks (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation , the California Consumer Privacy Act ) introduced in recent years also emphasize the importance of enforcing the key principle of “right to explanation” to ensure that individuals who are adversely impacted by algorithmic outcomes are provided with an actionable explanation. In this talk, Himabindu Lakkaraju will discuss the gaps that exist between regulations and state-of-the-art technical solutions when it comes to explainability of predictive and generative models. She will then present some of her latest research that attempts to address some of these gaps. She will conclude her talk by discussing bigger challenges that arise as we think about enforcing right to explanation in the context of large language models and other large generative models. Speaker Biography: Himabindu “Hima” Lakkaraju is an assistant professor at Harvard University focusing on the algorithmic, theoretical, and applied aspects of explainability, fairness, and robustness of machine learning models. Lakkaraju has been named as one of the world’s top innovators under 35 by both MIT Tech Review and Vanity Fair.

More recently, she co-founded the Trustworthy ML Initiative to enable easy access to resources on trustworthy ML and to build a community of researchers and practitioners working on the topic. Model-Based Methods in Today’s Data-Driven Robotics Landscape Seth Hutchinson, Georgia Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 3, 2024 Abstract: Data-driven machine learning methods are making advances in many long-standing problems in robotics, including grasping, legged locomotion, perception, and more. There are, however, robotics applications for which data-driven methods are less effective. Data acquisition can be expensive, time consuming, or dangerous—to the surrounding workspace, humans in the workspace, or the robot itself. In such cases, generating data via simulation might seem a natural recourse, but simulation methods come with their own limitations, particularly when nondeterministic effects are significant or when complex dynamics are at play, requiring heavy computation and exposing the so-called sim2real gap. Another alternative is to rely on a set of demonstrations, limiting the amount of required data by careful curation of the training examples; however, these methods fail when confronted with problems that were not represented in the training examples (so-called out-of-distribution problems) and this precludes the possibility of providing provable performance guarantees. In this talk, Seth Hutchinson will describe recent work on robotics problems that do not readily admit data-driven solutions, including flapping flight by a bat-like robot, vision-based control of soft continuum robots, a cable-driven graffiti-painting robot, and ensuring safe operation of mobile manipulators in human-robot interaction scenarios. He will describe some specific difficulties that confront data-driven methods for these problems and how model-based approaches can provide workable solutions. Along the way, he will also discuss how judicious incorporation of data-driven machine learning tools can enhance performance of these methods.

Making Machine Learning Predictably Reliable Andrew Ilyas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series April 1, 2024 Abstract: Despite machine learning models’ impressive performance, training and deploying them is currently a somewhat messy endeavor. But does it have to be? In this talk, Andrew Ilyas overviews his work on making ML “predictably reliable”—enabling developers to know when their models will work, when they will fail, and why. To begin, he uses a case study of adversarial inputs to show that human intuition can be a poor predictor of how ML models operate. Motivated by this, he presents a line of work that aims to develop a precise understanding of the ML pipeline, combining statistical tools with large-scale experiments to characterize the role of each individual design choice: from how to collect data, to what dataset to train on, to what learning algorithm to use. Speaker Biography: Andrew Ilyas is a PhD student in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is advised by Aleksander Madry and Constantinos Daskalakis. His research aims to improve the reliability and predictability of machine learning systems. He was previously supported by an Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship. Accessible Foundation Models: Systems, Algorithms, and Science Tim Dettmers, University of Washington View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 28, 2024 Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of foundation models, such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold, has revolutionized AI and science more generally. However, increasing scale also steadily raises computational barriers, blocking almost everyone from studying, adapting, or otherwise using these models for anything beyond static API queries. In this talk, Tim Dettmers will present research that significantly lowers these barriers for a wide range of use cases, including inference algorithms that are used to make predictions after training, fine-tuning approaches that adapt a trained model to new data, and finally, full training of foundation models from scratch. For inference, he will describe the LLM.int8() algorithm, which showed how to enable high-precision 8-bit matrix multiplication that is both fast and memory efficient. LLM.int8() is based on the discovery and characterization of sparse outlier sub-networks that only emerge at large model scales, but are crucial for effective Int8 quantization. For fine-tuning, he will introduce the QLoRA algorithm, which pushes such quantization much further to unlock fine-tuning of very large models on a single GPU by only updating a small set of the parameters while keeping most of the network in a new information-theoretically optimal 4-bit representation. For full training, he will present SWARM parallelism, which allows collaborative training of foundation models across continents on standard internet infrastructure while still being 80% as effective as the prohibitively expensive supercomputers that are currently used. Finally, he will close by outlining his plans to make foundation models 100x more accessible, which will be needed to maintain truly open AI-based scientific innovation as models continue to scale. Speaker Biography: Tim Dettmers’ research focuses on making foundation models, such as ChatGPT, accessible to researchers and practitioners by reducing their resource requirements. This involves developing novel compression and networking algorithms and building systems that allow for memory-efficient, fast, and cheap deep learning. These methods enable many more people to use, adapt, or train foundation models without affecting the quality of AI predictions or generations. Dettmers is a PhD candidate at the University of Washington and has won oral, spotlight, and best paper awards at conferences such as the International Conference on Learning Representations and the Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems . He created the bitsandbytes library for efficient deep learning, which is growing at 1.4 million installations per month, and has received Google Open Source and PyTorch Foundation awards. Data-Distributional Approaches for Generalizable Language Models Sang Michael Xie, Stanford University View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 25, 2024 Abstract: High-quality datasets are crucial for improving the capabilities and training efficiency of large language models. However, current datasets are typically prepared in an ad hoc, heuristic way.

First, he will describe how to improve the efficiency of training multipurpose language models by optimizing the mixture of data sources with robust optimization. Second, he will discuss an efficient importance resampling method for selecting relevant data from trillion-token-scale web datasets for training a specialized model. Finally, he will introduce a first theoretical analysis of in-context learning, a key capability of language models to learn from examples in a textual prompt, that traces the capability back to modeling coherence structure in the pre-training data. Speaker Biography: Sang Michael Xie is a computer science PhD student at Stanford University advised by Percy Liang and Tengyu Ma.

Data Privacy in the Decentralized Era Amrita Roy Chowdhury, University of California San Diego View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 21, 2024 Abstract: Data is today generated on smart devices at the edge, shaping a decentralized data ecosystem comprised of multiple data owners (clients) and a service provider (server). Clients interact with the server with their personal data for specific services, while the server performs analysis on the joint dataset. However, the sensitive nature of the data involved, coupled with the inherent misalignment of incentives between clients and the server, breeds mutual distrust. Consequently, a key question arises: How can we facilitate private data analytics within a decentralized data ecosystem comprised of multiple distrusting parties? Amrita Roy Chowdhury’s research shows a way forward by designing systems that offer strong and provable privacy guarantees while preserving complete data functionality. She accomplishes this by systematically exploring the synergy between cryptography and differential privacy, exposing their rich interconnections in both theory and practice. In this talk , she will focus on two systems, CryptE and EIFFeL, which enable privacy-preserving query analytics and machine learning, respectively. Speaker Biography: Amrita Roy Chowdhury is a Computing Research Association and Computing Community Consortium Computing Innovation Fellow working with Kamalika Chaudhuri at the University of California San Diego.

Her work explores the synergy between differential privacy and cryptography through novel algorithms that expose the rich interconnections between the two areas, both in theory and practice. Chowdhury has been recognized as a Rising Star in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2020 and 2021. She was also both a Facebook Fellowship finalist and selected as a Rising Star in Data Science by the University of Chicago in 2021. Learning and Planning with Relational Abstractions Tom Silver, Massachusetts Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 20, 2024 Abstract: Decision-making in robotics domains is complicated by continuous state and action spaces, long horizons, and sparse feedback. One way to address these challenges is to perform bilevel planning, where decision-making is decomposed into reasoning about “what to do” (task planning) and “how to do it” (continuous optimization). Bilevel planning is powerful, but it requires multiple types of domain-specific abstractions that are often difficult to design by hand. In this talk, Tom Silver will give an overview of his work on learning these abstractions from data; this work represents the first unified system for learning all the abstractions needed for bilevel planning. In addition to learning to plan, he will also discuss planning to learn, where the robot uses planning to collect additional data that it can use to improve its abstractions. His long-term goal is to create a virtuous cycle where learning improves planning and planning improves learning, leading to a very general library of abstractions and a broadly competent robot. Speaker Biography: Tom Silver is a final-year PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, advised by Leslie Kaelbling and Josh Tenenbaum. His research is at the intersection of machine learning and planning with applications to robotics and often uses techniques from task and motion planning, program synthesis, and neuro-symbolic learning. Before graduate school, he was a researcher at Vicarious AI and received his BA with highest honors in computer science and mathematics from Harvard in 2016. Silver has also interned at Google Research (in brain robotics) and currently splits his time between MIT and the Boston Dynamics AI Institute. His work is supported by an NSF Fellowship and an MIT Presidential Fellowship. Towards Scalable Decentralized Systems Mingyuan Wang, University of California, Berkeley View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 19, 2024 Abstract: Decentralized systems enable mutually distrusting parties to collaboratively control a system; this fosters trust as no single corrupted party can break the system, while utility is ensured through collective participation. In recent years, decentralized systems have found many applications, particularly within the blockchain ecosystem. Traditionally, the robustness and security of a decentralized system increase with the number of participating parties. Consequently, the primary objective of decentralization is to scale the system to accommodate as many parties as possible. However, the existing framework for realizing threshold cryptography, the core cryptographic primitive enabling decentralization, still relies on interactive setup processes, posing significant scalability challenges in real-world scenarios. Additionally, it lacks the flexibility to handle advanced features such as weights, dynamism, and multiverse, which are highly desired in practice. In this talk, Mingyuan Wang will discuss his research work that proposes new techniques to address these issues, which pave the way for truly scalable decentralized cryptographic systems. He will conclude the talk by briefly discussing other research problems that he is interested in. Speaker Biography: Mingyuan Wang is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, hosted by Sanjam Garg. He received his PhD from Purdue University, where he was advised by Hemanta K. Maji. Wang is interested in cryptography and its interplay with theoretical computer science and security.

His work has been published at top venues, such as Crypto, Eurocrypt, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, the Theory of Cryptography Conference, the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, and more. Knowledge-Rich Language Systems in a Dynamic World Eunsol Choi, University of Texas at Austin View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 15, 2024 Abstract: Natural language provides an intuitive and powerful interface to access knowledge at scale. Modern language systems draw information from two rich knowledge sources: (1) information stored in their parameters during massive pretraining and (2) documents retrieved at inference time. Yet we are far from building systems that can reliably provide information from such knowledge sources. In this talk, Eunsol Choi will discuss paths for more robust systems. In the first part of her talk, she will present a module for scaling retrieval-based knowledge augmentation, learning a compressor that maps retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration; this not only reduces the computational costs but also filters irrelevant or incorrect information. In the second half of her talk, she will discuss the challenges of updating knowledge stored in model parameters and propose a method to prevent models from reciting outdated information by identifying facts that are prone to rapid change. She will conclude her talk by proposing an interactive system that can elicit information from users when needed. Speaker Biography: Eunsol Choi is an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. Prior to teaching at UT, she spent a year at Google AI as a visiting researcher.

Hardware-Aware Efficient Primitives for Machine Learning Dan Fu, Stanford University View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 7, 2024 Abstract: Efficiency is increasingly tied to quality in machine learning, with more efficient training algorithms leading to more powerful models. However, today’s most popular machine learning models are built on asymptotically inefficient primitives. For example, attention in transformers scales quadratically with input size, while multilayer perceptrons scale quadratically with model dimension. In this talk, Dan Fu discusses his work on improving the efficiency of core primitives in machine learning, with an emphasis on hardware-aware algorithms and long-context applications. First, he focuses on replacing attention with gated state space models (SSMs) and convolutions, which scale sub-quadratically in context length. He describes the H3 (Hungry Hungry Hippos) architecture, a gated SSM architecture that matches transformers in quality up to 3B parameters and achieves 2.4x faster inference. Second, he focuses on developing hardware-aware algorithms for SSMs and convolutions; he describes FlashFFTConv, a fast algorithm for computing SSMs and convolutions on GPU by optimizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT). FlashFFTConv yields up to 7x speedup and 5x memory savings, even over vendor solutions from NVIDIA. Third, he will briefly touch on how these same techniques can also be used to develop sub-quadratic scaling in the model dimension. He will describe Monarch Mixer, which uses a generalization of the FFT to achieve sub-quadratic scaling in both sequence length and model dimension. Throughout the talk, he will give examples of how these ideas are beginning to take hold, with gated SSMs and their variants now leading to state-of-the-art performance in long-context language models, embedding models, and DNA foundation models.

Learning to See the World in 3D Ayush Tewari, Massachusetts Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 6, 2024 Abstract: Humans can effortlessly construct rich mental representations of the 3D world from sparse input, such as a single image. This is a core aspect of intelligence that helps us understand and interact with our surroundings and with each other. Ayush Tewari’s research aims to build similar computational models: artificial intelligence methods that can perceive properties of the 3D structured world from images and videos. Despite remarkable progress in 2D computer vision, 3D perception remains an open problem due to some unique challenges, such as limited 3D training data and uncertainties in reconstruction. In this talk, Tewari will discuss these challenges and explain how his research addresses them by posing vision as an inverse problem and by designing machine learning models with physics-inspired inductive biases. He will demonstrate techniques for reconstructing 3D faces and objects and for reasoning about uncertainties in scene reconstruction using generative models. He will then discuss how these efforts advance scalable and generalizable visual perception and how they advance application domains such as robotics and computer graphics.

Particularly, the principles governing intracellular molecular spatial organization and cellular spatial organization within complex tissues are still largely unclear. A major challenge lies in developing computational methods capable of integrating heterogeneous and multiscale molecular, cellular, and tissue information. In this talk, Jian Ma will discuss his recent work on creating integrative approaches for single-cell spatial epigenomics and transcriptomics.

Improving, Evaluating, and Detecting Long-Form LLM-Generated Text Mohit Iyyer, University of Massachusetts Amherst View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series March 1, 2024 Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled them to process texts exceeding 100,000 tokens in length, fueling demand for long-form language processing tasks such as the summarization or translation of books. However, LLMs struggle to take full advantage of the information within such long contexts, which contributes to factually incorrect and incoherent text generation. In this talk, Mohit Iyyer will first demonstrate an issue that plagues even modern LLMs: their tendency to assign high probability to implausible long-form continuations of their input. He will then describe a contrastive sequence-level ranking model that mitigates this problem at decoding time and that can also be adapted to the reinforcement learning from human feedback alignment paradigm. Next, he will consider the growing problem of long-form evaluation : As the length of the inputs and outputs of long-form tasks grows, how do we even measure progress (via both humans and machines)? He proposes a high-level framework that first decomposes a long-form text into simpler atomic units before then evaluating each unit on a specific aspect. He demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness at evaluating factuality and coherence on tasks such as biography generation and book summarization. He will also discuss the rapid proliferation of LLM-generated long-form text, which plagues not only evaluation (e.g., via Mechanical Turkers using ChatGPT to complete tasks) but also society as a whole, and he will describe novel watermarking strategies to detect such text. Finally, he will conclude by discussing his future research vision, which aims to extend long-form language processing to multilingual, multimodal, and collaborative human-centered settings. Speaker Biography: Mohit Iyyer is an associate professor in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a primary research interest in natural language generation.

Stochastic Computer Graphics Silvia Sellán, University of Toronto View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 29, 2024 Abstract: Computer graphics research has long been dominated by the interests of large film, television, and social media companies, forcing other, more safety-critical applications (e.g., medicine, engineering, security) to repurpose graphics algorithms originally designed for entertainment. In this talk, Silvia Sellán will advocate for a perspective shift in this field that allows researchers to design algorithms directly for these safety-critical application realms. She will show that this begins by reinterpreting traditional graphics tasks (e.g., 3D modeling and reconstruction) from a statistical lens and quantifying the uncertainty in algorithmic outputs, as exemplified by the research she has conducted for the past five years. She will end by mentioning several ongoing and future research directions that carry this statistical lens to entirely new problems in graphics and vision and into specific applications. Speaker Biography: Sellán is a fifth-year computer science PhD student at the University of Toronto, working in computer graphics and geometry processing. She is a Vanier Doctoral Scholar, an Adobe Research Fellow, and the winner of the 2021 University of Toronto Arts & Science Dean’s Doctoral Excellence Scholarship.

Decision-Making with Internet-Scale Knowledge Sherry Yang, University of California, Berkeley View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 28, 2024 Abstract: Machine learning models pre-trained on internet data have acquired broad knowledge about the world, but struggle to solve complex tasks that require extended reasoning and planning. Sequential decision-making, on the other hand, has empowered AlphaGo’s superhuman performance, but lacks visual, language, and physical knowledge about the world. In this talk, Sherry Yang will present her research towards enabling decision making with internet-scale knowledge. First, she will illustrate how language models and video generation are unified interfaces that can integrate internet knowledge and represent diverse tasks, enabling the creation of a generative simulator to support real-world decision-making. Second, she will discuss her work on designing decision-making algorithms that can take advantage of generative language and video models as agents and environments. Combining pre-trained models with decision-making algorithms can effectively enable a wide range of applications such as developing chatbots, learning robot policies, and discovering novel materials.

Building Planetary-Scale Collaborative Intelligence Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, University of California, Berkeley View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 22, 2024 Abstract: Today, access to high-quality data has become the key bottleneck to deploying machine learning. Often, the data that is most valuable is locked away in inaccessible silos due to unfavorable incentives and ethical or legal restrictions. This is starkly evident in health care, where such barriers have led to highly biased and underperforming tools. In his talk, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy will describe how collaborative systems, such as federated learning, provide a natural solution; they can remove barriers to data sharing by respecting the privacy and interests of the data providers. Yet for these systems to truly succeed, three fundamental challenges must be confronted: These systems need to 1) be efficient and scale to large networks, 2) provide reliable and trustworthy training and predictions, and 3) manage the divergent goals and interests of the participants. Karimireddy will discuss how tools from optimization, statistics, and economics can be leveraged to address these challenges. Speaker Biography: Sai Praneeth Karimireddy is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley with Mike I. Jordan .

Replicability in Machine Learning Jessica Sorrell, University of Pennsylvania View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 15, 2024 Abstract: Replicability is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of replicability have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study; machine learning is no exception. While failures of replicability in machine learning are multifactorial, one obstacle to replication efforts is the ambiguity in whether or not a replication effort was successful when many good models exist for a task. In this talk, we will discuss a new formalization of replicability for batch and reinforcement learning algorithms and demonstrate how to solve fundamental tasks in learning under the constraints of replicability. We will also discuss how replicability relates to other algorithmic desiderata in responsible computing, such as differential privacy. Speaker Biography: Jessica Sorrell is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where she works with Aaron Roth and Michael Kearns. She completed her PhD at the University of California San Diego, advised by Russell Impagliazzo and Daniele Micciancio. She is broadly interested in the theoretical foundations of responsible computing and her work spans a variety of pressing issues in machine learning, such as replicability, privacy, and fairness. Towards More Human-Like Learning in Machines: Bridging the Data and Generalization Gaps Brenden M. Lake, New York University View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 12, 2024 Abstract: There is an enormous data gap between how AI systems and children learn language: The best LLMs now learn language from text with a word count in the trillions, whereas it would take a child roughly 100K years to reach those numbers through speech. There is also a clear generalization gap: Whereas machines struggle with systematic generalization, people excel. For instance, once a child learns how to “skip,” they immediately know how to “skip twice” or “skip around the room with their hands up” due to their compositional skills. In this talk, Brenden Lake will describe two case studies in addressing these gaps. The first addresses the data gap, in which deep neural networks were trained from scratch, not on large-scale data from the web, but through the eyes and ears of a single child. Using head-mounted video recordings from a child, this study shows how deep neural networks can acquire many word-referent mappings, generalize to novel visual referents, and achieve multi-modal alignment. The results demonstrate how today’s AI models are capable of learning key aspects of children’s early knowledge from realistic input. The second case study addresses the generalization gap. Can neural networks capture human-like systematic generalization? This study addresses a 35-year-old debate catalyzed by Fodor and Pylyshyn’s classic article, which argued that standard neural networks are not viable models of the mind because they lack systematic compositionality—the algebraic ability to understand and produce novel combinations from known components. This study shows how neural networks can achieve humanlike systematic generalization when trained through meta-learning for compositionality (MLC), a new method for optimizing the compositional skills of neural networks through practice. With MLC, a neural network can match human performance and solve several machine learning benchmarks. Given this work, we’ll discuss the paths forward for building machines that learn, generalize, and interact in more humanlike ways based on more natural input. Speaker Biography: Brenden M.

Modern Algorithms for Massive Graphs: Structure and Compression Ben Moseley, Carnegie Mellon University View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series February 1, 2024 Abstract: This talk will discuss the area of algorithms with predictions, also known as learning-augmented algorithms. These methods parameterize algorithms with machine-learned predictions, enabling the algorithms to tailor their decisions to input distributions and to allow for improved performance on runtime, space, or solution quality. This talk will discuss recent developments on how to leverage machine-learned predictions to improve the runtime efficiency of algorithms for optimization and data structures. The talk will also discuss how to achieve “instance-optimal” algorithms when the predictions are accurate and the algorithm’s performance gracefully degrades when there are errors in the predicted advice. The talk will illustrate via examples such as bipartite matching the potential of the area to realize significant performance improvements for algorithm efficiency. Speaker Biography: Ben Moseley is the Carnegie-Bosch Associate Professor of Operations Research at Carnegie Mellon University and is a consulting scientist at Relational AI.

Normativity and the AI Alignment Problem Gillian Hadfield, University of Toronto, School of Law View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series January 25, 2024 Abstract: The alignment problem in AI is currently framed in a variety of ways: It is the challenge of building AI systems that do as their designers intend, or as their users prefer, or as would benefit society. In this talk Gillian Hadfield connects the AI alignment problem to the far more general problem of how humans organize cooperation societies. From the perspective of an economist and legal scholar, alignment is the problem of how to organize society to maximize human well-being—however that is defined. Hadfield will argue that “solving” the AI alignment problem is better thought of as the problem of how to integrate AI systems, especially agentic systems, into our human normative systems. She will present results from collaborations with computer scientists that begin the study of how to build normatively competent AI systems—AI that can read and participate in human normative systems—and normative infrastructure that can support AI’s normative competence. Probabilistic Methods for Designing Functional Protein Structures Brian Trippe, Columbia University Computer Science Seminar Series January 23, 2024 Abstract: The biochemical functions of proteins, such as catalyzing a chemical reaction or binding to a virus, are typically conferred by the geometry of only a handful of atoms. This arrangement of atoms, known as a motif, is structurally supported by the rest of the protein, referred to as a scaffold. A central task in protein design is to identify a diverse set of stabilizing scaffolds to support a motif known or theorized to confer function. This long-standing challenge is known as the motif-scaffolding problem. In this talk, Brian Trippe describes a statistical approach he has developed to address the motif-scaffolding problem. His approach involves (1) estimating a distribution supported on realizable protein structures and (2) sampling scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a motif. For the first step, he adapts diffusion generative models to fit example protein structures from nature. For the second step, he develops sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to sample from the conditional distributions of these models. He finally describes how, with experimental and computational collaborators, he has generalized and scaled this approach to generate and experimentally validate hundreds of proteins with various functional specifications. Speaker Biography: Brian Trippe is a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University in the Department of Statistics and a visiting researcher at the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. He completed his PhD in computational and systems biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked on Bayesian methods for inference in high-dimensional linear models. In his research, Trippe develops statistical machine learning methods to address challenges in biotechnology and medicine, with a focus on generative modeling and inference algorithms for protein engineering. Towards an Open Mobile Networking Ecosystem Mahesh Marina, University of Edinburgh View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series January 18, 2024 Abstract: Mobile (cellular) networks traditionally have been closed systems, developed as vertically integrated, black-box appliances by a few equipment vendors and deployed by a handful of national-scale mobile network operators in each country—all in all, a small ecosystem. However, we have witnessed a radical transformation in the design and deployment of mobile networking systems in the recent past that reflects a path toward greater openness. In this talk, Marina will give his perspective on the key drivers, economic and beyond, behind this trend and the main enablers for this transformation. He will complement this by outlining his key research contributions in this direction. Further, he will highlight two of his recent works: (1) on rearchitecting the mobile core control plane for efficient cloud-native operation and to be more open (i.e., better suited for multi-vendor realization); and (2) on radio access network root cause analysis as a key challenge for Open RAN, as well as a compelling use case of the AI-powered and data-driven operations it enables. Speaker Biography: Mahesh Marina is a professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, where he leads the Networked Systems Research Group. He is currently spending his sabbatical time at the Johns Hopkins University’s Department of Computer Science as a visiting professor. Previously, Marina was a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and AI, for five years, 2018–2023; he also served as the director of the Institute for Computing Systems Architecture within Informatics@Edinburgh for four years, until July 2022. Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, Marina had a two-year postdoctoral stint at the UCLA Computer Science Department after earning his PhD in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He has previously held visiting researcher positions at ETH Zurich and at Ofcom, the UK’s telecommunications regulator, at its headquarters in London. Marina is an ACM Distinguished Member and an IEEE Senior Member. Securing 5G Against Fragile and Malicious Infrastructure Alex Marder, Johns Hopkins University View the recording >> Institute for Assured Autonomy & Computer Science Seminar Series January 16, 2024 Abstract: In early 2020, the U.S. government revealed its belief that China might be able to eavesdrop on 5G communications through Huawei network equipment. This has enormous ramifications for DOD and State Department communications overseas, since these backdoors could provide our adversaries with information that allows them to glean insights into operations or harm personnel. Later that same year, wired and wireless networks in the greater Nashville area failed when a bomb damaged a single network facility. The outage affected nearly every aspect of modern society, including grounding flights, disrupting economic activity, and disconnecting 911. These two events highlight the enormous challenge of securing critical communications: We need to secure our communications against threats within the telecommunications infrastructure and secure it from external attack. This talk will discuss both of these challenges. First, Marder will use the Nashville outage as a blueprint to show that it remains surprisingly easy for attackers to induce large-scale communications outages around the U.S. without any insider information or specialized access. Second, he will discuss innovative methods for identifying and circumventing the potential threats placed by nation-state adversaries within the infrastructure, along with methods for ensuring that communications only traverse benign infrastructure. Speaker Biography: Alex Marder is an assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Institute for Assured Autonomy. Marder’s research covers a wide breadth of networking areas, including the use of empirical analyses and machine learning to evaluate and improve the security and performance of wired and wireless networks. His current work leverages a deep understanding of network architecture and deployment to design secure 5G communication networks for the Department of Defense, reveal security weaknesses in domestic internet access networks, and provide a better understanding of broadband inequity. He received a BS from Brandeis University and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, he was a research scientist at CAIDA at UC San Diego. Computational Methods for Human Networks and High-Stakes Decisions Serina Yongchen Chang, Stanford University View the recording >> Computer Science Speaker Series December 5, 2023 Abstract: In an interconnected world, effective policymaking increasingly relies on understanding large-scale human networks. However, there are many challenges to understanding networks and how they impact decision-making, including (1) how to infer human networks, which are typically unobserved, from data; (2) how to model complex processes, such as disease spread, over networks and inform decision-making; and (3) how to estimate the impacts of decisions, in turn, on human networks. In this talk, I’ll discuss how I’ve addressed each of these challenges in my research. I’ll focus mainly on COVID-19 pandemic response as a concrete application, where we’ve developed new methods for network inference and epidemiological modeling, and have deployed decision-support tools for policymakers. I’ll also touch on other network-driven challenges, including political polarization and supply chain resilience. Formal Verification of Financial Algorithms with Imandra Grant Passmore, Imandra Inc. View the recording >> Institute for Assured Autonomy & Computer Science Seminar Series November 14, 2023 Abstract: Many deep issues plaguing today’s financial markets are symptoms of a fundamental problem: The complexity of algorithms underlying modern finance has significantly outpaced the power of traditional tools used to design and regulate them. At Imandra, we have pioneered the application of formal verification to financial markets, where firms like Goldman Sachs, Itiviti, and OneChronos already rely upon Imandra’s algorithm governance tools for the design, regulation, and calibration of many of their most complex algorithms. With a focus on financial infrastructure (e.g., the matching logics of national exchanges and dark pools), we will describe the landscape and illustrate our Imandra system on a number of real-world examples. We’ll sketch many open problems and future directions along the way. Speaker Biography: Grant Passmore is the co-founder and co-CEO of Imandra Inc. Passmore is a widely published researcher in formal verification and symbolic Al and has more than fifteen years of industrial formal verification experience. He has been a key contributor to the safety verification of algorithms at Cambridge, Carnegie Mellon, Edinburgh, Microsoft Research, and SRI. He earned his PhD on automated theorem proving in algebraic geometry from the University of Edinburgh, is a graduate of UT Austin (BA in mathematics) and the Mathematical Research Institute in the Netherlands (master class in mathematical logic), and is a life member of Clare Hall, University of Cambridge. Side Channel Attacks: Lessons Learned or Troubles Ahead? Daniel Genkin, Georgia Institute of Technology View the recording >> Computer Science Seminar Series October 19, 2023 Abstract: The security and architecture communities will remember the past five years as the era of side channels. Starting from Spectre and Meltdown, time and again we have seen how basic performance-improving features can be exploited to violate fundamental security guarantees. Making things worse, the rise of side channels points to a much larger problem, namely the presence of large gaps in the hardware-software execution contract on modern hardware. In this talk, I will give an overview of this gap, in terms of both security and performance. First, I will give a high-level survey on speculative execution attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. I will then talk about how speculative attacks are still a threat to both kernel and browser isolation primitives, highlighting new issues on emerging architectures. Next, from the performance perspective, I will discuss new techniques for microarchitectural code optimizations, with an emphasis on cryptographic protocols and other compute-heavy workloads. Here I will show how seemingly simple, functionally equivalent code modifications can lead to significant changes in the underlying microarchitectural behavior, resulting in dramatic performance improvements. The talk will be interactive and include attack demonstrations. Speaker Biography: Daniel Genkin is an Alan and Anne Taetle Early Career Associate Professor at the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech. Daniel’s research interests are in hardware and system security, with particular focus on side channel attacks and defenses. Daniel’s work has won the Distinguished Paper Award at IEEE Security and Privacy, an IEEE Micro Top Pick, and the Black Hat Pwnie Awards, as well as top-3 paper awards in multiple conferences. Most recently, Daniel has been part of the team performing the first analysis of speculative and transient execution, resulting in the discovery of Spectre, Meltdown, and follow-ups. Daniel has a PhD in computer science from the Technion Israel’s Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Maryland. Towards Rigorously Tested & Reliable Machine Learning for Health Michael Oberst, Carnegie Mellon University View the recording >> Institute for Assured Autonomy & Computer Science Seminar Series October 17, 2023 Abstract: How do we make machine learning as rigorously tested and reliable as any medication or diagnostic test? ML has the potential to improve decision-making in health care, from predicting treatment effectiveness to diagnosing disease. However, standard retrospective evaluations can give a misleading sense for how well models will perform in practice. Evaluation of ML-derived treatment policies can be biased when using observational data, and predictive models that perform well in one hospital may perform poorly in another. In this talk, I will introduce new tools to proactively assess and improve the reliability of machine learning in healthcare. A central theme will be the application of external knowledge, including review of patient records, incorporation of limited clinical trial data, and interpretable stress tests. Throughout, I will discuss how evaluation can directly inform model design. Speaker Biography: Michael Oberst is an incoming assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins and is currently a postdoc in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on making sure that machine learning in health care is safe and effective, using tools from causal inference and statistics. His work has been published at a range of machine learning venues (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, KDD), including work with clinical collaborators from Mass General Brigham, NYU Langone, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He has also worked on clinical applications of machine learning, including work on learning effective antibiotic treatment policies (published in Science Translational Medicine ). He earned his undergraduate degree in Statistics at Harvard and his PhD in computer science at MIT. Archive From the calendar years 1997–2023.

Most students apply for the program in their junior year and finish both degrees within five years. It is not necessary for your undergraduate major and your master’s degree to be in the exact same field. For example, many computer science undergraduates choose the concurrent program to get a Master of Science in Security Informatics . Mixing degrees is also an alternative to undertaking a double major in a closely-related field, such as a combination of computer science and computer engineering or math. As a combined degree student , you must satisfy all the requirements of your bachelor’s degree as well as all the requirements of your master’s degree. Please note that some departments may permit an overlap of two courses at most. All other courses, including undergraduate electives, must be separate and distinct for the two degrees. BS/MSE Eligibility Students enrolled at JHU as second-semester third-years or rising fourth-years, as well as transfer students who may fall into any of these categories, are eligible to apply to the combined program. The Whiting School of Engineering requires that: An undergraduate student apply to combined student status no later than by the application deadline of the first semester of their fourth year (typically a student’s seventh semester, or in other words, their second-to-last semester of undergraduate study), and An undergraduate student be admitted and enrolled by their graduate program no later than the start of their eighth/final undergraduate semester. Seniors in their final semester cannot apply to the combined program, but can apply to the MSE program as a new graduate candidate and will receive the same benefits as students who applied earlier. Application requirements Combined application (NOT the internal graduate option) Two letters of recommendation JHU unofficial transcripts Statement of purpose Resume GRE and TOEFL scores NOT required Deadlines The deadlines to apply are November 15 for the spring and February 15 for the fall. Additional Information Read the FAQ about the combined BS/MS program. Watch a previously recorded information session about the combined BS/MS program. If you are interested in applying for the combined degree program, apply online through the university’s graduate admissions website .

Play background animation Pause background animation Welcome to CS@JHU. I would like to take the start of 2024 to relate some news and highlights from the past year and discuss the future of our community. 2023 was an incredibly exciting year in the discipline as we learned to live, learn, teach, and research using large language models and other foundational artificial intelligence. AI can be a beneficial technology. At JHU, we use it to enhance doctor-patient interactions , design better surgical robotics methods , and build the most efficient multilingual models for machine translation. AI is also incredibly hazardous, capable of reinforcing stereotypes and racism, producing false and dangerous content, and supporting malicious actors in committing fraud, conducting cyberattacks, and practicing plagiarism. Our researchers have tackled critical questions in AI safety and reliability: How can we protect ourselves from AI generating of violent or offensive content ? How do we ensure that AI produces factual responses that are grounded in observed data? How do we prevent AI from reinforcing racism and sexism ? CS@JHU remains at the forefront of innovation. I am proud to report that two JHU research teams earned spots on TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023 : Professor Suchi Saria uses AI to predict the risk of sepsis before human clinicians can even observe symptoms, while recent PhD graduate Zhaoshou “Max” Li and Professors Mathias Unberath and Russell Taylor collaborated with NVIDIA to create a neural algorithm that reconstructs three-dimensional objects from smartphone videos . We are also evolving how we conduct research and translate discoveries into practice, collaborating with industry partners to ensure that we’re working on the most important problems and that our solutions contribute value to society. The Amazon Initiative for Interactive AI gives fellowships to students and awards grants to faculty to work with Amazon researchers to better understand natural language, improve image-based web search, and enhance virtual commerce. We are also proud to work with Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures and the Pava Marie LaPere Center for Entrepreneurship to foster local entrepreneurship. Last year, we introduced the Singhal Family Entrepreneurship Award , which helps launch student-run software ventures. The CS department continues to grow in size, quality, and diversity. Our community includes more than 700 undergraduate majors, 200 PhD students, 200 master’s students, 35 tenure-track faculty, and eight teaching faculty. Over the next five years, we plan to double the size of our research community as part of a historic commitment by JHU to build the nation’s foremost destination for research in data science, machine learning, and AI. We encourage you to explore how you might participate in CS@JHU. Our website provides a good introduction to our research and education programs. I invite you to contact or visit us directly if you have additional questions, have a vision of how to join or partner with us, or just want to learn more.

MSE Research MSE Research Project/Essay/Thesis Master’s students in the Department of Computer Science have the option to complete their MSE degree requirements with 10 courses OR 8 courses and a research project/essay/thesis. The project is a fantastic opportunity for students to contribute to a body of knowledge while gaining meaningful collaborative research experience. On average, a project will take 1–2 semesters to complete. All of the details of a project are determined by and discussed between the student and their individual project advisor. The department requires that the Master’s Qualifying Project Agreement Form is completed and on file BEFORE the research begins. A commonly asked question is “What is the difference between the project, essay, and thesis?” Quite frankly, not much in most cases. Project/essay/thesis language is used interchangeably, but if there is a differentiating factor, it would be that a thesis is filed through the Electronic Theses & Dissertations process via the Sheridan Libraries. (Please contact Library Services directly for details.) While this is rarely done with master’s “projects,” it remains an option. The final deliverable will be determined by an individual’s project advisor. Below are the steps for MSE students completing a project: Consider your own interests. Seek out a faculty/project advisor with similar interests who has a primary, secondary/joint appointment or research faculty in the Department of Computer Science. Projects may not be completed with a faculty member just because they teach at JHU. Determine the specifics of the project with your faculty/project advisor. Complete the Master’s Qualifying Project Agreement Form and follow its instructions to send the form to the department before the project commences. When the project is finalized per the stipulations of the agreement form, send the signed and completed Qualifying Project Form (different than the agreement form) to the department’s Master’s Academic Program Manager and Senior Academic Program Coordinator. To assist in this process, one of our very own CS professors wrote an extensive guide titled “ How to Do Research with a Professor .” It will provide you with the tools you need to understand the full relationships for all parties involved in a collaborative research effort. For best results, start this process early in your graduate journey to responsibly manage your coursework and project demands.

Graduation – MSE students When approaching the completion of the master’s program, please note that the date of conferral and graduation (attending commencement) are two separate events. Degree Conferral Conferring a degree is a process managed by the CS Department to ensure that all MSE program requirements have been met by a specified conferral date for graduating students. Each semester, detailed instructions are sent out to students to provide documentation for review by the department and then submitted to the WSE Dean’s Office for final approval. Commencement and Celebrations Although degrees are conferred in the fall and spring, there is only one Johns Hopkins Commencement ceremony , which is held in the spring. Please review the commencement website for details, contact information, and FAQs. The CS Department hosts a separate reception for its graduates and their family and friends. Invitations are sent out mid-spring. PhD Defense PhD students should coordinate with their dissertation committee to schedule their defense. Once scheduled, email the PhD Academic Program Manager with a high-resolution photo and the following information: Date & Time of Defense: Advisor(s): Dissertation Title: Abstract: Biography: Professional Plans: Personal Website: Dissertation Zoom Link: After you pass your defense and finalize your dissertation edits, your advisor(s) will prepare your Reader’s Letter, signed by all committee members. You shouldn’t submit your dissertation to the library until the Academic Program Manager has this letter. Once the Academic Program Manager has your Reader’s Letter, you may submit your dissertation to the library. Please see submission details here . There is a $60 ETD submission fee that the CS Department will cover. When you are ready to submit, please contact the Academic Program Manager to arrange a funds transfer. You will receive an email confirmation from etd-support@jhu.edu indicating that your dissertation was approved by the library. Forward that approval email to the Academic Program Manager for conferral processing. Graduation – PhD students Please complete this checklist in order to graduate: Apply to graduate in SIS. Go to your SIS Self-Service drop-down menu and choose Registration, Program of Study, and Apply to Graduate. Then complete all required fields and click SUBMIT. (Lots of students forget this part!)

Example projects include: More than 80 known types of autoimmune disorder afflict up to 50 million Americans, an estimated 5-8% of the population. A significant challenge in treating individuals with these conditions is that disease presentation varies greatly across individuals. By using electronic health data captured over decades from tracking individuals with these diseases, the goals for this project are to develop methods to enable caregivers to tailor treatment options to each individual. Primary investigators: Suchi Saria, John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science; Antony Rosen, Professor of Medicine and Rheumatology; Michelle Petri, Professor of Medicine and Rheumatology; Scott Zeger, Professor of Biostatistics Can one reliably infer changes in health status using symptom data captured via sensors embedded within phones? The goals of this project are to understand how smartphones can be used in everyday settings to monitor health in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. This project will involve developing novel methods for measuring an individual’s health status over time and methods for individualizing interventions. Primary investigators: Suchi Saria, John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science; Ray Dorsey, Professor of Neurology University of Rochester Can we use large-scale population databases to measure the effects of interventions on individuals? The goal of this project will be to develop novel statistical methods for individualizing diagnosis and treatment decisions and for evaluating the causal effects of interventions on children’s health outcomes.

Play background animation Pause background animation Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law, or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies. Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without permission, improper use of the internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment. If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such as your textbook or online resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, group projects must list everyone who participated. Falsifying program output or results is prohibited. Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible; (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA, or CAs—as you are always encouraged to do—rather than from other students; and (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received. On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: “I agree to complete this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials, or device. [Signed and dated].” Your course instructors will let you know where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.
