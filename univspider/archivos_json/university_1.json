Academics / Masters Programs MPCS FAQs Please review the below MPCS frequently asked questions. Still have questions? Email us at mpcs-admissions@lists.uchicago.edu MPCS Application Related Questions Collapse All Expand All I don't have a background in Computer Science, but I'm interested in applying to the program. Will that affect my chances of admission? The MPCS is unique among top CS programs in that we do not require an undergraduate background in computer science. Students join our program with a wide variety of backgrounds. The MPCS is highly competitive and highly quantitative in nature, and as such, during the application review process, we look for evidence of strong quantitative abilities in the form of previous coursework and GRE/GMAT quantitative scores. While we do not have a minimum GPA requirement or minimum GRE/GMAT test score requirement, successful applicants to the MPCS have demonstrated strong quantitative ability with scores on the quantitative section of the exam above the 80th percentile. Can I make changes to my online application after it has been submitted? If you wish to add new material, such as grades from a recent semester or quarter, you may do so by uploading them through the “Other Miscellaneous Documents” section of your online account. If you have submitted erroneous information, or if you believe there has been a technical or formatting error that occurred during your application’s submission, please contact us directly. I've sent my official test scores to the Univeristy of Chicago, but my scores are still listed as missing on my application summary. Why have my test scores not been verified on my online application? Test scores can take up to 7-10 business days (and sometimes longer) to reach us after you submit them. Please be patient. If you believe your test scores have already been received by the university and should have been verified, please contact UChicago GRAD at gradadmissions@uchicago.edu Please include in the email: your reference number and any information you have regarding how/when the official score was sent. For the GRE and TOEFL, the batch number from ETS is usually helpful, as is information on any possible mismatches in how your name, email address, or other data may appear between your application account and your test scores. For the IELTS, we will need the TRF code. Can I use a letter service for subitting letters of reccommendation, such as Interfolio? If you are using a letter service to submit letters of recommendation, such as Interfolio, that should work fine so long as you are using a verified service. Please note that they must be able to be verified as coming directly from the recommender, and you must rescind your right to view the letters before they are sent. Is there a minimum GPA requirement to apply to the MPCS? The MPCS does not have a minimum GPA requirement — stronger emphasis is placed on the quantitative GRE/GMAT score and individual grades in quantitative classes, rather than a cumulative GPA. Can I apply to both the Pre-Doctoral Program and the 9-Course or 12-Course Specialization MS Program? No. You can only apply to one MPCS Program of Study at a time. Applications to the Pre-Doctoral program WILL NOT be reviewed for the MS in Computer Science program. If you apply to both programs, only the Pre-Doc application will be reviewed. If you apply to the Pre-Doc program in Round 1 and are not admitted, you can apply to the MS in Computer Science Full-Time program in Round 2. How and when will I be notified of the admissions committee decision? You will receive your admissions decision by the Notification date listed on the Application Deadlines page. You may also check your application status via the online application system . How do I appeal an admissions decision? Decisions made by the admissions committee are final and not subject to appeal or revision . If I am denied in Round 1, can I re-apply to Round 2? If you are denied during the Round 1 application deadline, you may not re-apply for the Round 2 application deadline. If you are denied during any application deadline, you must wait until the next application year to submit a new application. MPCS Program Related Questions Collapse All Expand All How long will it take to complete my degree? The key to getting the most out of your time commitment is to choose between full-time and part-time options depending on your other obligations. The full-time program allows a student to complete the program within one year, while the part-time program gives more flexibility for working students. Full-time students are able to complete the 9-course MS in 9 months and the 12-course MS in 15 months. The part-time program can be completed at your own pace, with most students completing the program within 18 months to 2 years. Can I pursue my degree part-time or full-time? Students can choose to apply to the MPCS as a full-time or a part-time student. A full-time course load is three (3) classes per quarter. Part-time is one-two (1-2) classes per quarter. Changes to enrollment status need to be approved by the MPCS administration. Please note: Students who will require a student visa to study at any point during thier time in the MPCS must apply to the full-time program and must maintain a full-time course load of at least three (3) classes per quarter. Part-time students are not eligible for a student visa. Are masters students eligible for teaching/research assistantships? All TA/RA positions are reserved for students in the PhD program. What is the cost of tuition? Tuition for the Masters Program in Computer Science is $6,593 USD per course for the 2023-24 academic year. Please consult The University of Chicago’s Bursars Office for complete tuition information. Where are classes held and how often do classes meet? MPCS courses are held on the main campus of the University of Chicago located in Hyde Park, approximately eight (8) miles south of downtown Chicago. Unless specifically noted on the course schedule, most classes meet once per week from 5:30 PM – 8:30 PM. Can I transfer credits from another institution? The MPCS does not allow the transfer of credits from any other graduate program. Do you offer financial support to MS students? The MPCS offers very a limited number of merit-based, partial-tuition scholarships, and no full-tuition scholarships. Students are automatically considered for scholarships at the time of admission and there is not a separate application to be considered. The majority of funds in the CS Department are reserved for CS PhD Students. Any students interested in need based financial aid can contact the UChicago Grad Financial Aid Office . The Student Loan Administration has some helpful information regarding the cost of attendance and living in Chicago during your graduate study. We encourage all international students to investigate outside sources of aid, including programs within their home nation, as well as organizations such as EducationUSA the Institute of International Education and International Education Financial Aid . Further information about educational funding can be found here . What degree will I receive on my diploma? Students completing the program earn a Master of Science in Computer Science . The degree is awarded by the University of Chicago through the Division of Physical Sciences, Department of Computer Science. What is the difference between the 9-course program and the 12-course program? The 12-course program is designed for students who are interested in seeking further specialization beyond our regular 9-course program . Students in the 12-course program can take additional classes in one of the following five specializations: Application Development Data Analytics High Performance Computing Software Engineering The additional specialization will offer a stronger professional skill set and the opportunity for an internship or research project. Can I take classes in other departments in the University and have them count toward my degree? As part of the MPCS degree, students may request to take the following types of classes outside of the MPCS: Coursework in the CS department, such as upper undergraduate level (20000) and PhD level (30000) classes. Up to two (2) courses from non-CS PSD graduate level courses or courses from other graduate divisions and schools (e.g., Booth School of Business). No previous coursework prior to entering the program will be considered towards your degree. Please refer to the Courses outside the MPCS policy. What is the difference between a research-based and applied curriculum? Graduate programs in computer science can either be theory-focused or skills-focused. Theory is meant for students interested in research. Skills-focused is designed for students interested in a professional career in the field. University of Chicago’s Masters Program in Computer Science is highly skills-focused. For a person interested in a computer science career it is important to select a program that focuses on a wide range of applied skills. The MPCS curriculum represents a realistic balance between the foundation courses and the applied courses. We are always adding new and innovative courses to keep up with the fast-paced world of IT, including courses in Software Engineering, Big Data, Data Analytics, High Performance Computing, Information Security, Application Development, Web Development and Cloud Computing.

Academics / Masters Programs / MPCS Spotlight Dheeraj Bandaru, MPCS Student MPCS Student Competes in Social New Venture Challenge For University of Chicago graduate student Dheeraj Bandaru, resourcefulness is a natural route to innovative success. Blending his passions for computer science and paying it forward, Bandaru created a business model to sell major cities’ food supply surplus via food trucks to underserved populations. After extensive networking, discussions, and conceptualizing, a team composed of UChicago graduate students (MPCS Students: Dheeraj Bandaru & Andy Rodriguez; and UChicago Grad Student Katie O’Brien) and their close associates founded the enterprising Social New Venture Challenge business plan, Stoked . Starting in undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, Bandaru’s initial linking of computer science and sustainable business paved a foundation for his inventive ideas while interning for Atlanta’s City Planning Department. A major issue in Atlanta, and other major cities across the United States, is wasted food supply surplus; yet, there is an alarming amount of the US population going hungry. Bandaru understood the fundamental issue at hand: the supply chain isn’t built to move food waste to people who need food. In order to create a business plan to feed underserved Atlanta populations using farmers’ gleaning crops, Bandaru initially reflected on his experience as a member of Georgia Tech’s chapter of the Food Recovery Network . Bandaru considered a similar non-profit approach to feeding underserved communities, however, to organize a more expansive and profitable approach to the gleaning crop, food insecure blunder, a for profit business was the more realistic and achievable choice. Implementing a for profit plan allows for reinvestment, expansion, and ultimately, a more timely solution to gleaning crop expiration. Brainstorming efficient and practical business ideas, Bandaru and former co-founder of Common Moon , Sanjeeth Rajaram found a solution: food trucks. According to Bandaru, Stoked is a “restaurant group of food trucks that is a social mission minded for profit company.” Though for profit may not be deemed the socially conscious approach to feeding underserved populations, the Stoked team found that competing against non-profits for grants and donations would not provide immediate support for their rapidly growing goals. As a for profit organization, Bandaru explains, “[Stoked] is socially focused, in that we’re trying to serve underserved communities.” When considering their target market, the Stoked team wanted to focus on a population often overlooked; those considered above the federal poverty line, but earning less than the cost of living. Bandaru continues, “they have to be served differently than the way food banks or other nonprofits are attempting to do it.” For the Stoked team, Bandaru in particular, the passions for CS, learning, and social change intersect, fueling inspiration for this SNVC business model with a social mission. Stoked partnered with Aztec Dave’s, a familiar food truck that is often stationed at University of Chicago, to run a pilot of their business plan. Plan on visiting the Stoked team on May 12th between 11:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on 58th Street & Ellis Ave. Follow the Stoked team as they compete on May 23, 2023 for up to $150,000 toward their venture in the final round of the Social New Venture Challenge.

Academics / Masters Programs / MPCS Spotlight Ankit Jaini, Joint MBA/MPCS Class of 2020 Ankit Jaini graduated from the Joint MBA/MPCS Program in 2020. He is currently a Product Manager at WhatsApp (Meta). In his alumni profile he reflects on his time in the Joint Program, shares his experience working as a PM, and what advice he would give to those considering the Joint Degree. Can you tell us about your career roles postgraduation?  What do you like about your role as a PM? I’m currently a product manager at WhatsApp in Meta – a messaging product used by billions every day to stay connected with family, friends and businesses! I work on business messaging at WhatsApp, specifically on how we scale our business monetization efforts while preventing spam on the platform. Before Meta I was leading product Twilio which is a SaaS (software as a service) company providing communication infrastructure for developers to build on top of, essentially helping biz communicate with their users. I worked on building machine-learning based products there to enable businesses to increase their customer engagement through various communication channels such as SMS/email/WhatsApp. As a product manager, seeing people using and loving the product I helped build gives me a lot of purpose. One can tangibly see the real world impact of the work and working at companies at Twilio and now WhatsApp – used by millions even billions around the world – the impact one has on people’s lives is remarkable! I love that about my job as a product manager. Post-graduation, you’ve worked at leading technology companies. Can you tell us a bit about what your job search was like as a Joint Student? Do you believe your Joint Degree has helped you in your career? Post-graduation, I have been fortunate enough to lead teams at Twilio (largest SMS/Email provider in the world) and WhatsApp (the largest messaging app in the world). My first role as a Product Manager at Twilio was fairly technical as Twilio is a developer-first company. A rounded understanding of how APIs work, how machine learning models such as neural networks work, and being able to think like a developer so I could build products they love helped me stand out during my application. I’d give a lot of credit to the Joint degree. I focused on both software engineering and machine learning courses during my program – which along with my business skills – gave me a massive leg up. The CS program gave me so much exposure to these technical concepts and a foundational grounding in software and machine learning skills, which helped me demonstrate my technical acumen during the application process but importantly actually be successful at my job! As a PM, your ability to understand technical architecture and know what’s under the hood so you can help your team make the right product decisions is invaluable. It also ensures you can collaborate with your engineering team at a much deeper level and gain their trust which is critical to execute well on product development What interested you in applying to the Joint Program after being admitted to the Booth MBA Program? Did you have previous CS experience? Before grad school, I was working on my own tech startup in India. That was really my first foray into product development and made me realize the importance of technical education and how much I could increase my leverage if I understood technology deeply. Uchicago’s joint program is one of the few programs where you are offered the flexibility to shape your MBA and CS program to your needs – barring foundational courses, I could choose what courses I wanted to pursue and when, design my workload to suit my ambitions and finish the joint program in the same time as a usual Full-time MBA program. Both these things combined made the joint program an ideal fit for me. I did not have formal CS education from undergrad but I taught myself how to code during my startup days. That background along with interest in software and motivation to pursue a career long term in technology was what drove me to choose the Joint program. What was one of your favorite experiences (class/project/etc.) as a Joint Student? One big reason I enjoyed the joint program so much was the range of diverse topics I was able to dive into – from history and business to entrepreneurship to technology and coding! It’s hard to choose just one so here is one from each program: I loved the cloud computing class from the MPCS program as it was a great combination of theory and hands-on project practice. We dug deep into web application architecture, cloud storage and computation and how to scale our web apps using relevant industry tools such as Amazon web services (AWS). We capped it off by building our own end-to-end web app as part of the capstone project! From the MBA program, my favorite course was ‘Business in Historical Perspective’ – where we explored how businesses have succeeded and failed in diverse contexts throughout history. I am always pleasantly surprised by historical patterns repeating over time and how much we can learn from that. Would you recommend the Joint Program to recently admitted Booth MBA students? If so, why? I derived outsized value from the Joint program and recommend strongly considering it as part of the MBA experience. If you are interested in pursuing a career in a technology-driven industry, or in a technical (or technical-adjacent) role such as a product manager, software engineering, data scientist, etc – then the joint program is a no-brainer. The program gives you the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the rapidly changing landscape of technology and business, and prepares you to take on leadership roles in these industries. And there is really no previous coding experience required – just the motivation to learn. My class had a mix of both newbies with no previous coding experience as well as folks who had pursued CS in undergrad. However, it’s important to consider your own interests and career goals. If you are primarily interested in a career in business fields, such as consulting or finance, then the joint program may not be as beneficial. Additionally, it’s important to consider the time and effort required to complete the joint program – you do have to ruthlessly prioritize your time and the rigor required is real! But it can be so rewarding 🙂 John Crerar Library Building 5730 South Ellis Avenue Chicago IL 60637 Main: 773.702.6614 cswebmaster@cs.uchicago.edu © 2024 Copyright University of Chicago About Research Academics People News & Events Admission Student Organizations Contact Non-Discrimination Statement Accessibility Get Updates Enter email address Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Academics / Masters Programs / MPCS Spotlight Anna Simmons, Joint MBA/MPCS Class of 2021 The University of Chicago Masters Program in Computer Science students push boundaries and innovate across many facets of industry. Whether it’s developing seamless UX interfaces, engineering software at Fortune 500 companies, working in big data or keeping networks secure, our students use their applied-skills education from the MPCS to problem-solve, create, and elevate the computer science field. Learn from their stories and discover how a CS background can prepare you for cutting-edge internships. Anna Simmons graduated from the Joint MBA/MPCS Program in 2021. She speaks with us about her experience participating in the New Venture Challenge, her role as a product manager at Okta, and her advice for those considering the Joint Program. What interested you in applying to the Joint Program after being admitted to the Booth MBA Program? Did you have previous CS experience? My career before joining the Booth MBA program had been catered around exploring the intersection of business and technology. From my previous roles, I found I really enjoyed how technology and business met in enterprise software, but wanted to change functions to work on building products myself as a product manager. I enrolled in the Booth MBA program to help me hone skills like strategy, finance, sales, marketing, growth, and stakeholder management that would be important to being a good product manager. However, product management sits in between business and technical stakeholders, which is why I wanted to improve my technical skills to be able to collaborate more effectively with technical teams, as well as really think about how I can leverage new technology to create innovative products. I had some computer science background through introductory courses in undergrad, and some exposure working in software implementation, but the MPCS was a great opportunity to really deepen this knowledge. What was one of your favorite experiences as a Joint Student? It is hard to narrow to just one because I really enjoyed the program end-to-end, but I’d have to say Cloud Computing was my favorite course and most directly applicable to my current role as a product manager at a cloud-based software-as-a-service company like Okta. In the course, we were able to build our own cloud web application on Amazon Web Services while learning so much about the applications and theoretical underpinnings of cloud technologies to inform the architectural, design, and implementation decisions for my application. This really gave me a strong foundational understanding of the technology powering the products I work on today, and helps me understand and communicate with the engineers that I work with. It was also genuinely really fun and satisfying too as each part of the application came together. During your time in the Joint Program, you participated in the New Venture Challenge through Polksy – and you and your team won fourth place! Can you tell us a bit about that experience? The New Venture Challenge was such a rewarding experience! The challenge itself allows students to turn ideas into businesses. I was a part of a team of five fellow Booth MBA classmates working on a new company, Resette, that my classmate, Whitney had been ideating and starting working on earlier that year. We built Resette, a direct-to-consumer combination skincare/makeup company designed to help customers wear less products and benefit more through our customized matching process to find their ideal 4-in-1 skincare serum, moisturizer, foundation, and SPF formulation. As part of the challenge, I was in Steve Kaplan’s “Developing a New Venture” course as well where we had in-depth sessions on presentation skills, financial modeling, and legal considerations in a new venture that we leveraged to start the business, build a business plan and refine a product pitch. Throughout the course, we were able to meet with venture capitalists, private investors, and entrepreneurs who helped critique and improve the ideas and businesses during the presentations, as well as connect us with others in the industry who helped us get started and find a co-manufacturer for our product. I was specifically brought onto the team because of my computer science background to support the technology and product side of the business which included building our matching algorithm, website and setting up all technology tools. As a direct-to-consumer product, we are able to reach our customers directly, which gives us a lot of control over the experience we provide our customers, but also means the website and digital experience is extremely important to the brand. We focused on providing a customized yet simple experience for finding the right formula, and I had to evaluate what this means from both a business and technical perspective– evaluating different website hosting and building options as well as designing our matching algorithm, evaluating the inputs we should be gathering, such as photos and skincare needs, with the algorithm to process and provide a match. We were able to win 4th place, which included $96,000 in investment, that Whitney and Veena have now used to turn Resette into daybird.co as they continued the business post-MBA on their own as co-founders. I may be biased, but I definitely recommend checking them out– I use Daybird every morning and am so excited for them to continue to grow. How has your MPCS education helped you achieve your professional goals? I have been a product manager since graduating from the program, working on a fairly technical product at Okta. The skills I gained through the MPCS coursework have really helped me to be successful in this role. I’m able to collaborate with the engineers on my team, better understand technical users of my products, and really understand the solutions we are building. Additionally, from my experience in the New Venture Challenge and the broader Joint MBA/MPCS program, I have a better understanding of early technology companies and the ecosystem around them and how I can contribute. At Okta, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a brand new offering which has been like a startup within a larger company and I’ve definitely leaned on my background to help us launch our product successfully. Would you recommend the Joint Program to recently admitted Booth MBA students? If so, why? For prospective MBA students considering the joint program, I’d definitely recommend thinking about your future career goals and what you’re trying to get out of the program to assess if it’s worth the additional time commitment. During an MBA, there’s so many different ways you can spend your time, and it’s important to really think about how you can best use your time in school. If you’re interested in working in a technical or technical adjacent role, I think it’s a phenomenal program that you can really cater to the skills and topics that will be most interesting and useful for you. I know other MPCS/MBA classmates with little computer science background, and those with several years of professional software development experience alike, were able to cater their studies and take away valuable skills from the program. For me personally, without hesitation, I would definitely choose to do the program again– I got everything I was hoping for, and more!

Held annually, CHI brings together experts from academia and industry to present groundbreaking research, share insights, and explore future directions in the field. This year’s conference, CHI 2024, will see a remarkable showcase of innovative research from students and faculty at the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science . Three papers, including one each from Associate Professor Blase Ur’s group, Associate Professor Pedro Lopes’ group, and Associate Professor Marshini Chetty’s group, received best paper awards. Another paper from Lopes’ group also received an honorable mention. Some works, like papers featuring Neubauer Professor Nick Feamster and Associate Professor Marshini Chetty, are also collaborations with faculty from The Law School and the Harris School of Public Policy , highlighting the interdisciplinary work that often takes place in the department. Each paper span a diverse range of topics, including contextual notifications for highlighting fairness and bias in data science, in-depth studies of online content moderation policies, investigations into compliance with privacy regulations, AI for the well-being of workers, the introduction of a design space for writing assistants, groundbreaking advancements in haptic interfaces, and innovative approaches to promoting digital well-being through leveraging material receipts for screen-time reflection. The work reflects the department’s commitment to advancing knowledge and addressing real-world challenges in the realm of computing. Bias In Data Science Best Paper Award Harrison et al., 2024. JupyterLab in Retrograde: Contextual Notifications That Highlight Fairness and Bias Issues for Data Scientists. The paper introduces Retrograde, a JupyterLab extension designed to aid data scientists in considering algorithmic fairness during the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning to model building. Retrograde provides real-time, context-specific notifications to data scientists about decisions impacting fairness, such as using protected classes as predictors, handling missing data, and minimizing demographic differences in model performance. This work underscores the importance of addressing ethical considerations in data science workflows. Although the paper has won an award, the team will be presenting the paper virtually at the conference, rather than traveling to Hawai’i, as a show of solidarity with the community’s protests over the conference’s impact on the local community. Content Moderation Schaffner et al., 2024. Community Guidelines Make This the Best Party on the Internet: An In-Depth Study of Online Platforms’ Content Moderation Policies. PhD student Brennan Schaffner and postdoctoral associate Arjun Bhagoji worked with a team of undergraduates under the advisory of Neubauer Professor Nick Feamster and Associate Professor Marshini Chetty , as well as Assistant Professor Chenhao Tan from the Department of Computer Science and Professor Genevieve Lakier from The Law School, to delve into the intricacies of online content moderation policies. Their in-depth study sheds light on the effectiveness and implications of platform guidelines for fostering healthy online communities. Their data set of user-generated sites’ policies on misinformation, copyright, and hate speech is also available for use by other researchers. Compliance and Privacy Regulations Tran et al., 2024. Measuring Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act Over Space and Time. Feamster and Chetty collaborate once again, this time with Professor Lior Jacob Strahilevitz from the Law School and Edwin A. and Betty L. Bergman Distinguished Service Professor Jens Ludwig from the Harris School of Public Policy. Leading the paper is PhD student Van Tran , who investigates compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act across spatial and temporal dimensions. Their research offers valuable insights into the challenges and patterns of adherence to privacy regulations in the digital age. In particular, their work shows how regulations in California around privacy can create some spillover effects to consumers in other states. AI and Worker’s Well-being Best Paper Award Das Swain et al., 2024. Sensible and Sensitive AI for Worker Wellbeing: Factors that Inform Adoption and Resistance for Information Workers. PhD student Lan Gao partnered with Georgia Institute of Technology and Northeastern University to examine the challenges and potentials of deploying Passive Sensing-enabled AI (PSAI) systems in the workplace for worker’s well-being support. To maximize PSAI’s value in the workplace while addressing worker concerns, the study dissects various components of PSAI and identifies key factors that lead to workers’ adoption and resistance to the system. Through an interactive online survey, the study finds that PSAI systems are more acceptable when sensing digital time use or physical activity rather than visual modes. Workers also show a preference for insights into mental well-being over performance metrics but resist the automatic sharing of these insights. Overall, the study provides valuable information for designing more worker-centered PSAI systems to support worker well-being and acceptance. Design Space for Writing Assistants Lee at el., 2024. A Design Space for Intelligent and Interactive Writing Assistants. Assistant Professor Mina Lee introduces a design space for intelligent and interactive writing assistants. Through community collaboration with 36 researchers from 27 institutions and systematic literature review of 115 papers across multiple disciplines, this work explores five key aspects of writing assistants—task, user, technology, interaction, and ecosystem—and defines 35 dimensions (i.e., fundamental components of each aspect) and 143 codes (i.e., options for each dimension) as part of the design space. This work provides researchers and designers a practical reference to help them navigate, comprehend, and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid them in the design of new writing assistants. Pushing Boundaries in Haptic Interfaces Best Paper Award Nith et al., 2024. SplitBody: Reducing Mental Workload while Multitasking via Muscle Stimulation. Honorable Mention Tanaka et al., 2024. Haptic Source-effector: Full-body Haptics via Non-invasive Brain Stimulation. Teng et al., 2024. Haptic Permeability: Adding Holes to Tactile Devices Improves Dexterity. Marzursky et al., 2024. Stick&Slip: Altering Fingerpad Friction via Liquid Coatings. The Human-Computer Integration Lab (directed by Associate Professor Pedro Lopes ) makes a significant impact with not one, but four papers showcasing groundbreaking advancements in haptic interfaces: PhD student Romain Nith , together with co-author Yun Ho, proposes that wearables can assist people with physical multitasking—their system can, for instance, guide your hand muscles while you are cooking your meal, letting you free some physical and mental resources for other tasks, such as writing an essay with your other hand. In their CHI 2024 paper, “ SplitBody ” they found that moving the user’s body using electrical muscle stimulation, can alleviate the cognitive load on the user by assisting with repetitive movements. The key insight is that unlike automating tasks externally (e.g., robot arms and other machinery), with a wearable that stimulates one’s own muscles, the user is still involved in the task—giving them a sense of ownership, control and even enjoyment. PhD student Yudai Tanaka , and co-author Jacob Serfaty, propose a completely new concept for haptic devices (e.g., interactive devices that can stimulate the sense of touch and forces, usually for increasing the quality of AR/VR immersion or training). In Yudai’s new concept, instead of having users wear devices that stimulate their skin (resulting in one device per location the user needs to feel haptic sensations), there is only one device atop the user’s brain. Using non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation), this new single device worn in the head is able to create touch or force sensations in many locations of the body (e.g., hands, arms, legs, etc), as they describe in their CHI 2024 paper “ Haptic Source-effector “. Apropos this topic, PhD student Yudai Tanaka is organizing a CHI panel with luminaries in the field of HCI and Neuroscience (e.g., Prof. Pattie Maes from the MIT Media Lab or Prof. Olaf Blanke From the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) to discuss the potential of brain-computer interfaces and brain-stimulation in HCI. PhD student Shan-Yuan Teng , and co-author high school student Aryan Gupta, present “ Haptic Permeability ” in which they’ve found that adding holes to tactile devices (e.g., such as haptic devices that one wears on the finger to create virtual touch sensations) allows users to better grasp and feel objects. This advancement allows us to re-think the way that haptic devices have been engineered so far. Most devices emphasized their ability to create virtual sensations, even at the detriment to decreasing the user’s dexterity in everyday life—imagine trying to shake someone’s hand or type on a keyboard while wearing your haptic VR glove. PhD student Alex Mazursky , and co-author Jacob Serfaty, propose “ Stick&Slip “, a haptic device that allows the user to feel as if the surfaces around them are changing friction. This one-of-a-kind device achieves this effect by delivering small droplets of liquids to the user’s fingerpad, just before finger touches a new surface. As these liquids have been selected for their friction coefficient and rapid evaporation, this creates a sensation of slipping or sticking to the surface. In their 2024 CHI paper they demonstrate how this enables a user to configure their finger pad’s friction in real time, for instance, allowing them a better grip while doing fine movements with a screwdriver. Tangible Intervention for Digital Well-being Sathya et al., 2024. Attention Receipts: Utilizing the Materiality of Receipts to Improve Screen-time Reflection on YouTube. Finally, PhD student Anup Sathya , advised by Assistant Professor Ken Nakagaki from AxLab , presents a paper titled “ Attention Receipts “. Modern media consumption platforms are endlessly useful and entertaining but at the same time, they are designed to maximize user engagement, often against the user’s will. In resistance, Anup designed and engineered a household object that prints receipts, materializing the user’s consumption of YouTube. Utilizing the strong cost metaphor of a receipt allows users to viscerally and critically reflect on what they ‘pay’ attention to. By deploying the object in multiple households and collating experiences from users, the authors discuss the potential of using household objects and affective data physicalization in a digital well-being context. The University of Chicago Department of Computer Science continues to make significant contributions to the field of human-computer interaction, as evidenced by the diverse and impactful research that will be showcased at CHI 2024 in May. These researchers’ papers exemplify the department’s dedication to advancing knowledge, fostering innovation, and addressing pressing societal issues through computing research.

A team of UChicago undergraduates is building a communications satellite smaller than a paper towel roll that will be launched into orbit courtesy of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative. While large satellites like the Hubble Space Telescope are the size of a bus and even “SmallSats” are the size of a refrigerator, CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that can be as tiny as a 10-centimeter cube (roughly four inches). Big science can come from these small devices. The UChicago team’s PULSE-A (Polarization modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment) CubeSat aims to make space-to-ground operations more difficult to intercept and jam, while increasing the speed of communications. “The project that we settled on was building a 10 megabit-per-second space to earth laser downlink,” said PULSE-A Project Director Lauren Ayala , a Molecular Engineering and Astrophysics fourth-year. “We want to take a signal on the satellite and then send it to an optical ground station on the Earth.” Members of the UChicago PULSE-A leadership team. From left, Astrophysics first-year John Baird; Mathematics and Computer Science first-year Parth Bhandari; Molecular Engineering and Astrophysics second-year Logan Hanssler; Molecular Engineering and Astrophysics fourth-year Lauren Ayala; Physics second-year Seth Knights; Astrophysics, Physics, and Computer Science fourth-year Rohan Gupta; and Physics and Philosophy first-year Juan Ignacio Prieto. (Photo provided by PULSE-A) PULSE-A was designed and will be built by a group of 53 University of Chicago undergraduates from the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering , the Physics Department , the Computer Science Department and the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics . Theirs was one of 10 projects from universities across the country selected in the most recent round of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative . Since its inception in 2010, the program has launched more than 150 small research satellites into orbit, helping student-led projects explore the stars. “We are constantly sending information to space with our phones. Space has become so accessible. But there’s something different about thinking how something you design and build is going to space,” said Physics and Philosophy first-year Juan Ignacio Prieto, the head of the optical ground station that will receive PULSE-A’s communications. “We’re shooting data through a laser and that means designing every part of the process and what goes in that laser somehow feels different than what goes in your phone.” Design Radio frequency has long been the typical approach for communications between earth and satellites. The UChicago team opted for lasers in part because of the additional security needed for a communications satellite, Ayala said. “With lasers, you’re dealing with more directionality and you finish with less divergence. This means it’s a lot harder for people to listen and break your encryption,” she said. “Also, it’s a faster means of communication.” NASA has selected a 10x10x23 centimeter “CubeSat” designed by a team of UChicago graduates for launch in late summer 2026. The Polarization modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) aims to make space-to-ground operations more difficult to intercept and jam, while increasing the speed of communications. (Rendering provided by PULSE-A) The satellite will start with laser in space that is modulated to encode data with left- and right-handed polarization. The data will travel 800 km to an optical ground station back on Earth. In November, the group submitted an 80-page proposal to NASA outlining their plans for a 10x10x23 centimeter CubeSat capable of tackling this challenge in a way that’s both space-efficient and, by satellite standards, inexpensive. In March, NASA responded. Their project was among the ones selected to be launched. Although the launch location will be announced 8-12 months prior to launch, many past CSLI projects have launched from the International Space Station. “I had never seen them launch satellites off the ISS,” said PULSE-A Outreach Lead James Passmore , a Physics second-year. “I just saw it on my Instagram feed the other day and I thought, ‘It reminds me of Star Wars.’” Construction Many on the team, including Ayala, will have graduated by the time PULSE-A launches. “We have two and a half years to take the design that we’ve been working on last year and fabricate it ourselves. And then we hand it over to NASA,” Ayala said. NASA will only cover the cost of the launch. The team must build it on their own. (Rendering provided by PULSE-A) Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering Prof. Tian Zhong lent the team a portion of an optical table on which to fabricate the device. Other faculty have pledged to help with system requirement reviews and other advisement needed for such a massive project, the last bits of which must be done in a cleanroom. For the students, it will be an intense and time-consuming learning process. “It’s also very fun,” James said. “I like to describe it as baking instructions. We spent the last year and a half writing the instructions. Now it’s time to bake the cake.” UChicago’s PULSE-A project is expected to launch in late summer 2026.

Po-Ju Chen and Kairong Zhang, two University of Chicago students enrolled in the Masters Program in Computer Science (MPCS), recently won the Apple Swift Student Challenge ; a competition that offers participants an exciting opportunity to demonstrate their skills in Swift programming and app development. Students have the chance to create innovative applications and tackle real-world problems using the Swift language. The winners receive one year of membership in the Apple Developer Program, a complimentary voucher to take an App Development with Swift certification exam, and a special gift from Apple. Chen and Zhang were taking iOS Development, taught by Assistant Professor Andrew Binkowski when they first learned about the challenge. Binkowski encouraged students to submit projects to the Apple Swift Challenge as part of the course. MPCS student, Po-Ju Chen Chen’s background in computer science and desire to utilize technology to improve people’s everyday lives drew him to the challenge. By developing and releasing applications on the App Store, Po-Ju saw an opportunity for his ideas to directly benefit people. “I saw the [Apple Swift Student Challenge] as a wonderful opportunity to fully commit myself to a project,” Chen stated. “I spent considerable time developing something meaningful while adhering to the course’s demands.” For the challenge, he developed a puzzle game titled ‘ Happy Merge: Animal Carnival ’. As Chen is an avid gamer, he has always been curious about the mechanics behind games, and learning to program gave him a newfound understanding into game design and development. “The primary goal of this game is to deliver joy to its players,” Chen said. “It has already garnered a user base, and I plan to continue updating the game to keep providing fun and engagement to my users.” MPCS student, Kairong Zhang Unlike Chen, Zhang did not have a heavy background in computer science before starting her second master’s degree at UChicago. She looked at the challenge as a way to create something that would solve a common problem for herself and other students; breaking into the job market. Zhang developed “Future Express”, an application for students to look at the latest job postings in computer science, data science, and analyst industries. Contrary to existing job platforms, which are cluttered with promotional material, “Future Express” allows students to clearly see the newly posted jobs in chronological order. Students can also request professionals to apply for jobs for them, saving a few hours every day. Future Express layout “This idea solves my own problem,” Zhang says. “CS students experience a really tough market today, especially for international students who require sponsorship to work. Often, we have to apply to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs, before we get an offer. Traditional platforms post the jobs in a company-preferred way, but not the student-preferred way. My approach is to help students like myself land an offer by applying to the most recent jobs for them in the volume and persistence that we cannot do ourselves.” Both students plan to continue working in app development.

D. in Mathematics and Computer Science.” The basic structure is that students must gain admission to both PhD programs and satisfy both sets of course requirements. They write a single dissertation that satisfies both programs. While the program is open to all eligible students, we expect that at least initially it will be most popular among students working in CS Theory, Discrete Mathematics, and Mathematical Logic. Each student in this program will have a primary program (either Mathematics or Computer Science). Throughout the course of studies, the primary program will provide administrative support to the student, including in matters regarding financial support. Admission To be admitted to the joint program, students will have to be admitted by both departments as follows. Application after entering the PhD program Students enrolled in either the Mathematics or the Computer Science PhD program may apply to the joint program during the first four years in their current program. If admitted to the joint program, their current program will be primary. Such an applicant must submit the following material to the Director of Graduate Studies/Graduate Committee Chair of the intended secondary program, while notifying the Director of Graduate Studies/Graduate Committee Chair of the primary program: current CV statement of purpose, explaining why the joint program is the right program for the applicant statement of coursework and research done so far statement of a schedule how the applicant proposes to satisfy the secondary program’s requirements advisor’s recommendation, including endorsement of the applicant’s statements (items 2, 3, 4 above) if the application occurs during the first year of the primary program, the applicant needs to provide two additional letters of recommendation and their undergraduate transcript. It is permitted to reuse material from the application to the primary program. Requirements, monitoring Course requirements Students enrolling in the joint program will need to satisfy the course requirements of both departments. They will have to satisfy the course requirements of their primary program on the schedule of that program, and satisfy the course requirements of their secondary program by the end of their fifth year in the primary program. According to current rules, two of the CS electives can be courses offered by the Mathematics department. These courses are permitted to overlap with the Mathematics course requirements. Exam Requirements Students in the joint program shall fulfill the examination requirements of the primary program; the current list of requirements can be found at Computer Science Requirements Mathematics Requirements For students participating in the joint program, the deadlines for these exams can be relaxed by petitioning the Director of Graduate Studies/Graduate Committee Chair of the primary program. Monitoring student progress Students’ annual progress reports go to both departments’ Director of Graduate Studies/Graduate Committee Chair in accordance with each department’s format. PhD dissertation and defense Subject of the dissertation The dissertation is expected to be in an area relevant to both fields. PhD thesis defense The scheduling of the PhD Thesis defense follows the Mathematics Department’s custom as follows. A nearly final draft of the thesis is made accessible to faculty at least two weeks prior to the defense, either in hard copy in the departmental office or, preferably, by posting on the internet. The dissertation is reviewed in writing by two readers, one of whom is typically the thesis advisor. The reports by the first and the second readers are circulated among faculty of both departments, along with the Thesis abstract and the following information: the location (physical or virtual) where the thesis can be viewed, the planned time and location of the defense, and the names and affiliations of the thesis committee members. There is a two-week period for comments by faculty before the admission of the thesis for defense. The thesis defense itself consist of a 50-minute public presentation of the main results and methods of the dissertation, followed by a public question-answer period, followed by a closed-session question-answer period. Oversight, committees Oversight The program proceeds under joint Math-CS oversight, exercised by the Director of Graduate Studies/Graduate Committee Chair of each department. Examination committees The following rules apply to all examination committees (Qualifying/Topic Exam, Master’s, Candidacy, and PhD). The committee will consist of at least three members, including the student’s advisor(s). It will include at least one member of each department, and will either be chaired by a joint appointee of the two departments or co-chaired by a member of each department. Each department shall publicize these exams in accordance with its established customs.

A central component of the program is the interaction of the student with their research advisor, and with the research community. We expect that throughout the program advisors and students will determine the best course of action within the program, within the general rules below. The PhD program proceeds in three phases: Qualifying Phase : acquire a basis of knowledge, techniques and skills in Computer Science Candidacy Phase : gain admission to candidacy Dissertation Phase : write and defend a dissertation During the first phase, the Qualifying Phase, the students demonstrate knowledge in several fundamental subareas of Computer Science, start doing research, and refine their research interests, including identifying a research advisor. They will also show competence in writing, producing a technical document (a research or survey paper) that indicates that the student is qualified to pursue their studies eventually leading to a doctorate. The Qualifying Phase ends with a public exam, in which the student presents their paper, and answers questions. Success in this Qualifying Exam leads to the next phase where the student is expected to identify a research topic, and start doing research. This phase concludes with a Candidacy Exam, where the student demonstrates to their committee that they have a viable plan for their PhD. After successful completion of the Candidacy Exam the student will continue to do research, obtaining results that constitutes their PhD dissertation. The last phase concludes with a successful thesis defense. Throughout the process, students document successful research in appropriate publications. Exceptions Exceptions to the PhD program requirements will be made only in very extenuating circumstances. Students planning to petition for an exception should first consult their advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies. Minor exceptions require approval of the Graduate Committee. Major exceptions require approval of the entire faculty. No exceptions can be made to University requirements. Maintaining Good Standing To continue to advance through the PhD program, students must maintain good academic standing. In general, good standing means that the student is working actively in the Department’s research community under the guidance of an advisor, and making progress towards completing their dissertation within the allotted time frame. Normally, students conform to the timeline below: Have a research advisor by the end of Summer Quarter, but preferably by the end of Spring Quarter of their first year Complete the coursework for the Qualifying Phase by the end of Spring Quarter of their second year Pass their Qualifying Exam by the end of Autumn Quarter of their third year Pass their Candidacy Exam by the end of the Autumn Quarter of their fifth year Have their Thesis Defense by Spring Quarter of their sixth year. These timeline requirements are automatically extended during approved leaves of absence. Note: Meeting these requirements is the student’s responsibility. Alternative Timelines and Exceptional Circumstances There may be reasons for which students are not best served by the timeline above. In this case, the student and Advisor should submit an alternate plan to the Graduate Committee. The plan should include a new timeline and its justification. A student who has joined the program under special circumstances and a timeline that explicitly differs from the standard 6-year one, will be subject to the timeline specified at their admission. Students with questions may contact Megan Woodward (Student Affairs Administrator), Ben Zhao (Director of Graduate Studies), Bahareh Lampert (Dean of Students in the Physical Sciences Division), or Amanda Young (Associate Director, Graduate Student Affairs) in UChicagoGRAD.

Students then go on to advanced coursework in econometrics, machine learning, big data methods, data visualization, and application development, all while learning how to apply these skills in the policy realm. MSCAPP graduates have become civic technologists, data scientists, and policy researchers bringing modern technology to bear on the societal problems that matter most. MSCAPP students have come from prominent places in governance like the White House and the Japanese Ministry of Finance, non-profit organizations like the World Bank, and technology companies like MongoDB. Still, not all applicants have a background in economics, statistics, or computer science—drive, passion, and intellectual curiosity define the best MSCAPP candidates.

This course takes a technical approach to understanding ethical issues in the design and implementation of computer systems. Tensions often arise between a computer system’s utility and its privacy-invasiveness, between its robustness and its flexibility, and between its ability to leverage existing data and existing data’s tendency to encode biases. The course will demonstrate how computer systems can violate individuals’ privacy and agency, impact sub-populations in disparate ways, and harm both society and the environment. It will also introduce algorithmic approaches to fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability in machine learning systems. Through hands-on programming assignments and projects, students will design and implement computer systems that reflect both ethics and privacy by design. They will also wrestle with fundamental questions about who bears responsibility for a system’s shortcomings, how to balance different stakeholders’ goals, and what societal values computer systems should embed.

It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this... Creating technologies that are inclusive of people in marginalized communities involves more than having technically sophisticated algorithms, systems, and infrastructure. It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this understanding coupled with our knowledge of how people think and behave to design user-facing interfaces that can enhance and augment human capabilities. When dealing with under-served and marginalized communities, achieving these goals requires us to think through how different constraints such as costs, access to resources, and various cognitive and physical capabilities shape what socio-technical systems can best address a particular issue. This course leverages human-computer interaction and the tools, techniques, and principles that guide research on people to introduce you to the concepts of inclusive technology design. You will learn about different underserved and marginalized communities such as children, the elderly, those needing assistive technology, and users in developing countries, and their particular needs. In addition, you will learn how to be mindful of working with populations that can easily be exploited and how to think creatively of inclusive technology solutions. You will also put your skills into practice in a quarter long group project involving the creation of an interactive system for one of the user populations we study.
