Students may focus on one area of computer science, or take courses across the breadth of the field. The degree may be completed on a full-time or part-time basis.For students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field, the requirements can usually be completed over the course of three semesters.We welcome applications from students who did not major in computer science but whose undergraduate work demonstrates strong technical skills.This program is for students who intend to complete their studies at the University of Rochester with an MS degree. Students with an undergraduate degree who wish to get their PhD in computer science at Rochester should apply directly to the PhD program.For application and financial support information see the applying to Rochester page.Program RequirementsStudents must complete a minimum of 30 credits. Of these credits:All courses must be 400/500-level three- or four-credit coursesUp to six hours can be from research credits, supervised by a faculty memberMS students must pass a comprehensive examination (or essay), typically in the last semester before graduation.Some students may need to take one or more 100- or 200-level prerequisite courses. These courses are not counted toward the 30 credit requirement and are typically taken by students who do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science.Courses offered by departments other than computer science but that are relevant to the degree may be included in the 30 hours, subject to approval of the graduate education committee. In any case, at least 18 hours of the 30 must be courses offered by the Department of Computer Science.Students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 by the end of their second semester and throughout the rest of their time in the program, and must obtain a least a 2.0 in each course that counts toward the 30 credit hours.Sample Programs of StudyThese programs are illustrative examples; students may take any program meeting the general requirements above.

The proposal defense constitutes the ‘Ph.D. qualifying exam’ discussed in the University’s Graduate Studies Bulletin and Regulations and Policies Concerning Graduate Studies.Students must perform research that is a significant contribution to the field during their third year. This can be satisfied by:Writing a paper that is accepted in a respectable refereed conference or journalProducing a paper of similar quality (quality of paper judged by the dissertation advisory committee)Incorporating the contribution in the required thesis proposalDissertation Advisor and Preliminary Advisory CommitteeSoon after passing the area process, you should concentrate on narrowing down your interests to more specific ideas, such as:“Truth Maintenance in Natural Language”“Collapsing Complexity Classes via Counting”“Parallel Visual Shape Recognition”“Latency Tolerance in Distributed Shared Memory Systems”Part of this process will be exploring ideas with faculty and finding a dissertation advisor and a preliminary advisory committee.All students must register their dissertation advisor and a preliminary advisory committee with the graduate coordinator no later than December 31 in their third year.Your advisor will play a major role of guiding you through the process of completing a PhD. Your advisor will:Help you in planning your thesis proposal defensePoint you towards to appropriate literatureAdvise proposal-related (and other) researchRead drafts of your proposalGiving general adviceThe advisor also plays a crucial role in the actual exam itself. Choosing an advisor should not be done lightly; changing advisors can significantly delay completion of your studies.The preliminary advisory committee must contain:Your dissertation advisorAt least three University of Rochester faculty members holding the rank of at least assistant professorThree department members**This is a department requirement. Exceptions can be granted by the chair.A faculty member from outside the department can also be included, and must be included when the final dissertation advisory committee is formed in the second term of the third year.Thesis TopicAfter choosing an advisor and a general category, the next step is to decide what you really want to do. This involves finding, with the help of your advisor, a suitable topic.After choosing a topics students should search through literature to answer the following questions:What (if anything) has been done already?What has not been done?What are the major gaps in previous work?What are recognized “next steps”?After you have a grasp of the area and the problem, you will need to outline how your research will address the problem. This outline should include ideas on:How the research will attack the problemWhat it will not attackHow it will fit in with previous workWhat the essential contribution of the work will beYou should be actively engaged in research on the topic by the fall of your third year.Dissertation Advisory CommitteeYour preliminary advisory committee members will usually become your dissertation advisory committee. If your preliminary advisory committee had no outside member, you must bring one on board at this time.The committee members should be Rochester faculty members holding the rank of at least assistant professor, and three should be from the Department of Computer Science. (For exceptions, see the section above on forming a preliminary advisory committee.)Each member must sign your thesis proposal defense form immediately after the thesis proposal defense. Your advisor should promptly return this form to the graduate program secretary.Producing a Thesis ProposalThis proposal should explain:The context of the problemThe problem itselfPrevious approachesYour proposed researchYou should also include a well-researched bibliography. The thesis proposal should be of high quality in style, content, and exposition.The thesis proposal and all other publications you have written during the year should be distributed to the dissertation advisory committee at least ten days before your thesis proposal defense. Students should ideally distribute materials before even scheduling the defense.The thesis proposal will usually describe your:Third-year researchThe specific research directions you will pursue in the immediate futureThe general research directions you will pursue in the more distant futureThe theme that will unify your research into a coherent PhD dissertationThe thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have acquired the skills needed to perform dissertation-quality research. You are expected to have performed new research of substantial strength and novelty since your area paper. Except in exceptional cases, this new research should be appropriate for inclusion in the dissertation.The thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have the technical strength needed to do PhD-quality research, and the vision to see the “big picture” into which that research fits.Furthermore, the thesis proposal should show that you not only know how to solve problems, but also how to frame the issues.Finally, the thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have developed strong and insightful intuitions as to which research themes are promising. The thesis proposal defense serves to verify these points.In short, the proposal, talk, and exam should demonstrate to the dissertation advisory committee that an entire dissertation is indeed likely to result within a reasonable time frame.A successful thesis proposal is not a guaranteed formula for producing a successful dissertation. As the research progresses, the research goals may change dynamically, and some initial goals may be too hard to be solved within the time frame.We therefore expect that the dissertation project will evolve to meet these contingencies, and that this evolution will be the primary topic of six-month reviews.Scheduling the Thesis Proposal DefenseOnce sufficient feedback on the thesis proposal has been gathered, you can schedule the Thesis Proposal Defense. This is best done early in the spring of the third year, though it can be done earlier, and must be done before the spring PAS.When you are ready to schedule the thesis proposal defense, see the graduate program secretary to reserve a room and date, and to complete a Thesis Proposal Defense Appointment Form.The graduate program secretary will not schedule more than two events in the same day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—to ensure the availability of interested faculty members. Students should try to schedule events well in advance to make sure they meet the spring PAS deadline.Defending the Thesis ProposalA public presentation is a required part of the thesis proposal defense. It is a chance for you to publicly present your ideas to the community and for your committee to judge both the ideas and the presentation.The presentation should take no more than an hour, and should concentrate on the proposed research and the current year’s research progress.You should provide the department secretary with the date, time, place, and abstract of the talk at least ten days in advance. She will then advertise the talk to the faculty, staff, and students.The actual exam, which will normally occur immediately following the public presentation, is a meeting of the dissertation advisory committee and the student. Other faculty may attend and freely question and comment.The purpose of the exam is for the committee—now that it has read the thesis proposal and heard the public talk—to ask you further questions and give you feedback.Questions may address any aspect of the proposal, including the actual research, the larger problem, your familiarity with previous work, and your expected attack on specific sub-problems. In addition to direct feedback, the committee will also report to the PAS.AccelerationYou may choose to attempt the third-year process in your second year. You will be expected to do so if you passed the area process during your first year.There are no delayed requirements in this case; accelerating simply amounts to completing the third-year hurdles one year early.

These breadth courses must be taken in the first or second year of graduate study.  At least one course in each group must be taken in the first year.  At most one starred (*) course per area can be used toward the breadth requirement, and at most two starred (*) courses, total, can be used toward the breadth requirement. Students have the flexibility to complete all of the breadth requirements during their first year, or to complete as few as one course per group in that year in order to allow more time for research.PhD students are expected to earn a B or better in all breadth courses.Area RequirementsIn addition to the breadth requirements, PhD students must complete an area's Area Requirements.  All research areas require writing an area paper and passing an oral area exam during the second year of graduate study. Each area also requires additional coursework, beyond the breadth requirement, that must be completed with a grade of B or better.A Master’s degree is offered to those PhD-program students passing the area paper with an appropriate level of performance or, in special cases, passing an alternative comprehensive examination given by two or more faculty members appointed by the Chair.Area specific requirements are as follows:Artificial Intelligence (AI) Area RequirementsAI Area Process—The student should form a committee of three or more AI faculty members before the area paper is due, and schedule a time and date for the exam so that all committee members can attend.The paper should include a survey of a research topic and initial original research.The defense begins with the student providing a 20-minute overview of the area paper, followed by an hour of intensive questioning by faculty members.Questions from faculty members will include:General questions about AIQuestions covering content learned in AI breadth courses taken by the studentQuestions about the area paperStudents are responsible for preparing themselves for these questions.AI Course Requirements—By the end of the fourth year, the student must complete at least two additional graduate-level AI/HCI courses with grades of B or better. These may include the non-starred entries of the AI/HCI breadth list, BCS 505 (Perception and Motor Systems), or other advanced courses with permission of the AI faculty.Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Area RequirementsHCI Area Process— The student should form a committee of three or more faculty members (at least two faculty from the CS department) before the area paper is due, and schedule a time and date for the exam so that all committee members can attend.The area paper may be a survey of a research topic, original research, or a combination of both.Following a public presentation of the paper, the student will answer questions from the committee about the paper and about any topic in HCI that is broadly relevant to the research topic.HCI Course Requirements—By the end of the fourth year, the student must complete three additional courses with grades of B or better, with one class drawn from each of the following three clusters.  i.

CSC416 - AR/VR Interaction DesignSystems Area RequirementsSystems Area Process— The committee will include most (if not all) of the systems faculty. For scheduling purposes, the systems faculty will provide the relevant student(s) with a few time slots (various days and times) in which they may schedule their exam(s). The area paper should be original MS-level research and a survey of related research topics. It is due two weeks before the area exam. At that same time, the systems faculty will provide the student with a small set of \"take home\" papers to be studied for the exam. At the area exam, following a presentation of the area paper, the student will answer questions from the faculty about the area paper, the take-home papers, and background knowledge from systems courses. Systems Course Requirements—By the end of the fourth year, the student must complete at least two additional graduate-level systems courses with grades of B or better.  These may include the non-starred entries of the systems breadth list or other advanced courses with permission of the systems faculty.Theory Area RequirementsTheory Area Process — The committee will include all of the theory faculty and the student will need to schedule a time and date for the exam so that all committee members can attend.The area process including the area defense is organized as follows:The student submits an area paper reflecting research ability. The area paper is due eight calendar days before the last day of classes of the spring term or one week before the oral exam, whichever comes first. Approximately two weeks before the oral exam, the student is given a set of “take home” papers.Approximately three hours before the oral exam, the student is given a written set of “morning questions.”The area defense consists of an oral exam covering the area paper, the take home papers, the morning questions, and other area-related questions.  The length of the exam is typically between 2 and 3 hours.Theory Course Requirements—By the end of the fourth year, the student must complete, each with a grade of B or better, CSC 484, CSC 486, and one additional non-starred course from the theory breadth list.A more detailed written description of the logistics of this process is available from the PhD program coordinator or any theory faculty member.PhD Thesis Proposal and Proposal DefenseSee PhD Thesis Proposal.PhD Dissertation and DefenseAs in programs everywhere, the culmination of the PhD program is a body of research that significantly advances the frontiers of human knowledge, the presentation of that research in a dissertation meeting the highest standards of academic scholarship, and an oral exam that successfully defends the dissertation before a committee of established scholars in the field.  For further information, consultyour thesis advisorthe University's Graduate Studies BulletinRegulations and University Policies Concerning Graduate StudiesThe University's Guide to the Final Defense<!--p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 48.0px; text-indent: -48.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 48.0px; text-indent: 48.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica}p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica}p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 96.0px; text-indent: 48.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica}span.s1 {font-kerning: none}span.s2 {font: 8.0px Helvetica; font-kerning: none}span.s3 {font: 4.0px Helvetica; font-kerning: none}-->Report a Digital Accessibility Barrier                  Department of Computer ScienceLocationUniversity of Rochester2513 Wegmans HallP.O.

We provide a collegial, interactive environment in which faculty directly mentor students. All faculty and PhD students, regardless of their area, are familiar with each other’s work. This is possible only in a relatively small, close-knit department.Our philosophy is that computer science research is a community endeavor, crucially dependent on the vitality of the local community in which it takes place. We believe that graduate students are the heart of our research productivity, and we make them first-class department citizens. Graduate students serve on all department committees and, in particular, are crucial members of faculty and graduate student recruitment efforts.

If you have questions or concerns that are not answered below, please email cs-labstaff@lists.rochester.edu.Computer Science AccountsWho receives accountsGetting started with your accountInitial loginProper account usageUsing LinuxResources for Getting Help (read section to view contact details)TA / Instructor / CSUG TutoringUniversity ITCIRCLabstaffFAQsComputer Science Lab SpacesComputer Science AccountsReceiving an AccountStudents are automatically provisioned accounts on the CS instructional network if they are registered for a CS course with programming as part of the syllabus and a course number greater than 172. These accounts remain active for the duration of the course and are automatically disabled at the completion of the semester. Students registered for CSC172 or below will not receive access to department accounts and can use campus IT computers to complete their course work. If you are currently formally enrolled in a course that qualifies you for an account, but have not received an account, please login to https://accounts.csug.rochester.edu and follow the instructions there.Students officially declaring their Computer Science (CS) major will also be provisioned an account on the CS instructional network. Accounts for declared majors will persist until the student graduates or leaves the program.Getting started with your accountInitial LoginInitial logins can be conducted either through SSH or with a desktop in the CS Majors Lab. When you login to https://accounts.csug.rochester.edu you will be provided with specific instructions for your initial login. Access to this website is limited to on-campus addresses and the university VPN. This site is not accessible from the wireless guest network. Please read the instructions carefully. If you have trouble logging in, please triple check that your are follow the instructions correctly, read through https://www.cs.rochester.edu/cms/csinfo/password-change/ (VPN or UR_Connected connection required), and check the FAQ's before contacting labstaff for help.Steps to change your password on your initial loginProper Account UsageIn the CS department your account is managed by an operating system called Linux. Workstations run Fedora Linux while many of the servers run a version of Linux named CentOS; both of which are sponsored by a software company called Red Hat.In Linux, users are provided with a home directory. A home directory is a space on the file system designed to provide each user with a private place to store their files, configurations, and personal settings. As the CS network has more users than your typical personal computer or network, your home directory and its files are typically not saved on the computer you are logged into, but instead loaded from a networked file share. Due to the network share, higher number of users, and differing computational loads there are marked differences between using a personal computer and a CS computer. Please keep the following in mind while using equipment on the CS network:Utilizing Department Hardware:On the instructional network there are 4 \"cycle\" servers that are used to connect to the instructional network.The machines are named cycle[1-4].csug.rochester.eduTo access these machines via ssh you must be on-campus (excluding guest Wi-Fi) or connected to the university VPN.If you are a CS major you can also utilize department hardware by logging into a desktop in the majors lab.cycle1 typically sees the highest amount of traffic.If the w command shows a high number of users or a high load average (typically over ~20) you may want to consider using one of the other cycle/gpu machines.When testing or repetitively launching code you have written please ensure that you are not irrecoverably tying up large amounts of resources by launching processes that get stuck in D and Z statuses (the commandstop/pscan be used to identify said processes)Workstation will periodically be restarted to apply updates, please ensure you are saving all work in case a restart for an urgent update is needed.When you are finished using a workstation please logout so that the resources can be reclaimed for the next user.Please do not power off workstations as they need to be running to keep updates current.User home directories are backed up nightly, contact cs-labstaff@lists.rochester.edu if needed.For the completion of coursework, the department has 6 gpu machines (gpu-node[01-06].csug.rochester.edu) that are reachable from the cycle machines.Disk Utilization:The instructional network has a disk quota (limit) set for your network mounted home directory depending on your student status. All user home directory space is backed up nightly but it is not vast like a personal hardrive. Home directory space is to be used for personal shell account configuration and assignments but it will not be large enough to store large datasets/files, or personal software installations. If you need software packages for assignments sometimes instructors and/or course teaching assistants make packages available elsewhere on the system for use by the class. You may also make use of quota free /localdisk (which is not backed up). /localdisk is hardrive space available directly on the local hardrive of the machine to install and test personal packages or temporarily store large files.  Non standard software and project storage requirements questions should be directed to your course instructor or TA.When you exceed your quota you will receive an email from the system.The quota command will show your allocated disk space.If you do not clean up your files you may be locked out of department resources, as programs that require file IO operations will not have space to write new data to disk.Quotas are small so keep an eye on your file sizes.Students commonly exceed their quotas by downloading large datasets, large python libraries, extra versions of python, large hidden files, and by letting their ./cache and ./config directories grow too large. To monitor these downfalls please see the “du” command below.Clearing your browser cache, removing core dump files, and emptying your trash folder regularly can help keep your disk usage down.Visual Studio Code is notoriously greedy for disk space (especially when using remote features). For this reason on the instructional network your vscode directory does not reside in your home directory. This location will be reset after each semester, so ensure you have backed up any configurations/workspaces you wish to keep.The remote dev features of other IDE's may be similarly inefficient, it is recomended to consult their documentation to either reduce their size or to move their default save location out of your home directory.When using virtual environments such as anaconda, individual apps like pip, huggingface…etc will still cache files to your default home location (~/.cache) If you are downloading datasets this may quickly fill up your home directory unless you read the apps documentation and change it’s default cache location.readlink -f <username> will show the location of your home directorydf -hwill show a disk utilization summaryWriting to files over a network (aka your home directory) is typically slower than writing to a drive installed in the computer.Space on the local computer’s hard drive is available at /localdisk, please note this space is not backed up.Conducting heavy computations with data/code saved in your home directory will most likely result in network IO slowing down your execution.Using LinuxOne of the most efficient ways to interface with Linux machines is through the Command Line Interface (CLI). What follows is a listing of some essential, tab complete, Linux CLI commands. More can be found at http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html.1. Navigating the File System:pwd: Print working directory (displays the current directory path).ls: List files and directories.Options: -l (long format), -a (show hidden files).cd: Change directory.Example: cd ~/Documents ( Changes to Documents folder in home dir.)Example: cd ( Changes to home dir.)2. File Operations:cp: Copy files or directories.Example: cp file.txt destination/mv: Move or rename files or directories.Example: mv file.txt newname.txt or mv file.txt destination/rm: Remove files or directories.Example: rm file.txtCaution: Use with care; it deletes files permanently.3. Working with Directories:mkdir: Create a new directory.Example: mkdir new_directoryrmdir: Remove an empty directory.rm -r: Remove a directory and its contents recursively.du -h –max-depth=1: Shows size of folder contents for current directory4. Viewing File Contents:cat: Display the entire contents of a file.more or less: View file contents one screen at a time.Example: less file.txt5. Editing Text Files:nano or vim: Text editors for creating or modifying files.Example: nano newfile.txt6. File Permissions:chmod: Change file permissions.Example: chmod +x script.sh (make a script executable).7. System Information:uname -a: Display information about the system.df -h: Show disk space usage.free -h: Display free and used memory.8. User Management:whoami: Display the current username.who: Show who is logged in.9. Searching for Files:find: Search for files and directories.Example: find / -name filename10. Network Commands:ping: Check network connectivity.Example: ping google.comifconfig or ip: Display network interface information.ssh: Secure Shell for remote login.11. Process Management:ps: Display information about running processes.kill: Terminate a process.Example: kill processIDtop: View interactive process list12. Compression and Archiving:tar: Create or extract tar archives.Example: tar -cvf archive.tar directory/13. Help and Manual:man: Access the manual pages for commands.Example: man lsResources for Getting HelpTo reach a party that is able to properly address your issue, please read through the following options and contact the appropriate recipient.

In an effort to increase diversity in computer science at Rochester we were an early member of the BRAID initiative (Building, Recruiting, And Inclusion for Diversity). Department sponsored trips for students to attend diversity conferences such as the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Technology, are a regular and encouraged occurrence.Our past two graduating classes have been ~34% female, nearly double the national average, and we will continue to build a community that encourages women and underrepresented minorities to pursue studies in computer science.Additional resources for diversity information at Rochester:Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)UR Women and Minorities in Computing (WiC-MiC)Report a Digital Accessibility Barrier                  Department of Computer ScienceLocationUniversity of Rochester2513 Wegmans HallP.O.

We strive to admit students who’ll work to make each other, the University, and the world ever better. Rochester’s quest for MelioraAs one of the world’s leading research universities, Rochester’s mission is to help our students and scholars learn, discover, heal, create, and make the world ever better. Embedded in that ideal are the values we share: equity, leadership, integrity, openness, respect, and accountability.What we look for in a YellowjacketAs a charter member of the Character Collaborative, we evaluate applicants within the unique context of their environment and their opportunities inside and outside of school. Highly trained admission professionals assess their academic achievement, extracurricular engagement, and ethical character, in order to admit a diverse group of students who will work to make each other, the University, and the world ever better in alignment with Rochester’s mission and values.Our holistic review process for undergraduate applicants includes, but intentionally goes beyond, numerical representations of academic performance, though we certainly expect strong performance in challenging academic coursework. We hope to understand much more about each applicant than simply their grades and standardized test scores. The students for whom Rochester is the best fit are driven by their intellectual curiosity and seek out opportunities for growth.Our admission criteria connect directly to our students’ undergraduate experiences and outcomes through the College Competencies, Rochester’s framework for students to tell their story and serve as leaders in our shared future. They were created to ensure Rochester students are prepared with the skills employers and society seek in 21st Century college graduates.Show us who you areWe value the individuality of our students and the ways they have already, or intend to customize their educational experiences to explore broadly AND dig deeply into specific academic areas. As students prepare to apply or interview for admission, we encourage them to consider the following:What are you interested in?What makes you interesting?What are your values?How have you improved yourself and your community?How will you make the world better? Supplemental Essay Prompts for 2023-24 Application CycleBoth parts must be completed as part of the application process. Part 1 – 250 word limitThe University of Rochester motto of Meliora – or “ever better” – deeply integrates critical core values into all that we do. These core values of equity, leadership, integrity, openness, respect and accountability define not only who we are, but also who we hope to become. Please use the space below to highlight a time, creative idea or research experience when you put into action one or more of these characteristics in order to make yourself, your community or the world ever better. Part 2 (choose 1) – 200 word limitAmerican social reformer, abolitionist, writer and statesman Frederick Douglass said, “Some know the value of education by having it. I knew its value by not having it.” Explain ways in which your background, educational experience, and opportunities have directly influenced you and your ability to do good in the world. What specific moments of growth, lessons learned, and resilience in your life have prepared you to promote positive change for your community and the world?Dr. Donna Strickland, University of Rochester alum and 2018 Nobel Prize winner in Physics said, “There’s no point in me being anything other than me.” The University of Rochester encourages each student to embrace the intersectionality of their identity and create their own individual curricular path and experience. What qualities and experiences make you the best version of yourself? What unique elements of your background, perspectives, and experiences will you bring to our community?Susan B. Anthony, champion of abolition and women’s rights, once said “Organize, agitate, educate must be our war cry.” As you look to join our community of doers and disruptors, in what ways do you envision using both the curricular flexibility and co-curricular opportunities to invoke change for marginalized groups? How has your unique lived experience shaped you and prepared you to be a changemaker here?The University of Rochester benefactor, entrepreneur, photography pioneer and philanthropist George Eastman said, “What we do during our working hours determines what we have; what we do in our leisure hours determines what we are.” How have the ways you’ve spent your time enabled you to grow as a person? What challenges have helped define you and your role within your community(s)?First-year applicantsApply online for early or regular decision using either the Common Application or Coalition for College Application.Transfer applicantsWe accept transfer students for both the fall and spring semesters, with applications reviewed on a rolling basis.International applicantsNot a US citizen or permanent resident?
