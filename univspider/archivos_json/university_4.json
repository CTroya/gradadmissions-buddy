Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

This monitoring and the associated status are not meant to punish or stigmatise. Instead, the goal is to successfully identify and resolve the challenges so that all students can complete their degrees successfully.As noted in the program requirements, the department allows a maximum of one D grade towards the CS MS. If a student earns additional D grades for a course, these cannot be counted towards the CS MS program. The course(s) must be repeated or substituted with a suitable, approved alternative.MASTERS STUDENT ACADEMIC STANDING STATUSFor MS students experiencing academic difficulty, we assign one of three statuses:Strict Probation – For cumulative GPA equal to or below 2.49Probation – For cumulative GPA between 2.50 and 2.69For both these statuses, the student will be required to meet with the Director for Student and Academic Services to discuss their strategies for recovery and to restore their GPA to good standing of at least 2.7 in a timely manner. Students who fail to do so are subject to dismissal from the program.Warning – For cumulative GPA between 2.7 and 2.99This status reflects the need for caution as the student’s GPA is in danger of dropping below the minimum 2.7 permitted for the MS Program. In this case, students are strongly encouraged to meet with the Director for Student and Academic Services or their CS Advisor. This status is removed once the student earns a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher.Updated 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Thesis TrackThe M.S. Thesis TrackThe MS Thesis track is for students who want to concentrate on research in some sub-field of Computer Science.  You are required to arrange for a Computer Science Faculty member who agrees to advise the thesis and the rest of your course selection prior to selecting the track.SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTSComplete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above)Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted).Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirementSatisfy breadth requirementsTake at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 levelAt most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review1. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Visit the breadth requirement page for more information.2. REQUIRED TRACK COURSES (9 credits)Students must take 9 credits of COMS E6902 Thesis. The points are typically spread over multiple semesters, e.g., 3 points each for 3 semesters or 4.5 points each for 2 semesters. No more than 9 points of E6902 may be taken. Sign up for the section number of E6902 associated with your thesis advisor.3. ELECTIVE TRACK COURSES Students are required to complete 9 elective credits of graduate courses (4000-level or above) selected from Computer Science and/or related areas together with your faculty thesis advisor. These would normally be strongly related to your thesis topic.Up to 3 of these points may be in COMS E6901 Projects in Computer Science.Please note:The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedDue to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirementsThe elective track courses cannot be imported from another institution.4. GENERAL ELECTIVESStudents must complete the remaining credits of General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher.Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.5. THESIS DEFENSEA thesis proposal is presented to your thesis committee at least three months before your defense. Your thesis committee should have three members. Two of them must be internal, but one can be an outsider. Please bring the thesis defense form to your defense. Once completed, please submit the form to CS Advising via email: ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu.The thesis cannot be imported from another institution.A publication-quality thesis document is also published as a CS department technical report. Once completed, please upload your thesis into MICE.PROGRAM PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated: 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Personalized TrackMS Personalized TrackThe MS Personalized track is for students who want to study the areas of Computer Science that are not covered by one of the other tracks. Prior to selecting the Personalized track, you must consult a CS faculty member who agrees to be your advisor and agrees to oversee your program.This should happen in your first semester so you can plan an appropriate and coherent course of study for the following two semesters. Retroactive approvals for the Personalized track in your second or third semester will not be considered. Also, please note that minor changes to existing tracks are not considered for the Personalized track.How to select a Personalized track:1) Obtain approval from a faculty member in the CS Department to be your advisor and consult with them to plan your course of study in your first semester.2) Finalize the plan by the beginning of your second semester.3) Email the Program Plan to ms-advising@cs.columbia.edu and request a change to your track in MICE. The deadline to change your track is the beginning of your second semester.SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTSComplete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above)Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted).Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirementSatisfy breadth requirementsTake at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 levelAt most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review1. Breadth Courses (12 credits)Visit the breadth requirement page for more information.2. Track Courses (18 credits)Students will build their course plan with their Track Advisor to ensure that their track courses meet the requirements of the MS 30-credit program. Students must take at least 6 credits of 6000-level graduate courses selected from Computer Science and/or related areas together with your faculty advisor. At most, 3 credits overall may be from “non-track” graduate courses.Please note: The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedDue to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements.The CS MS must contain at least 18 credits of coursework and may have a maximum of 12 credits of research credits.TRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated: 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses, at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher.Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review.Please note:Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesStudents must take at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 level overall. One of the Track Electives courses has to be a 3pt 6000-level course from the Track Electives listIf the number of points used to fulfill the above requirements is less than 30, then General Elective graduate courses at 4000 level or above must be taken so that the total number of credits taken is 30The Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

General ElectivesStudents must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review. Please note:Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements.4 elective courses (12 points) selected from the list of Elective Track Courses; at least 2 of these courses must be 6000-level CS coursesStudents who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with appropriate General Elective graduate courses; 3 credits at the 6000 level and 3 credits at the 4000 level or above. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to their Track Advisor for review.Please note:Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirementsStudents who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, e.g., for DNA sequencing and for measuring RNA expression via DNA microarrays, are changing the nature of biomedical research.They empower fundamental new understandings of biological mechanisms with far-reaching applications to biological and medical sciences. To fulfill this promise, new computational techniques are needed to analyze genome sequences, protein structures, metabolic and regulatory pathways, evolutionary patterns, and the genetic basis of disease. The computational biology track seeks to provide state of the art understanding of this concomitant growth of high-throughput experimental techniques, computational techniques to analyze their data, the resulting new understandings of biological mechanisms, and their applications to pharmacological and medical practice (from diagnosis to drug design).SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTSComplete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above)Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted).Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirementSatisfy breadth requirementsTake at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 levelAt most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review1. Breadth CoursesVisit the breadth requirement page for more information.2. Required Track CoursesStudents are required to complete two required courses (6 points): One course from either COMS W4761 (Computational Genomics) or COMS W4762 Machine Learning for Functional Genomics and one course from either COMS W4771 or SIEO W4150/IEOR W4150/*STAT 4001. Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead.Any course option taken but not used towards the Required Course can be counted as an elective.Students must take one of the following courses: Course IDTitleCOMS W4761Computational GenomicsCOMS W4762Machine Learning for Functional GenomicsStudents must take one of the following courses: Course IDTitleCOMS W4771 or STAT 4400Machine Learning or Statistical Machine LearningSTAT 4001/IEOR W4150*Probability and Statistic* STAT 4001 has replaced SIEO W4150. SIEO W4150 taken before Spring 2024 may be used to fulfill this requirement. 3. Track Electives Students are required to take two courses from the following list, at least one of which must be a 6000-level course. Other courses on this list may be used as general electives or waiver replacements when the student has received a waiver. Course IDTitleCOMS W4111Introduction to DatabasesCOMS W4252Introduction to ComputationalLearning TheoryCOMS W4772 (E6772)Advanced Machine LearningCOMS W4995Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 4995 courses apply to this track.COMS E6111Advanced Database SystemsCOMS E6901Projects in Computer Science (Advisor approval required)COMS E6998Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 6998 courses apply to this track.CMBS 5305Topics in Mathematical Genomics and BiologyBIOC W4512Molecular BiologyBIOL W4031Genetics IBIOL W4032Genetics IIBIOL W5031Genetics (This replaces BIOL 4031 and BIOL 4032.

General ElectivesStudents must complete the remaining credits of General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher.Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review.Please note:At least 3 elective points must be selected from courses in biological departmentsStudents who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesDue to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirementsThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated: 3/13/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

About                    The group does research on the fundamental capabilities and limitations of efficient computation.In addition, they use computation as a lens to gain deeper insights into problems from the natural, social, and engineering sciences.The group is highly collaborative, both within Columbia and among peer institutions. They hold a weekly Theory Lunch and a bi-weekly Student Seminar. Most graduate students have (at least) two advisors and collaborate with several professors and other students. Some of the faculty are cross-listed with the IEOR department and the Data Science Institute.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

NLP technologies are of central importance in automating the analysis of text and speech databases and in enabling man-machine interactions through natural language. This track will help you develop leading-edge knowledge of these technologies.SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTSComplete a total of 30 points (Courses must be at the 4000 level or above)Maintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted).Complete the Columbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL) requirementSatisfy breadth requirementsTake at least 6 points of technical courses at the 6000 levelAt most, up to 3 points of your degree can be Non-CS/Non-track If they are deemed relevant to your track and sufficiently technical in nature. Submit the Non-CS/NonTrack form and the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review1. Breadth Courses Visit the breadth requirement page for more information.2. Required Track Courses Students are required to complete the following 3 courses. Students who have taken equivalent courses in the past and received grades of at least a B may apply for waivers and take other CS courses instead.Course IDTitleCOMS W4705Natural Language ProcessingCOMS 4706/ E6998Spoken Language Processing (COMS 4706), or Advanced Spoken Language Processing (COMS 6998) or Fundamentals of Speech Recognition; (Spring 2017 approved substitute: COMS E6998.004 Computational Models of Speech and Language)COMS E6998One additional topics course that focuses on NLP3. Elective Track Courses Students are required to complete 2 courses out of the following list; at least 1 course must be a 6000-level CS course. Since other departments vary their offerings considerably from year to year, it is possible to count such courses toward the MS degree; please propose courses you think might be suitable to your track advisor.Course IDTitleCOMS W4170User Interface DesignCOMS W41723D User InterfacesCOMS W4252Introduction to Computational Learning TheoryCOMS W4701Artificial IntelligenceCOMS W4771 or W4721*Machine Learning or Machine Learning for Data ScienceCOMS W4772Advanced Machine LearningCOMS 4995Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 4995 courses apply as electives for this track.COMS E6901Projects in Computer Science (Advisor approval required)COMS E6998 Visit the topics courses page to see which COMS 6998 courses apply as electives for this track.SIEO W4150**Probability and StatisticsECBM E6040Neural Networks and Deep LearningEECS E6894Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Natural Language ProcessingELEN E4810Digital Signal ProcessingELEN E6829Speech/Audio Processing-RecognitionPSYC G4232Production and Perception of LanguagePSYC G4275Contemporary Topics in Language and CommunicationPSYC G4205Models of CognitionPSYC 4236Machine IntelligencePSYC G4470Psychology and Neuropsychology of LanguagePSYC G6006Introduction to Statistical Modeling in Psychology* Due to significant overlap, students can receive credits for only one of these courses (either COMS W4771 Machine Learning or COMS W4721 Machine Learning for Data Science).** STAT 4001 taken Spring 2018 or prior may count as a substitute for Probability and Statistics/Advanced Data Analysis4. General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. At least three of these points must be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review.*Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements.**Known non-track CS course**CSOR E4995 Topics in Computer Science and IEOR – Financial Software SystemsPlease note:Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated 10/17/2023                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

They also mentor a very large number of master’s and undergraduate research project students who participate in their research each semester. They have regular talks for faculty, students, and the larger New York area community.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

To fulfill this requirement, take 1 course from Group 1 (Systems), 1 course from Group 2 (Theory), 1 course from Group 3 (AI and Applications), and 1 more course from any of the three approved lists for a total of 4 courses.Only the courses listed in the table below may be used for Breadth. Exceptions to the table below will not be made. 6000-level courses cannot be used for Breadth. The only joint-CS courses permitted are as specified below; all other breadth courses must be strictly “COMS.”  Regardless of the course number, courses labeled “certificate only” or named “xxx for Data Science” or similar may not be applied to the MS breadth requirement.Breadth courses may overlap with a required track or track/general elective course. Refer to your track page for more details. For a course overlap to be possible, the course must be listed on your track page and in the chart below. Please be advised that all students will still need 30 credits to complete the CSMS degree. All breadth courses must be taken at Columbia and cannot be waived or substituted.GroupApproved Courses1.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elective Courses at the 4000 level or above. Three credits must be from a graduate CS course and can be chosen from either the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department at the 4000 level or higher. Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review.**Due to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, COMS 4721, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirements.Please note:For the Security track, you must have six points at the 6000 level; at least three of these 6000-level points must be selected from the list of Elective Track Courses.Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated: 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

General Electives Students must complete the remaining credits with General Elecevtives at the 4000 level or higher. These courses can be selected from the Track Electives listed above or from the CS department (4000 level or higher.)Students may also request to use at most 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track coursework if approved by the process listed below.Non-CS/Non-Track: CS MS students may request up to 3 points of Non-CS/Non-Track points to count toward their 30-point MS program. CS Track advisor may review and approve if the course is determined to be relevant to the CS MS track and sufficiently technical in nature. Students should send the Non-CS/Non-Track Form and the course syllabus to your Track Advisor for review.IEOR E4550y: Entrepreneurial Business Creation for Engineers is a known non-track coursePlease note:Students who waive track requirements by using previous courses must still complete 30 graduate credits. This can be done by expanding their elective selection to include courses listed as required track courses and elective track courses; or by taking other graduate coursesDue to a significant overlap in course material, MS students not in the Machine Learning track can only take 1 of the following courses – COMS 4771, ELEN 4903, IEOR 4525, STAT 4240, STAT 4400/4241/5241 – as part of their degree requirementsThe Degree Progress Checklist should be used to keep track of your requirements. If you have questions for your Track Advisor or CS Advising, you should have an updated Checklist preparedTRACK PLANNINGPlease visit the Directory of Classes to get the updated course listings. Please also note that not all courses are offered every semester or even every year. A few courses are offered only once every two or three years or even less frequently.Updated 3/26/2024                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

About                    The Computational Biology Group brings together interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary individuals and skillsets to tackle problems in high throughput genomics, systems biology, and genetics.The group develops computational methods to analyze high throughput data on genetic variants within species, primarily human SNP, and sequencing data.The student and postdoc body in the group is very diverse in terms of undergraduate background as well as current PhD program or postdoctoral affiliation. The group meets weekly giving an opportunity for students to present their research internally and feedback on one another’s work. Weekly meetings occasionally give host to guest speakers, include a journal club, or extracurricular activities.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Students will have a number of resources available to them as they prepare for employment.The Graduate Career Placement (GCP) Team works to connect graduate students at Columbia Engineering with a variety of employers and employment opportunities. Additionally, graduate students of the Department of Computer Science will partner with the department’s Career Placement Officers (CPOs) throughout their program to ensure they are prepared for the next steps in their professional careers. The CPOs will be the student’s first point of contact for their career development needs.The Center for Career Education (CCE) offers a wide range of resources for undergraduate job seekers. The CCE manages LionShare, the job and internship database available for undergraduate students at Columbia Engineering. Students can check LionShare regularly for updated job listings as new opportunities are posted daily.The Department of Computer Science works in conjunction with the GCP Team and the CCE to host numerous career-related events each semester, including employer info sessions, tech talks, alumni panels, and much more. We encourage students to participate in as many of these events as possible — the more students learn about the job search process, the savvier they will be when it comes time to apply!For a comprehensive list of upcoming events, graduate students can visit Career Connect, while undergraduate students can visit the CCE event calendar. Employers Seeking to HireThere are a number of ways for employers to recruit and connect with Columbia engineers!

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

CS MS applicants need to follow the Master of Science Deadlines.MS PROGRAMSThe Master of Science (MS) program is intended for those who wish to broaden and deepen their understanding of computer science. Columbia University and the New York City environment provide excellent career opportunities in multiple industries. The program provides a unique opportunity to develop leading-edge in-depth knowledge of specific computer science disciplines.MS applicants whose primary interests include software engineering, theory, AI, machine learning, vision/graphics, natural language processing, or other core CS areas should apply to the Computer Science MS Program.MS applicants whose primary interests include computer architecture, parallel systems, embedded systems, or digital/VLSI design should apply to the Computer Engineering MS Program. MS Application Priority Deadlines Applications will be accepted after priority deadlines; however, we encourage you to submit your application as early as possible after we open the application. Fall: January 15th (Priority), February 15th (Regular)Spring: October 15  Track Options Computational Biology Natural Language ProcessingComputer SecuritySoftware SystemsFoundations of Computer ScienceVision and GraphicsMachine LearningPersonalizedNetwork SystemsMS Thesis  Still have questions? View our CS MS Application FAQs  DUAL MS IN JOURNALISM AND COMPUTER SCIENCEAdmitted students will enroll for a total of five semesters — approximately three in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and two in the Journalism School. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a seminar and workshop designed specifically for the dual degree program. The seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support news gathering. In the workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind.  Want to learn more? Visit the program website!  PHD PROGRAMA small number of highly qualified students are admitted each year to the PhD Program in Computer Science. Admission is very competitive, based primarily on research-oriented reference letters, academic grades, and overall experience and record. Applicants need not already hold a master’s degree; bachelor’s degree-level applicants are also encouraged to apply.Most admitted students receive full financial support through Graduate Research Assistantships, which consist of a monthly stipend plus full tuition exemption (continuation of support is, of course, contingent upon the student’s satisfactory progress in the PhD Program and availability of funding). In addition, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science awards a small number of prestigious “Presidential Distinguished Fellowships.” These fellowships provide full financial support to their recipients. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek external funding, such as government and industry fellowships. Also, Columbia rents low-cost subsidized apartments near campus for both single students and students with families.All PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activity full-time on-campus throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere. Therefore, the department does not normally consider admission of part-time students.Also, note that it is not possible to participate in the PhD Program through the Columbia Video Network. HOW AND WHEN TO APPLY TO THE PHD PROGRAM All applications to our PhD Program must be made electronically. The online application system is available on the SEAS Admissions website. The deadlines for the submission of your fully completed application are:Starting the PhD Program in the Spring semester: apply by November 15 of the previous yearStarting the PhD Program in the Fall semester: apply by December 15 of the previous yearYou can still apply after these deadlines. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly or have the best chance of getting funding from our department. HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION The SEAS Admissions website contains detailed information about all aspects of the application process.You are also encouraged to investigate the research conducted in the Department of Computer Science prior to application. In particular, think about which faculty members share your research interests and also look at the research group homepages. Feel free to contact potential faculty advisors by email to request information about their recent research and publications and to ask about opportunities in their research groups or labs.Finally, become familiar with our PhD degree requirements.If you are interested in learning more about a day in the life of our PhD students, check out the Demystifying the Dissertation: PhD Research Discussions seminar series, which highlights several Computer Science PhD students. In their videos, these students discuss their experiences and research projects. COMPUTER SCIENCE PhD PRE-SUBMISSION APPLICATION REVIEW (PAR) PROGRAM The PhD PAR program offers a one-time review of an applicant’s Personal Statement and CV. The review is done by a current computer science PhD student. For more information, please visit PhD Pre-Submission Application Review Program.QUESTIONS?We receive an enormous volume of emails with application-related questions, so read the FAQ page carefully before sending us an email. Questions about particular research groups or individual faculty members should be directed to the appropriate faculty members by email. Transcripts, GRE/TOEFL/ IELTS, fee waivers  Office of Graduate Student Affairs Undergraduate Admissions  Office of Undergraduate Admissions CS MS Admissions  MS Admissions CS PhD Admissions  PhD Admissions CVN MS Program  CVN Updated 11/06/2023                                                                Find open faculty positions here.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Is there a specific emphasis on expertise and research within the Computer Science Department at Columbia? Which areas of CS are particularly strong at Columbia?                                                         The Department of Computer Science at Columbia has distinguished research strengths in a number of areas, including vision and computer graphics, computer and network security, networks, machine learning, computer architecture, and natural language processing. Examples of specific research groups are:Graphics and User InterfacesSecurity; Intrusion DetectionLanguages & CompilersMachine LearningSpeech and Natural Language ProcessingNetwork ComputingSoftware SystemsVision and RoboticsA complete list of research groups can be found here.                                                                                                             Why should I pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Columbia?                                                         Columbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.Most Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.                                                                                                             What makes your Computer Science program stand out compared to other top programs and institutions?                                                         Many of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.Finally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.                                                                                                             What opportunities are there to get involved in Computer Science research at Columbia?                                                         The Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.                                                                                                             What research, internship, and fellowships opportunities exist during the summer months, and how do I participate?                                                         There are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.                                                                                                             What kinds of career opportunities would this major/concentration prepare me for?                                                         In addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law.

What percentage of your Computer Science undergraduates go on to graduate school?                                                         According to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.                                                                                                             How does the Computer Science program differ between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Columbia College, Barnard, and General Studies?                                                         The Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.The courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.                                                                                                             Is it possible to do a double major with an entirely different subject (e.g., English)?                                                         It may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.                                                                                                             What are the differences between the Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees?                                                         While there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.                                                                                                             Does the CS department process undergraduate admissions?                                                         No, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications.

Being Forwarded to the MS Application Pool from the PhD Application Pool:                                                                                I applied to the PhD program, but I have received a notice that I have been admitted to the MS program. What does this mean?                                                         Your application to the PhD program was unsuccessful, but since you indicated that you would like to be considered for the MS program, your application was forwarded to the MS application pool for consideration.                                                                                                             I applied for the PhD program, was unsuccessful, and have been offered a place on the MS program. If I join the MS program, can I reapply for the PhD program later?                                                         Yes, after entering the MS program, you can apply for the PhD program the following year, and transfer into the PhD program if you are successful.                             Decision:                                                                                When will I receive a decision on my application?                                                         The Committee reviewers evaluate all applications and make admission decisions. As soon as that decision is made, you will be notified by email to the address specified on your online application.We cannot respond to requests for updates on decisions.                                                                                                             I submitted my application a while ago and still have not heard about a decision yet. Has a decision been made?                                                         If you have not received the email notification yet, that means the application is still being evaluated. As soon as a decision is made, you will be notified automatically via email. Due to the high volume of applications, we cannot respond to requests for updates on decisions.                                                                                                             If I am denied admission, may I receive feedback on the reasons behind the decision?                                                         Unfortunately, due to the high volume of applications received, the Department cannot provide specific feedback on the decisions made.                             Funding Information:                                                                                Are there funding opportunities?                                                         US students are encouraged to apply for scholarships, merit fellowships, and loans. Visit the FFSEAS Official Financial Aid and Educational Financing for more information.

Reactivation:                                                                                I have been offered admission to the MS program, but my situation has changed and I want to enroll in a later semester. What should I do?                                                          You will have to reactivate your application and pass the review process again. Your online application and official documents are held for a maximum of 12 months from your original submission date and can be reactivated once within this time without repaying the application fee.SEAS does not permit “deferring” – the application will be reviewed again with the new applicant pool and admission is not guaranteed.                                                                                                             I want to apply for admission for the Fall or Spring semester in one year's time or more, but I cannot see my semester of choice in the online system. What can I do?                                                         Applications are only accepted up to a maximum of two semesters in advance. Check back at a later date when your semester of choice will be activated to receive applications.                                                                                                             I was denied admission. Can I reactivate my application?                                                         No, you cannot reactivate your rejected application. You can reapply to the program by creating a new online application with all materials resubmitted. Please be aware that you will need to pay the application fee again when you create a new application.                                                                                                             I am reactivating my application. Do I need to submit my test scores?                                                         If you have previously applied to the CS graduate program and submitted official scores the first time through ETS and those scores are still valid, then you do not need to resubmit them with your current application. If your test scores have expired as of the new application deadline, you need to retake the exam and submit those new scores.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

The program offers the highest caliber of Computer Science and Journalism training available at Columbia University. Students will earn MS degrees in both Computer Science and Journalism.PROGRAM OVERVIEWExplore the frontiers of journalism with cutting-edge tools and techniques! The dual degree program in Journalism and Computer Science prepares students for robust opportunities in both fields, including designing and building platforms, algorithms, and applications for journalism or pursuing research and development work in computer science related to journalism, natural language processing, and the digital humanities.Our goal is to train a new generation of journalistically literate Computer Scientists (or computationally literate journalists) who will redefine journalism as we know it.Students enroll for a total of four semesters at the Journalism and Engineering schools, learning the fundamentals of reporting and writing while developing technical skills in Computer Science and Software Design. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a Seminar and Workshop designed specifically for the Dual Degree program. The Seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support newsgathering.In the Workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind. Students will also engage in projects supervised jointly by professors in Computer Science and Journalism to obtain hands-on experiential learning.WHO SHOULD APPLY?The Dual MS in Journalism and Computer Science program seeks applicants with outstanding undergraduate records, including a strong background in computer science and extensive mathematics or engineering training. Equally important: applicants should have excellent writing skills and be familiar with the fundamentals of reporting. Graduates will be poised to become leaders in digital media production and innovation.Applicants must be accepted into both the Journalism School and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.Additional information for Journalism Admission requirements can be found here, while additional information for the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science can be found here.STILL HAVE ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS? EMAIL US!CS Admissions QuestionJournalism Admissions QuestionADVISINGTo help students manage their registration and course requirements, the Computer Science and Journalism Faculty Advisors will meet with dual degree students twice per year—in early April and late October—to plan the next semester’s schedules.One week after each of these meetings, Track Graduation Documents should be completed and submitted to CS Advising.If you have questions about picking CS courses to take or the CS requirements that you cannot find answers to below, please email the CS Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Hsu.If you have questions about the CS registration process or general CS questions, please contact CS Advising.If you have questions about the Journalism part of the program, please visit the Journalism website to see journalism requirements or email the Journalism Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Bell.CS Faculty AdvisorCS AdvisingJournalism Faculty AdvisorCS REQUIREMENTSTo fulfill the CS Requirements, dual-degree students must:Earn a total of 27 Computer Science pointsMaintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA in CS courseworkComputer Science courses are organized into three categories: core, required, and electives. Core classes are meant to ensure a strong computer science foundation for all graduates, required courses allow students to branch out and learn advanced topics in-depth, and electives are often seminar or project-based courses that allow more freedom within a topic. See below for details about each category.                                                                                Core Requirement                                                         Students must take four courses from the following six to satisfy the Core Requirement:Course IDCourse TitleCOMS W4111Introduction to DatabasesCOMS W4115Programming Language and TranslatorsCOMS W4156Advanced Software EngineeringCOMS W4170User Interface DesignCSOR W4231Analysis of AlgorithmsCOMS W4701Artificial IntelligenceWAIVING CORE REQUIREMENTSCore Computer Science courses may be waived or tested out of if you have taken an equivalent course in the past and can demonstrate a strong grasp of the content.In order to waive courses, you must receive approval from the instructor teaching the Columbia equivalent course. This can be done in two ways: first, by importing the course on Mice. To import a course and apply for a waiver, you must attach the syllabus from the course you previously took and your transcript to demonstrate you earned a B or higher. You then must match your course to a Columbia equivalent course. Mice will then automatically send your import request to the applicable instructor for their review.The second way to obtain a course waiver is by reaching out to the instructor of the Columbia equivalent course directly through email and attaching the applicable syllabi and transcript(s) from your previous course(s). If the instructor approves, then you must forward that email to CS Advising so we can make note of any approvals.You may also test out of certain Core Requirements by taking the final exam and earning above a B+.For questions regarding course waivers and how to test out of select courses, please contact CS Advising.If you have taken a CS course at Columbia that has not counted towards a prior degree at Columbia, then please contact CS Advising to learn more about how to transfer the points toward the Dual Degree by applying for Advanced Standing.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Student projects will be closely guided by the instructors and domain experts The final deliverables will be shared with the domain expert to determine potential application of the concepts beyond the course. This could include advancing ideas through the formation of a startup, incorporating ideas into the domain expert’s work, or establishing partnerships with organizations working on similar challenges.Course website: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/classes/ddsi/index.htmlCOMS 4995 DEEP LRNG FOR COMP VISION | Belhumeur, PeterRecent advances in Deep Learning have propelled Computer Vision forward. Applications such as image recognition and search, unconstrained face recognition, and image and video captioning which only recently seemed decades off, are now being realized and deployed at scale. This course will look at the advances in computer vision and machine learning that have made this possible. In particular we will look at Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs), Long Short Term Memories (LSTMs) and their application to computer vision. We will also look at the datasets needed to feed these data-hungry approaches–both how to create them and how to leverage them to address a wider range of applications. The course will have homework assignments and a final project; there will be no exams. COMS 4995 Design using C++ | Bjarne Stroustrup.Prerequisites: Graduate standing or senior undergraduate and an interest in the use of programming languages and tools.Note: There will be no recording or remote access.Abstract: This course will use the C++ language and some C++ libraries as examples of software design and design decisions. It is not a C++ programming course though it will use the principles and design decisions that underly the major C++ features as prime examples and see how they are expressed in actual features and libraries. The evolution of those ideals and the support offered is also examined. Some experience with C++ and other languages is assumed. The book “A Tour of C++ (3rd edition)” will be read over the first half of the course to give the students a common foundation in C++.“Design” is not primarily a book skill; it involves a variety of principles and techniques that must be practiced for mastery. Consequently, the second half of the course is devoted to 3-person projects involving design, implementation, documentation, and presentation of projects of the students’ choice (after approval from the professor). Students are expected to attend other students’ presentations and see how they are expressed in actual features and libraries. The evolution of those ideals and the support offered is also examined.

The course will focus on the utility of these elements in common tasks of a data scientist, rather than their theoretical formulation and properties. The course provides a foundation of basic theory and methodology with applied examples to analyze large engineering, business, and social data for data science problems. Hands-on experiments with R or Python will be emphasized. COMS 4995 ENGR SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE | Yang, JunfengIn 2011, Marc Andreessen penned a famous Wall Street Journal article “Why Software Is Eating The World.” Almost a decade later, software is still eating the world. Companies like Google, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb are revolutionizing entire industry sectors, and even traditional enterprises have to embrace this transition to software and automate numerous tasks within their organizations in order to remain competitive. This software revolution is driven primarily by two technology trends. On the client side, billions of users now own computers and smartphones with broadband Internet access, providing each of them “instant access to the full power of the Internet, every moment of every day.” On the backend, cloud services and readily available software tools vastly simplify creating software startups in many industries, without the need to invest in infrastructure or employee training. For instance, when WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for approximately $19.3 billion dollars, it powered hundreds of millions of users worldwide but had merely 50 employees. These technology trends not only enable software to flourish, but also fundamentally change our software engineering process. Broadband access enables developers to run their software in the cloud for users to access via browsers or mobile apps — so-called Software-as-a-Services (SaaS). The developers of SaaS products continuously gather user feedback and behavior analytics, quickly refine existing or build new product features, and deploy to production in matter of minutes to test out their ideas — so called Agile Development. This style of close collaboration with customers and fast iteration of product ideas is in stark contrast with how software was engineered two decades ago. In this course, we will study modern software engineering practices including including topics such as SaaS architecture, behavior-driven development, Ruby on Rails, and Dev/ops. For details on the topics we will cover, please check out the Course Syllabus page. COMS W4995 Geometric Data Analysis | Andrew BlumbergThe goal of this class is to introduce approaches to analyzing datapresented as finite metric spaces using ideas from algebraic topology and differential geometry. Prerequisites are a grounding in basic probability, statistics, and linear algebra. The class will focus on rigorous mathematical foundations and applications drawn from computational genomics.COMS 4995 HACKING 4 DEFENSE | Blaer, Paul  Couse WebsiteSolve complex technology problems critical to our National Security with a team of engineers, scientists, MBAs, and policy experts. In a crisis, national security initiatives move at the speed of a startup yet in peacetime they default to decades-long acquisition and procurement cycles. Startups operate with continual speed and urgency 24/7. Over the last few years they’ve learned how to be not only fast, but extremely efficient with resources and time using lean startup methodologies. In this class student teams develop technology solutions to help solve important national security problems. Student teams take actual national security problems and learn how to apply the Lean launchpad and Lean Startup principles, (“business model canvas,” “customer development,” and “agile engineering”) to discover and validate customer needs and to continually build iterative prototypes to test whether they understood the problem and solution. Teams take a hands-on approach requiring close engagement with actual military, Department of Defense and other government agency end-users. Team applications required. Limited enrollment. Taught by Professor Paul Blaer and Jason Cahill, Hacking for Defense™ is a university-sponsored class that allows students to develop a deep understanding of the problems and needs of government sponsors in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. In a short time, students rapidly iterate prototypes and produce solutions to sponsors’ needs. This course provides students with an experiential opportunity to become more effective in their chosen field, with a body of work to back it up. For government agencies, it allows problem sponsors to increase the speed at which their organization solves specific, mission-critical problems.

Machine learning algorithms allow computers to learn from example data, and produce a program that does the job. Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithm originally inspired by the brain, but which have recently have seen a lot of success at practical applications. They are at the heart of production systems at companies like Google and Facebook for image processing, speech-to-text, and language understanding. This course gives an overview of both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in neural net algorithms.Roughly the first 2/3 of the course focuses on supervised learning — training the network to produce a specified behavior when one has lots of labeled examples of that behavior. The last 1/3 focuses on unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. COMS 4995 OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT | Paine, TimothyCourse Description:In this course, students will learn how to build and maintain open source projects.Students will be responsible for both supporting an existing open source project of their choosing, as well as creating their own open source project (both in either Python or Javascript, under the direction of the instructor).In lieu of homeworks or exams, ongoing progress reports and a final presentation on these two will serve as the grading basis for the course.The course will include an overview of general software engineering concepts, including version control, testing, modern development workflows, and software licensing, as well as a brief history of open source software including major court cases in copyright, patent, and trademark law.We will also learn about popular tools for– project management (Github, Kanban/Agile boards)– testing (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)– static analysis and coverage (Codecov, Coveralls)– documentation (GitHub Pages, Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus, ReadTheDocs)– publishing (npm, PyPI, anaconda)Beyond the basics, students will learn how these tools can be integrated together in their open source projects to better manage their development and community.  COMS 4995 PARALLEL FUNCTIONAL PROGR | Edwards, StephenPrerequisites: COMS 3157 Advanced Programming or the equivalent. Knowledge of at least one programming language and related development tools/environments required. Functional programming experience not required. Functional programming in Haskell, with an emphasis on parallel programs. The goal of this class is to introduce you to the functional programming paradigm. You will learn to code in Haskell; this experience will also prepare you to code in other functional languages. The first half of the class will cover basic (single-threaded) functional programming; the second half will cover how to code parallel programs in a functional setting.COMS W4995 Semantic Representations for NLP | Daniel BauerMost NLP tasks and applications require some level of understanding of the semantics (meaning) of linguistic expressions. The question of how to represent semantics and how to map between surface linguistic expressions to semantic representations is therefore an important part of NLP research. This course will explore some of the challenges surrounding semantic representations in various applications. We will compare a variety of approaches to representing the meaning of words and sentences from an NLP perspective, including symbolic/logic-based representations and resources, as well as modern distributional and multi-modal approaches. Requirements include homework assignments, a paper presentation, and a final project. COMS 4995 TECH INTERVIEW PREP C++ | Yongwhan LimUpon successful completion of the course, you will have mastered the fundamental knowledge required to succeed in any entry-level technical interview at the top-tier IT companies (FAANG or equivalent). In case you are looking for a job in the IT industry upon graduation, you will get exposed to what software engineers do on a day-to-day basis. We will also touch on some system design and behavioral interview questions but, as those are typically not part of the entry-level technical interview loop, those would not be the main focus of the course COMS 4995 UBIQUITOUS SEQUENCING | Pe’er, ItshackDNA sequences are life’s information system. The recent technological revolution allowing ubiquitous collection of such sequence data opened up applications from viral identification to molecular barcoding to forensics to efficient long-term data storage and more. The class will present background to the available technologies along with an introduction to what can be gleaned from the data they produce. The class will include a significant hands-on component in hackathon format. The class is open to an interdisciplinary community of undergraduates and graduate students who will mutually benefit one another with their disciplinary skills. Specifically, students with zero background in biology are welcome. Computing background is needed at a very basic level (Intro CS, or Computing in Context, or AP CS or instructor’s approval). A detailed description of a previous run of the class is available in https://elifesciences.org/articles/14258                                                                                                              COMS 6998 TOPICS COURSES                                                         COMS 6998 TOPICS COURSESCOMS 6998 ADV SPOKEN LANGUAGE PROCESSING | Hirschberg, JuliaCourse Description:  This class will introduce students to spoken language processing:  basic concepts, analysis approaches, and applications.  Applications include Text-to-Speech Synthesis, dialogue systems, and analysis of entrainment, personality, emotion, humor and sarcasm, deception and charisma.6998 ADV TOPICS PROJ DEEP LEAR | Belhumeur, PeterThis is a seminar course in which the students read, present, and discuss research papers on deep learning. The focus will be mostly on applications in computer vision, but topics in natural language processing, language translation, and speech recognition will also be read and discussed. It is expected that students taking the course will have prior experience with deep learning and neural network architectures. There will be no assignments other than reading and presentations. However, there will be a final project that students will work on throughout the duration of the semester. Enrollment is capped at 25 students. Instructor permission is required to register.COMS 6998 ADV WEB DESIGN STUDIO | Chilton, LydiaThis semester, Advanced Web Design Studio is partnering with faculty and students in Journalism and Architecture to design, build and deploy “public interest technology.” We will introduce interdisciplinary design methods and principles for Human Computer Interaction — mixing Architecture, Urban Planning, Computer Science, and Journalism — that respond to the potentials as well as the adverse effects of computation on society today. Our work will be dedicated to leveraging technology to support public interest organizations. We will move beyond short-term metrics—clicks, daily active users, and private profit—to focus on fostering long-term value and local networks. Students will work together to create and deploy interdisciplinary projects in collaborative teams, with the aim of serving the public and using technology to advance justice, equality, and inclusion in society. We will also be alert to the ways in which the language of “public interest” can sometimes hide or offer alibis for other political or private interests. For the first half of the semester, coding and design exercises, and complete short readings on journalism, urban planning, and public interest technology. During the second half of the semester students will iterate their work and put their projects into action. A strict pre-requisite is to have taken COMS 4170 UI Design, or have taken an equivalent class with both web-based implementation and design components. You must also fill out the prerequisite form that will be available thru SSOL. It is also here: https://forms.gle/v3a22idw9qgubgcG9. The faculty instructors in each area are: Lydia Chilton: School of Engineering, Computer Science; Mark Hansen: School of Journalism; Laura Kurgan: Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and PreservationHere are some examples of Public Interest Technology:— Ushahidi: Since 2008, thousands have used this crowdsourcing platform in disaster settings, from violence post-election to earthquakes and floods worldwide.— OneBusAway: Results from Providing Real-Time Arrival Information for Public Transit. (2010)— Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery: Google ads, black names and white names, racial discrimination, and click advertising (2013)— Anti Eviction Mapping is a volunteer data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective documenting the dispossession and resistance upon gentrifying landscapes (since 2013) COMS 6998 ALGEBRAIC TECHNIQUES IN CS | Joshua H AlmanAlgebraic techniques have been used in nearly every area of computer science. This course will develop some of these techniques and explore a broad range of applications. We will mostly see applications to algorithm design and complexity theory, but we will touch on applications to other areas as well. The course will focus on four main topics:Algebraic graph algorithms. The fastest known algorithms for several important graph problems use algebraic tools. Often, the graph problem appears (at first glance) to have nothing to do with algebra, and algorithm designers have found surprising algebraic connections.The polynomial method. If one can capture a computational task using a simple polynomial, then fast algorithms for manipulating polynomials can often be used to solve the problem more efficiently. In contrast, if one can show that a task cannot be captured by simple polynomials, this can often be used to prove complexity-theoretic lower bounds.Matrix rigidity. Some of the most important and applicable algorithms are for computing linear transforms such as Fourier transforms. Matrix rigidity is a powerful but poorly understood tool for understanding their complexity. A matrix is called rigid if it cannot be decomposed as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. It remains an open problem to prove that any explicit family of matrices is rigid.Matrix multiplication algorithms. Matrix multiplication is prevalent in computational science and is known to be equivalent to many other computational problems in linear algebra. We will see how fast matrix multiplication algorithms are designed, including some recent developments.Evaluation will be primarily based on a final project. I will provide a list of suggestions for the project, but students are encouraged to relate their project to their interests. There will also be occasional (at most 4) homework assignments, and students will be asked to scribe a lecture.COMS 6998 CLOUD COMPUTING & BIG DAT | Sahu, SambitThis is a graduate-level course on Cloud Computing and Big Data with an emphasis on hands-on design and implementation. You will learn to design and build extremely large-scale systems and learn the underlying principles and building blocks in the design of such large-scale applications. You will be using real Cloud platforms and services to learn the concepts to build such applications.The first part of the course covers basic building blocks such as essential cloud services for web applications, cloud programming, virtualization, containers, kubernetes and micro-services. We shall learn these concepts by using and extending capabilities available in real clouds such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud.The second part of the course will focus on the various stacks used in building an extremely large-scale system, such as (i) Kafka for event logging and handling, (ii) Spark and Spark streaming for large-scale computations, (iii) Elastic Search for extremely fast indexing and search, (iv) various noSQL database services such as DynamoDB, Cassandra, (v) cloud-native with kubernets, (vi) cloud platforms for Machine Learning and Deep Learning based applications. Several real-world applications will be covered to illustrate these concepts and research innovations.Students are expected to participate in class discussions, read research papers, work on three programming assignments, and conduct a significant course project. Given that this is a very hands-on course, it is expected that students have a decent programming background.Prerequisite: Good programming experience in any language, Concepts of Web Applications and SystemsReading Material: Lecture Notes, Reading Papers, Reference Text Books, Lot of Engineering DocsGrading: 3 Programming Assignments (35%), 2 Quizzes (25%), Project (40%)COMS 6998 COMPUTATION AND THE BRAIN | Papadimitriou, ChristosPrerequisites: Familiarity with computation and algorithms. Some familiarity with Neuroscience; or willingness to venture into a vast, complex, and fascinating field. Familiarity with machine learning useful.Despite brilliant and accelerating progress in experimental Neuroscience, there is little progress towards an overarching understanding of how the Brain works. This course will cover some basic material and results in Neuroscience, both classical and recent, from a computational perspective, that is, under the hypothesis that the way the Brain works is largely computational.” COMS 6998 EMPIRICAL METHODS DATA SC | Levine, MichelleEmpirical Methods of Data Science is a seminar for students seeking an in depth understanding of how to conduct empirical research in computer science. In the first part of the seminar, we will discuss how to critically examine previous research, build and test hypotheses, and collect data in the most ethical and robust manner. As we explore different means of data collection, we will dive into ethical concerns in research. Next, we will explore how to most effectively analyze different data sets and how to present the data in engaging and exciting ways. In the last part of the seminar, we will hear from different researchers on the methods they use to conduct research, lending to further conversations and in class debates about when and how to use particular research methods. The focus will be primarily on relatively small data sets but we will also address big data. COMS 6998 FOUNDATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN | Roughgarden, TimothyThis course will provide a rigorous introduction to the mathematical analysis of blockchain protocols, including the relevant tools and definitions from game theory, economics, and distributed computing. The target audience is beginning PhD students with interest and experience in theoretical computer science.COMS 6998 FORMAL VERIFICATION SYSTE | Gu, RonghuiThis course is a graduate seminar on research in the verification of system software. The goal of the class is to get the students to build provably correct software. The structure of the class will consist of students presenting research papers during lecture, and students working on a significant research project. We expect students to start working on the project in the first week or two, and continue for the entire semester, culminating in a draft research paper. Examples of project include building a certified file system, simple OS kernel, hypervisor, database system, etc. We expect projects will build on tools such as Coq, and Z3. To get students up to speed with these tools, we will offer several tutorial lectures on Coq, using parts of the Software Foundations textbook.COMS 6998 FUND SPEECH RECOGNITION | Beigi, HomayoonFundamentals of Speech Recognition is a comprehensive course, covering all aspects of automatic speech recognition from theory to practice. In this course such topics as Anatomy of Speech, Signal Representation, Phonetics and Phonology, Signal Processing and Feature Extraction, Probability Theory and Statistics, Information Theory, Metrics and Divergences, Decision Theory, Parameter Estimation, Clustering and Learning, Transformation, Hidden Markov Modeling, Language Modeling and Natural Language Processing, Search Techniques, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and other recent machine learning techniques used in speech recognition are covered in some detail. Also, several open-source speech recognition software packages are introduced, with detailed hands-on projects using Kaldi to produce a fully functional speech recognition engine. The lectures cover the theoretical aspects as well as practical coding techniques. The course is graded based on a project. The Midterm (40% of the grade is in the form of a two-page proposal for the project, and the final (60% of the grade) is an oral presentation of the project plus a 6-page conference style paper describing the results of the research project. The instructor uses his own Textbook for the course, Homayoon Beigi, “Fundamentals of Speaker Recognition,” Springer-Verlag, New York, 2011. Every week, the slides of the lecture are made available to the students. COMS 6998 HIGH PERF MACH LEARNING | Parijat Dube and Kaoutar El-MaghraouiHPML-Spring2024-SyllabusDuring the past decades, the field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has been about building supercomputers to solve some of the biggest challenges in science. HPC is where cutting edge technology (GPUs, low latency interconnects, etc.) is applied to the solution of scientific and data-driven problems.One of the key ingredients to the current success of ML is the ability to perform computations on very large amounts of training data. Today, the application of HPC techniques to ML algorithms is a fundamental driver for the progress of Artificial Intelligence.In this course, you will learn HPC techniques that are typically applied to supercomputing software, and how they are applied to obtain the maximum performance out of ML algorithms. You will also learn about techniques for building efficient ML systems. The course is based on PyTorch, CUDA programming, MPI.PrerequisitesKnowledge of computer architecture and operating system through course work; C/C++: intermediate programming skills; Python: intermediate programming skills; Knowledge of machine learning concepts and deep learning algorithms through course workTopics coveredML/DL and PyTorch basics, PyTorch performance. Performance optimization in Pytorch, Parallel performance modeling, Intro to CUDA and CUDA programming, Math libraries for ML (cuDNN), DNNs architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM, Attention, Transformers) in Pytorch, Intro to MPI, Distributed ML, Distributed PyTorch algorithms, parallel data loading, and ring reduction, Quantization and model compression, hw/sw co-design and co-optimization of DNNs  COMS E6998 Human-Computer Interaction | Brian SmithThis course is a graduate-level seminar in which we meet once a week to discuss several human–computer interaction (HCI) research papers. We will meet once a week and cover a different research area within HCI each week. The class is open to graduate students and, with instructor permission, undergraduate students.Students will be expected to read all of the papers, write weekly reflections about the papers, and present one or two of them to the class in a presentation that is roughly 20 mins long. In our discussions, we will be talking about the papers themselves as well as the research strategy and methodology behind them.Stanford’s CS 376 is an HCI seminar of similar vein. You can see the following page for their most recent syllabus of papers:https://hcicourses.stanford.edu/cs376/2018/syllabus.php(Note that research seminar courses, including both ours and Stanford’s, tend to change the list of papers covered every year.)Our syllabus will be similar in format, and I will announce the full list of papers on the first day of class.COMS 6998 Internet Measurement (syllabus, COMS, ELEN) | Ethan Katz-BassettIn this course, we will investigate important problems, techniques, results, and challenges that arise in measuring the Internet. We will explore both what measurements tell us about the Internet and how we can leverage what they tell us to improve the Internet and services that run on it. We will learn to measure various aspects of the Internet, including topology, routing and routing policies, performance, failures, traffic, and applications. Researchers often talk about Internet measurement as being analogous to astronomy, in that we take observations from afar in order to understand how a system works. The class will be discussion-based. Students will conduct small research projects in groups — in past offerings of this course, most students published their projects in peer-reviewed venues.COMS 6998 MACHINE LEARNING & CLIMATE | Kucukelbir, AlpIn this course, we will study two aspects of how ml interacts with Earth’s climate.First, we will investigate how ml can be used to tackle climate change. We will focus on use cases from transportation, manufacturing, food and agriculture, waste management, and atmospheric studies. We will ask questions like: what are the requirements for applying ml to such problems? How can we evaluate the effectiveness of our analyses?Second, we will consider ml’s own impact on the climate. We will focus on the energy and computation that goes into designing, training, and deploying modern ml systems. We will ask questions like: how can we accurately track and account for ml’s own energy footprint? What strategies can we employ to minimize it?By the end of this course, you will learn about modern statistical and causal ml methods and their applications to the climate. Our focus will be the modeling of real-world phenomena using probability models, with a focus on vision, time series forecasting, uncertainty quantification, and causality. In addition, you will gain a deeper understanding about the carbon footprint of ml itself and explore how to mitigate it. COMS 6998 NATURAL LANG GEN SUMMARIZ | McKeown, KathleenThere has been tremendous progress recently in the development of models to generate language for different purposes and to produce summaries of input documents. This success has largely come about due to rapid advances in large language models. In this class, we will explore four main topics: language generation, multimodal generation, summarization and long-format question answering. We will study large language models that have been used for these different tasks and issues that arise. For example, how possible is to control the output of these large language models along different dimensions? How do we evaluate the textual output of such systems? How can we develop models to produce or summarize creative texts? What are the ethical issues surrounding these kinds of models?This class will follow a seminar style. It will include a mixture of lectures from the instructor, guest lectures and student presentations. Students who take the class will have three main assignments. 1. For each class there will be a reading assignment consisting of several research papers. Students are responsible for reading all papers. 2. Students will be part of a presentation group which will be responsible for presenting a paper and raising critiques about one or more papers in class. 3. Each student will carry out a semester long project. Each student will be required to submit a proposal for the project near the beginning of class, turn in a midterm progress report and submit a final report and code for their project. They will do a short video presentation which will be made available to the class, the Tas and the instructor for viewing. There will be no midterm or final exam.Pre-requisite: COMS 4705, Natural Language Processing or equivalent. COMS 6998 PRACT DEEP LEARNING SYS P | Dube, ParijatThis course will cover several topics in performance evaluation of machine learning and deep learning systems. Major topics covered in the course: Algorithmic and system level introduction to Deep Learning (DL), DL training algorithms, network architectures, and best practices for performance optimization, ML/DL system stack on cloud, Tools and benchmarks (e.g., DAWNBench) for performance evaluation of ML/DL systems, Practical performance analysis using standard DL frameworks (tensorflow, pytorch) and resource monitoring tools (e.g., nvidia-smi), Performance modeling to characterize scalability with respect to workload and hardware, Performance consideration with special techniques like transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, neural architecture search. Emphasis will be on getting working knowledge of tools and techniques to evaluate performance of ML/DL systems on cloud platforms. The assignments will involve running experiments using standard DL frameworks (tensorflow, pytorch) and working with open source DL technologies. The students will gain practical experience working on different stages of DL life cycle (development and deployment) and understanding/addressing related system performance issues.COMS 6998 QUANTUM COMPLEXITY CRYPTO | Yuen, HenryCourse WebsiteThis is an advanced, PhD-level topics class in the theory of quantum computing, focusing in particular on cutting-edge topics in quantum complexity theory and quantum cryptography. The theme of the topics this year will beComplexity of quantum states and state transformations. An n-qubit quantum state appears to be exponentially more complex than an n-bit string; a classical description of such a state requires writing down 2n complex amplitudes in general. Here are some questions that will motivate our explorations:How does this complexity manifest itself in different information-processing tasks?How can we quantify this complexity?Can this complexity be used for cryptographic applications?Does the complexity of quantum states relate to traditional concepts in complexity theory such as circuit complexity or space complexity or time complexity?A list of possible topics:Shadow tomography of quantum statesQuantum state synthesis/unitary synthesisHamiltonian learningQuantum key distribution/quantum moneyQMA(2) and the power of unentanglementState complexity, AdS/CFT, and quantum gravityQuantum state complexity and statistical zero knowledgePseudorandom states and unitariesClassical vs. quantum proofsThe following notes from Scott Aaronson will be frequently consulted: https://www.scottaaronson.com/barbados-2016.pdf.The goal is to explore the results and (more importantly) the questions in this field. Course work may include: scribe notes, a few assignments, and a course project.PrerequisitesMust have taken: Basic linear algebra and basic probability theory.You must have taken at least one of:An upper-level CS theory course such as complexity theory/cryptography/algorithms, orQuantum computing, orQuantum physics.It is not required that you have taken a course in quantum computing/quantum information before, but it would definitely be helpful. The lectures will introduce the concepts as needed, but will go rather quickly.The course will expect high levels of mathematical maturity and comfort with proofs. To get a sense of what this course is like, take a look at the lecture notes from this Fall 2020 topics course. COMS 6998 READINGS LANGUAGE DESIGN | Bjarne StroustrupThis course involves reading, presenting, and discussing papers on programming language design. In the first lecture, I outline some dimensions of language design and give examples of aims and ideals that have driven the development of languages. I also present a (necessarily incomplete) list of classical design papers. In the second lecture, I present a paper for discussion to give an idea of how that may be done. This is not a comparative languages class nor a type-theory class. The focus on presentations should be on ideals, aims, and principles so that language features are presented simply as examples. For older languages it is possible and desirable to discuss how the ideas worked out in actual use and evolved. Uncritical “sales jobs” of languages – as are not uncommon in early descriptions of new languages – are not acceptable as presentations. You might, of course, choose to present your favorite language, but maintain a critical and objective perspective.COMS 6998 REPRESENTATION LEARNING | Vondrick, CarlThe course will discuss the latest research in representation learning. Each week, we will discuss a topic by reading papers in computer vision, NLP, machine learning, and robotics. Attendance is required and every student will be expected to speak during each class.COMS 6998 SECURITY ROBUSTNESS ML SY | Yang, JunfengOver the past few years, Machine Learning (DL) has made tremendous progress, achieving or surpassing human-level performance for a diverse set of tasks including image classification, speech recognition, and playing games such as Go. These advances have led to widespread adoption and deployment of ML in security- and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars, malware detection, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. This wide adoption of DL techniques presents new challenges as the predictability and correctness of such systems are of crucial importance. Unfortunately, ML systems, despite their impressive capabilities, often demonstrate unexpected or incorrect behaviors in corner cases for several reasons such as biased training data, overfitting, and underfitting of the models. In safety- and security-critical settings, such incorrect behaviors can lead to disastrous consequences such as a fatal collision of a self-driving car. For example, a Google self-driving car recently crashed into a bus because it expected the bus to yield under a set of rare conditions but the bus did not. A Tesla car in autopilot crashed into a trailer because the autopilot system failed to recognize the trailer as an obstacle due to its “white color against a brightly lit sky” and the “high ride height.” Such corner cases were not part of Google’s or Tesla’s test set and thus never showed up during testing. Other examples include Microsoft’s Tay chatbot tweeting racist words because it was misled by malicious twitter users, and Google removing “gorilla” as an image class after its image classification algorithm incorrectly classified dark skined people as gorillas.These challenges have drawn huge attention from researchers in machine learning, security, systems, and programming language communities. A number of techniques and theories have been proposed to increase the robustness and security of machine learning. In this course, we will study the most practical and most important of these techniques and theories with a focus on deep learning. For details on the topics we’ll cover, please go to the Course Syllabus page.COMS 6998 SYS FOR HUMAN DATA INTERA | Wu, EugeneHuman Data Interaction studies the interface between humans and data. What types of interfaces are suitable for different data tasks? Further, creating human data interfaces is extremely challenging because the responsiveness of the interface directly depends on the system architecture as well as the interface design. What system innovations are needed to simplify how effective human data interfaces can be created and used?Human Data Interaction is a nascent field, and we will study modern research in data visualization, HCI, data analysis, and data management systems. This seminar course will center around reading, reviewing, and discussing research papers. Each session will consist of a round table discussion of the week’s readings to understand the context, the technical details, and to brain storm follow up research questions. Students will work in small teams on a semester-long research project that is within the scope of the course topic.COMS 6998: The Economics of Cyber Security| Adam Hastings & Simha SethumadhavanPrerequisites: COMS 4181 or equivalent; and at least two additional COMS or CSEE 41xx or 48xx classes or equivalent with instructor approval.Description: Designing modern computer systems requires computer systems engineers to balance factors of human behavior, ethics, incentives, economics, policy, laws, and regulations, in addition to traditional engineering requirements like performance, cost, scalability, and security. This class will prepare computer systems engineers to design systems to meet these modern, multi-faceted needs.COMS 6998 TOPICS IN CLOUD COMPUTING \\ Kostis KaffesOne of the most significant transformations in the computer sector over the last decade has been the rise of cloud computing. Companies are progressively transferring their tasks to external cloud platforms and utilizing advanced global services that were previously unattainable within individual data centers. Nonetheless, the construction and utilization of cloud systems entails tackling numerous intricate research challenges. This research seminar will explore both industrial and academic contributions to cloud computing. Participants will engage in guest presentations delivered by prominent authorities in the field, analyze and guide discussions on research papers, and collaborate in small groups to undertake a research project throughout the semester.COMS 6998: Topics in Mobile X | Xia ZhouPrerequisites: Because this is a high-level course, we assume that students already have a solid understanding of the basics of some areas, including networking, communication, and machine learning. There are multiple ways of demonstrating a networking and machine learning background, including taking undergraduate networking classes, machine learning classes, or equivalent classes, and experiences of working on related projects. The course project is an important part of this class. Students must have good programming skills and project experience.Abstract: Topics in Mobile X is an upper-level course on mobile computing and ubiquitous systems, covering a broad range of advanced and interdisciplinary topics in mobile computing, networking, and applications. All these topics center on unique challenges faced on bringing computation, networking, and applications to the mobile computing platform — a platform that is constrained in form factor, energy, and computation power, with examples such as smartphones, smart watches or wrist bands, smart glasses, and more. Example topics include mobile communication and networking, mobile sensing, mobile human-to-computer interaction (HCI), mobile learning/AI, and mobile security.For each topic, we will study both conventional perspectives and recent research trends. Students will learn key principles in mobile computing research, understand the state of the art in this research area, and gain experience of carrying out original research through class projects. The end goal is to generate publishable results by the end of the term. In addition, students will practice their skills in paper reading/writing and public presentation in the form of weekly research essays, class discussions, paper critiques, project reports and presentations.As a research-oriented course, this course is based on research papers in top-tier conferences. No particular textbooks are required, but following textbooks are good references for students to refresh networking background and better understand papers.Theodore Rappaport.

Equivalents acceptableCOMS E6998 Virtual Technologies for Cloud Computing | Jason NiehPrerequisites: COMS 4118 Operating Systems or the equivalent.This course will cover the underlying technologies that enable major cloud computing providers to deliver computing resources to consumers on-demand over the Internet, focusing primarily on virtualization and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud models. Topics to be covered will include many aspects of the design and implementation of hypervisors and containers, ranging from architectural support for virtualization to live migration to cloud computing security. The course will have homework assignments and a final project, both of which will involve systems programming.COMS 6998: Unconditional Lower Bounds and Derandomization | Rocco ServedioPrerequisites: The most important prerequisite is “mathematical maturity”; you should be comfortable with proofs, basic discrete math, combinatorics, probability, and linear algebra. If you have questions about your mathematical readiness you should contact the instructor before enrolling. COMS 4236 (Introduction to Computational Complexity) is good preparation, but this is not required.The course will not include any programming.Description: This is a course about unconditional lower bounds and complexity-theoretic pseudorandom generators for restricted models of computation. We will study many unconditional lower bounds and derandomization results for interesting and important models of computation, covering various “gens” of the field that have been discovered over the past few decades. There will be an emphasis on techniques and we will highlight many open questions along the way.http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rocco/Teaching/S24/COMS 6998 VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY | Feiner, StevenThis course will cover selected topics in VR and AR. There are two main components, with everyone participating in both: papers and projects.Papers: Throughout the semester, we will be reading, presenting, and discussing papers that address important research themes in VR and AR. Each of you will be individually responsible for reading and commenting on all the papers and for participating in a team presentation of a selected set of papers related to one theme.Projects: You will be developing a project in a small (individual or 2-3 person) team using the Unity 3D development environment. Projects will use either headset-based VR or phone-based AR. Through the generosity of a Provost Emerging Technology Grant, I expect to lend an Oculus Quest to each of you doing a headset-based VR project. Thus, members of all team projects can work remotely from each other without needing to share equipment. While you can generate your own project idea, I will encourage you to choose from a collection of projects co-advised with faculty and students in other schools, ranging from Medicine and Dentistry, to Social Work.Prerequisites: You will ideally have taken COMS W4172 (3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality) or equivalent and be comfortable with developing in Unity. However, I am willing to admit students who don’t have this background, with the understanding that you will need to get up to speed with Unity, starting early in September.Please fill out the survey linked to the course SSOL entry, which is a necessary precondition to being admitted to the course.

The class combines lectures in basic computer science with lectures and projects applying those methods to multiple disciplines within the liberal arts, including digital humanities, social science, and econ financing. For more information, see It’s a Computing Revolution in the Liberal Arts.Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists (ENGI E1006) introduces computational thinking, algorithmic problem solving, and Python programming with projects designed around applications in science and engineering. Intended for first-year SEAS students.Emerging Scholars Program (COMS W1404) is a 1-point, pass/fail, semester-long program that concentrates on the collaborative and problem-solving aspects of computer science. Weekly workshops give students an extra opportunity to explore CS-related topics and fields.                              Previous Years:    2021 - 2022     |     2022 - 2023     |     2023 - 2024     |     2024 -

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Additionally, this policy addresses those aspects of academic honesty that are especially related to the use of computers and other electronic devices.In order to enforce the principles of fairness and proportionality while also ensuring uniform departmental standards, the Department separates disciplinary penalties from academic ones. The penalties of warning, probation, suspension, and expulsion are administered by the deans. Grading penalties are administered by its instructors.GENERAL POLICIESUnless specifically authorized by the instructor, all coursework is to be done by the student working alone. Unless specifically authorized by the instructor, no external aids or electronic devices are allowed during exams.An instructor may refine academic honesty as appropriate for the course. As an example, instructors may specify rules regarding the conditions under which work done by other people, or by the student previously, can be incorporated into an assignment, project, or exam. Violations will be subject to the standard academic and disciplinary penalties. If group work is permitted by an instructor, academic honesty policies continue to apply on a student-by-student basis; the full team is not necessarily held responsible for an individual’s violations.Instructors are asked to promulgate and permit student exploration of the Department’s policy at the beginning of every course. They are to announce in class or by website that, by taking the course, the student is presumed to be aware of the Departmental policy, and that the text of the policy can be found on the Department’s web pages. However, regardless of any question of instructor announcement or student discussion, student understanding of the policy is assumed. Additional documentation concerning academic honesty issues, some provided by the deans, is also available on the Department’s web pages.The Academic Committee maintains for instructor reference a secure list of academic honesty violators, which records their academic penalties, and also, when permitted by the student’s school, their disciplinary penalties. Among other penalties, students found in violation of academic honesty rules by the deans may be prohibited from serving as departmental Teaching Assistants, from receiving departmental financial support, and from being recognized with departmental awards. However, instructors who wish to refer to such a violation in a letter of recommendation requested by such a student must first ask for the student’s permission to disclose the violation. Instructors must not mention the violation if permission is denied. (As always, writing letters of recommendation is the prerogative of the instructor.)PROCEDURES AND PENALTIESIf an instructor suspects academic dishonesty, the instructor contacts the student or students involved and asks for explanations. The instructor can request a meeting with the student or students, who may be seen individually or as a group, and with or without witnesses. If the explanations appear inadequate, the instructor informs the student or students that academic dishonesty is suspected, applies the appropriate academic penalties and registers the penalties with the Academic Committee, and reports the incident to the appropriate dean or deans together with a written summary of the investigation. An instructor may also choose to defer the academic penalty until the investigation has been completed; in some cases, this may result in a course grade of INC until the matter is resolved.In general, the academic penalty for a first offense of academic dishonesty within the Department is a grade of zero on the assignment, project, or exam, or reduction of the course grade at the discretion of the instructor. In general, the academic penalty for second and subsequent offenses — across all courses within the Department — results in failure of the course. An instructor may immediately fail a student for sufficiently severe infractions. The appendix to this policy gives examples.Students may appeal academic penalties in writing to the Academic Committee within 10 business days, or in those cases investigated by the deans, within 10 business days of the deans’ decision. The committee solicits from the instructor and from witnesses additional written statements. The committee then forwards its recommendations to the instructor.The deans may pursue a separate investigation. This helps expose any pattern of academic dishonesty that occurs across the university’s courses. The deans follow the rules and procedures of their schools, available on their websites or in their bulletins. In general, they conduct a hearing with the students, and if appropriate, with the instructor, and determine the appropriate disciplinary action. The disciplinary penalty may include suspension or expulsion. The deans inform the instructor of their decision; this may further influence any academic penalty, and in particular, may resolve a temporary course grade of INC. The appeals process for disciplinary penalties is specified by each school and is available in each school’s publications.Academic assessments outside of coursework are covered by this policy.  Examples include exams administered to test a student’s knowledge (e.g., comprehensive exams, qualifying exams, candidacy exams), thesis proposals, and theses. In such a case, the policies and procedures described above apply, with the role of “instructor” played by a person or committee administering the assessment. The University’s Research Misconduct policy also applies.AUTHORIZATIONThis document has been approved by the faculty of the Department of Computer Science, by the Deans of Student Affairs of the relevant schools of the University, and by the University’s General Counsel.APPENDIX: EXAMPLES OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTYAcademic dishonesty is suspected if an assignment calling for independent design and implementation results in two or more essentially similar solutions, or in a solution that can not be explained to the instructor in terms of general method or specific techniques.It is impossible to define completely what constitutes academic dishonesty. However, the following examples, while not exhaustive, should almost always be judged to be in their appropriate categories. In cases of uncertainty, it is the student’s responsibility to ascertain from the instructors whether an activity is allowed. In general, that decision is reserved to the instructors, and can not be made by their assistants.NOT ACADEMIC DISHONESTYA student submitting original work done alone or with the help of the instructor or the assistants.Students solving a problem as a group in which group work is permitted, and submitting one copy of work as group work, identifying each member of the groupA student receiving help on the use of a feature of the operating system or of system programs such as compilersStudents discussing the intention, as opposed to the solution method, of a problemStudents discussing course material for the sake of understanding.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

The faculty in the department conduct research in all areas of computer science. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy requires a dissertation based on the candidate’s original research, which is supervised by a faculty member, and all students in the Ph.D. program are actively engaged in research throughout the program. Ph.D. students spend at least half of their time on research under the direction of their faculty adviser from their first day in the program and devote themselves full time to research after coursework and other preliminaries have been completed. Ph.D. students are also expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities full time throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere, and the department does not consider admission of part-time Ph.D. students.DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION FOR DOCTORAL STUDENTSProgram RequirementsMS leading to PhDMilestones ChartMilestones Registration Form: Candidacy, Thesis Proposal, Thesis DefensePhD course Import FormsPhD Algorithms Prerequisite FormData Science Specialization Option  (further details here)PhD RepsAwardsSCHOOL/UNIVERSITY INFORMATION FOR DOCTORAL STUDENTSRegistrationSEAS Doctoral Fieldwork (CPT) PolicyTime-Off Policy for Doctoral Students on Appointment in the Sciences and Related Research FieldsGENERAL PHD INFORMATION AND ADVICECAREER ClubComputer Science Open DataComputer Science Graduate Job and Interview GuideBackground in case you ever need to teach online with two days noticeThe Definitive ‘what do I ask/look for’ in a PhD Advisor GuideThe Thesis WhispererPrem Devanbu’s Review Anti-PatternsComputer Science RankingsMichael Ernst’s Compilation of Great AdviceProductivity Tips for PhD StudentsGetting Admitted to a Top PhD ProgramTips on the Interview ProcessNetworking on the networkAdvice on research and writingMore advice on writingCorporate Lab or Academic Department, Which Fits?How To Survive A Thesis DefensePhD comics10 easy ways to fail a PhDDealing with plagiarismAcademic job siteComputing Research AssociationACMIEEE Computer SocietyUsenixAAAI(link suggestions appreciated; send email to phd-chair@cs.columbia.edu)Last updated on March 13, 2024.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Many choose to combine computer science with a second career interest by pursuing additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies.DEGREE PROGRAM QUICK GUIDES                                                                                BS in Computer Science (SEAS)                                                         New BS Curriculum Quick Guide – Students declaring in Fall 2023 or later must follow this.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

by President Bollinger                            President Bollinger announced that Columbia University along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all Ivy League universities) filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the Executive Order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

To bridge the gap between artificial intelligence research and the daily lives of people, this thesis explores leveraging advancements in the field of computer vision to enhance human experiences related to movement. Through two projects, I leverage computer vision to aid Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people in perceiving sports gameplay, and provide navigation assistance for pedestrians in outdoor urban environments. I present Front Row, a system that enables BLV viewers to interpret tennis matches through immersive audio cues, along with StreetNav, a system that repurposes street cameras for real-time, precise outdoor navigation assistance and environmental awareness. User studies and technical evaluations demonstrate the potential of these systems in augmenting people’s experiences perceiving and interacting with movement. This exploration also uncovers challenges in deploying such solutions along with opportunities in the design of future technologies.

Machine learning models have surfaced as valuable tools in this context, showcasing notable effectiveness in supporting healthcare delivery. Despite advancements, a gap remains in real-time medical interventions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FIDDLE-Rx, a novel, data-driven machine learning approach designed specifically for real-time medication recommendations in ICUs. This method leverages the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for its analysis, which encompasses diverse electronic health records from ICUs (ICU-EHRs) sourced from multiple critical care centers across the US. FIDDLE-Rx employs the Flexible Data-Driven Pipeline (FIDDLE) for transforming tabular data into binary matrix representations and standardizes medication labels using the RxNorm (Rx) API. With the processed dataset, FIDDLE-Rx applies various machine learning models to forecast the requirements for 238 medications. Compared with previous studies, FIDDLE-Rx stands out by extending the scope of the research of ICU-EHRs beyond mortality prediction, offering a more comprehensive approach to enhancing critical care. The experimental results of our models demonstrate high efficacy, evidenced by their impressive performance across two key metrics: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Remarkably, these results were achieved even when the model was trained with just 20% of the database, underlining its strong generalizability. By broadening the scope of ICU-EHRs research to encompass real-time medication recommendations, FIDDLE-Rx presents a scalable and effective solution for improving patient care in intensive care environments.

Robots are now beginning to operate in unknown and highly nonlinear environments, expanding their usefulness for everyday tasks. In contrast, classical control theory is not suitable for these unknown, nonlinear environments. However, it retains an immense advantage over traditional deep reinforcement learning: guaranteed satisfaction of hard constraints, which is critically important for the performance and safety of robots.\r\rThis thesis introduces Koopman Constrained Policy Optimization (KCPO), combining implicitly differentiable model predictive control with a deep Koopman autoencoder. KCPO brings new optimality guarantees to robot learning in unknown and nonlinear dynamical systems.\r\rThe use of KCPO is demonstrated in Simple Pendulum and Cartpole with continuous state and action spaces and unknown environments. KCPO is shown to be able to train policies end-to-end with hard box constraints on controls. Compared to several baseline methods, KCPO exhibits superior generalization to constraints that were not part of its training.

While formal verification offers a potential\rsolution for secure concurrent systems software, existing approaches\rhave not been able to prove the correctness of systems software on Arm\rrelaxed memory hardware. We introduce VRM, a new framework that can be\rused to verify kernel-level system software which satisfies a set of\rsynchronization and memory access properties such that these programs\rcan be mostly verified on a sequentially consistent hardware model and\rthe proofs will automatically hold on Arm relaxed memory hardware. VRM\rcan be used to verify concurrent kernel code that is not data race\rfree, which is typical for kernel code responsible for managing shared\rpage tables. Using VRM, we prove for the first time the security\rguarantees of a retrofitted implementation of the Linux KVM\rmultiprocessor hypervisor on Arm. For multiple versions of KVM, we\rprove KVM’s security properties on a sequentially consistent model,\rthen prove that KVM satisfies VRM’s required program properties such\rthat its security proofs hold for Arm relaxed memory hardware. Our\rexperimental results across multiple verified KVM versions show that\rthe retrofit does not adversely affect the scalability of verified\rKVM, as it performs comparably to unmodified KVM when running many\rvirtual machines concurrently with real application workloads on Arm\rserver hardware.

We consider diverse problems ranging from landmarking to deep dictionary learning, pan-sharpening, compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging and microgrid control, introducing novelties that go beyond the state of the art for the problems we discuss.\r\rWe start by introducing a manifold landmarking approach trainable via stochastic gradient descent that allows for the consideration of structural regularization terms in the objective. We extend the approach for semi-supervised learning problems, showing that it is able to achieve comparable or better results than equivalent $k$-means based approaches. Inspired by these results, we consider an extension of this approach for general supervised and semi-supervised classification for structurally similar deep neural networks with self-modulating radial basis kernels.\r\rSecondly, we consider convolutional networks that perform image-to-image mappings for the problems of pan-sharpening and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging. Using extensions of deep state of the art image-to-image mapping architectures specifically tailored for these problems, we show that they could be addressed naturally and effectively.\r\rAfter this, we move on to describe a method for multilayer dictionary learning and feedforward sparse coding by formulating the dictionary learning problem using a general deep learning layer architecture inspired by analysis dictionary learning. We find this method to be significantly faster to train than classical online dictionary learning approaches and capable of addressing supervised and semi-supervised classification problems more naturally. \r\rLastly, we look at the problem of per-user power supply delivery on a microgrid powered by solar energy. Using real-world data obtained via The Earth Institute, we consider the problem of deciding the amount of power to supply to all each user for a certain period of time given their current power demand as well as past demand/supply data. We approach the problem as one of demand-to-supply mapping, providing results for a policy network trained via regular propagation for worst-case control  and classical deep reinforcement learning.

To complete this task, the algorithm should simultaneously locate and navigate to an instance of the category. In comparison to the traditional point goal navigation, this task requires the agent to have a stronger contextual prior to indoor environments. This thesis introduces SSCNav, an algorithm that explicitly models scene priors using a confidence-aware semantic scene completion module to complete the scene and guide the agent’s navigation planning. Given a partial observation of the environment, SSCNav first infers a complete scene representation with semantic labels for the unobserved scene together with a confidence map associated with its own prediction. Then, a policy network infers the action from the scene completion result and confidence map. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed scene completion module improves the efficiency of the downstream navigation policies.

In this work, we aim to better understand the semantic representation of GANs, and thereby enable semantic control in GAN’s generation process. Interestingly, we find that a well-trained GAN encodes image semantics in its internal feature maps in a surprisingly simple way: a linear transformation of feature maps suffices to extract the generated image semantics.\rTo verify this simplicity, we conduct extensive experiments on various GANs and datasets; and thanks to this simplicity, we are able to learn a semantic segmentation model for a trained GAN from a small number (e.g., 8) of labeled images. Last but not least, leveraging our findings, we propose two few-shot image editing approaches, namely Semantic-Conditional Sampling and Semantic Image Editing. Given an unsupervised GAN and as few as eight semantic annotations, the user is able to generate diverse images subject to a user-provided semantic layout, and control the synthesized image semantics.

Accelerators have become available on many different systems from the cloud to embedded systems. This modern computing paradigm makes specialized hardware available at scale in a way it never has before. \r\rWhile accelerators have shown great efficiency in terms of power consumption and performance, matching software functions with the best available hardware remains problematic without manual selection. Since there is some software representation of each accelerator's function, selection can be automated via code analysis. Static similarity analysis has traditionally been based on solving satisfiable modulo theorems (SMT), but continuous logic networks (CLNs) have provided a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional SMT-solving by replacing boolean functions with smooth estimations. These smooth estimates create the opportunity to leverage gradient descent to learn the solution. \rWe present AccFinder, the first CLN-based code similarity solution and evaluate its effectiveness on a realistically complex accelerator benchmark.

Software developers are often tasked to work with unfamiliar code in order to remove security vulnerabilities, port and refactor legacy code, and enhance software with new features desired by users. Automatic identification of behavioral clones, or behaviorally-similar code, is one program comprehension technique that can provide developers with assistance. The idea is to identify other code that \"does the same thing\" and that may be more intuitive; better documented; or familiar to the developer, to help them understand the code at hand. Unlike the detection of syntactic or structural code clones, behavioral clone detection requires executing workloads or test cases to find code that executes similarly on the same inputs. However, a key problem in behavioral clone detection that has not received adequate attention is the \"preponderance of the evidence\" problem, which advocates for more convincing evidence from nontrivial test case executions to gain confidence in the behavioral similarities. In other words, similar outputs for some inputs matter more than for others. We present a novel system, SABER, to address the \"preponderance of the evidence\" problem, for which we adapt the legal metaphor of \"more likely to be true than not true\" burden of proof. We develop a novel test case generation methodology with three primary dynamic analysis techniques for identifying important behavioral clones. Further, we investigate filtering and weighting schemes to guide developers toward the most convincing behavioral similarities germane to specific software engineering tasks, such as code review, debugging, and introducing new features.

Their growing complexity poses a security risk. To enable formal verification over such a large code base, we present MicroV, a microverification approach for verifying commodity multiprocessor hypervisors. MicroV retrofits an existing, full-featured hypervisor, into a large collection of untrusted hypervisor services, and a small, verifiable hypervisor core. MicroV introduces security-preserving layers to gradually prove that the implementation of the core refines its high-level layered specification, and ensure that security guarantees proven at the top layer are propagated down through all the layers, such that they hold for the entire implementation. MicroV supports proving noninterference in the sanctioned presence of encrypted data sharing, using data oracles to distinguish between intentional and unintentional information flow. Using MicroV, we retrofitted the Linux KVM hypervisor with only modest modifications to its code base and verify in Coq that the retrofitted KVM protects the confidentiality and integrity of VM data. Our work is the first machine-checked security proof for a commodity multiprocessor hypervisor.

Then the developers need to test whether their candidate\rpatch indeed fixes the bug, without breaking other functionality,\rwhile racing to deploy before cyberattackers pounce on exposed\ruser installations. This can be challenging when the bug discovery\rwas due to factors that arose, perhaps transiently, in a specific user\renvironment. If recording execution traces when the bad behavior\roccurred, record-replay technology faithfully replays the execution,\rin the developer environment, as if the program were executing\rin that user environment under the same conditions as the bug\rmanifested. This includes intermediate program states dependent\ron system calls, memory layout, etc. as well as any externally-visible\rbehavior. So the bug is reproduced, and many modern record-replay\rtools also integrate bug reproduction with interactive debuggers to\rhelp locate the root cause, but how do developers check whether\rtheir patch indeed eliminates the bug under those same conditions?\rState-of-the-art record-replay does not support replaying candidate patches that modify the program in ways that diverge program\rstate from the original recording, but successful repairs necessarily\rdiverge so the bug no longer manifests. This work builds on recordreplay, and binary rewriting, to automatically generate and run\rtests for candidate patches. These tests reflect the arbitrary (ad hoc)\ruser and system circumstances that uncovered the vulnerability, to\rcheck whether a patch indeed closes the vulnerability but does not\rmodify the corresponding segment of the program’s core semantics. Unlike conventional ad hoc testing, each test is reproducible\rand can be applied to as many prospective patches as needed until\rdevelopers are satisfied. The proposed approach also enables users\rto make new recordings of her own workloads with the original\rversion of the program, and automatically generate and run the\rcorresponding ad hoc tests on the patched version, to validate that\rthe patch does not introduce new problems before adopting.

Two such sensors are the accelerometer and gyroscope, which measure acceleration in all three spatial dimensions and rotation along the three axes of the smartphone, respectively. These sensors are often used by gaming and fitness apps. Unlike other sensors deemed to carry sensitive user data, such as GPS, camera, and microphone, the accelerometer and gyroscope do not require user permission on Android to transmit data to apps. This paper presents our IRB-approved studies showing that the accelerometer and gyroscope gather sufficient data to quickly infer the user's gender. We started with 33 in-person participants, with 88% accuracy, and followed up with 259 on-line participants to show the effectiveness of our technique. Our unobtrusive ShakyHands technique draws on these sensors to deduce additional demographic attributes that might be considered sensitive information, notably pregnancy. We have implemented ShakyHands for Android as an app, available from Google Play store, and as a Javascript browser web-app for Android and iOS smartphones. We show that even a low-skilled attacker, without expertise in signal processing or deep learning, can succeed at inferring demographic information such as gender and pregnancy. Our approach does not require tampering with the victim's device or specialized hardware; all our study participants used their own phones.

Edwards                    2019-08-04                    The goal of the FHW project was to produce a compiler able to translate programs written in\ra functional language (we chose Haskell) into synthesizable RTL (we chose SystemVerilog)\rsuitable for execution on an FPGA or ASIC that was highly parallel. We ultimately produced\rsuch a compiler, relying on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) as a front-end and writing\rour own back-end that performed a series of lowering transformations to restructure such\rconstructs as recursion, polymorphism, and frst-order functions, into a form suitable for\rhardware, then transform the now-restricted functional IR into a datafow representation that\ris then finally transformed into synthesizable SystemVerilog.

Many HLS systems produce efficient hardware designs for regular algorithms (i.e., those with limited conditionals or regular memory access patterns), but most struggle with irregular algorithms that rely on dynamic, data-dependent memory access patterns (e.g., traversing pointer-based structures like lists, trees, or graphs). HLS tools typically provide imperative, side-effectful languages to the designer, which makes it difficult to correctly specify and optimize complex, memory-bound\rapplications.\r\rIn this dissertation, I present an alternative HLS methodology that leverages properties of functional languages to synthesize hardware for irregular algorithms. The main contribution is an optimizing compiler that translates pure functional programs into modular, parallel dataflow networks in hardware. I give an overview of this compiler, explain how its source and target together enable parallelism in the face of irregularity, and present two specific optimizations that further exploit this parallelism. Taken together, this dissertation verifies my thesis that pure functional programs exhibiting irregular memory access patterns can be compiled into specialized hardware and optimized for parallelism.\r\rThis work extends the scope of modern HLS toolchains. By relying on properties of pure functional languages, our compiler can synthesize hardware from programs containing constructs that commercial HLS tools prohibit, e.g., recursive functions and dynamic memory allocation. Hardware designers may thus use our compiler in conjunction with existing HLS systems to accelerate a wider class of algorithms than before.

While in many cases\rMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approaches work well for text summarization, they\rtend to suffer from poor generalization. We show that techniques which expose the model\rto more opportunities to learn from data tend to generalize better and generate summaries\rwith less lead bias. In our experiments we show that out of the box these new models do\rnot perform significantly better than MLE when evaluated using Rouge, however do possess\rinteresting properties which may be used to assemble more sophisticated and better performing\rsummarization systems.\rThe main theme of the thesis is getting machine learning models to generalize better using\rideas from reinforcement learning. We develop a new labeling scheme inspired by Reward\rAugmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) methods developed originally for the machine\rtranslation task, and discuss how difficult it is to develop models which sample from their\rown distribution while estimating the gradient e.g. in Minimum Risk Training (MRT) and\rReinforcement Learning Policy Gradient methods. We show that RAML can be seen as a\rcompromise between direct optimization of the model towards optimal expected reward using\rMonte Carlo methods which may fail to converge, and standard MLE methods which fail to\rexplore the entire space of summaries, overfit during training by capturing prominent position\rfeatures and thus perform poorly on unseen data.\rTo that end we describe and show results of domain transfer experiments, where we train\rthe model on one dataset and evaluate on another, and position distribution experiments, in\rwhich we show how the distribution of positions of our models differ from the distribution in\rMLE. We also show that our models work better on documents which are less lead biased,\rwhile standard MLE models get significantly worse performance on those documents in particular.\rAnother topic covered in the thesis is Query Focused text summarization, where a search\rquery is used to produce a summary with the query in mind. The summary needs to be relevant\rto the query, rather than solely contain important information from the document. We use\rii\rthe recently published Squad dataset and adapt it for the Query Focused summarization task.\rWe also train deep learning Query Focused models for summarization and discuss problems\rassociated with that approach. Finally we describe a method to reuse an already trained QA\rmodel for the Query Focused text summarization by introducing a reduction of the QA task\rinto the Query Focused text summarization.

Existing email encryption \rapproaches are comprehensive but seldom used due to their complexity \rand inconvenience. We take a new approach to simplify email encryption \rand improve its usability by implementing receiver-controlled \rencryption: newly received messages are transparently downloaded and \rencrypted to a locally-generated key; the original message is then \rreplaced. To avoid the problem of users having to move a single private \rkey between devices, we implement per-device key pairs: only public \rkeys need be synchronized to a single device. Compromising an email account \ror email server only provides access to encrypted emails.

Rivest                    2018-05-10                    The debate over \"exceptional access\"--the government’s ability to read encrypted data--has been going on for many years and shows no signs of resolution any time soon. On the one hand, some people claim it can be accomplished safely; others dispute that. In an attempt to make progress, a National Academies study committee propounded a framework to use when analyzing proposed solutions. We apply that framework to the CLEAR protocol and show the limitations of the design.

Grasp planning is a subset of this problem which can be solved through complex geometric and physical analysis or computationally expensive data driven analysis. As grasping problems become more difficult, building analytical models becomes challenging. Consequently, we aim to learn a grasping policy through a simulation-based data driven approach. In this paper, we create and execute tests to evaluate simulator’s suitability for manipulating objects in highly constrained settings. We investigate methods for creating forward models of a robot’s dynamics, and apply a Model Free Reinforcement Learning approach with the goal of developing a grasping policy based solely on proprioception.

POS uses a novel priority-based scheduling algorithm that naturally considers partial order information dynamically, and guarantees that each partial order will be explored with significant probability. This probabilistic guarantee of error detection is exponentially better than state-of-the-art sampling approaches. Besides theoretical guarantees, POS is extremely simple and lightweight to implement. Evaluations show that POS is effective in covering the partial-order space of micro-benchmarks and finding concurrency bugs in real-world programs such as Firefox’s JavaScript engine SpiderMonkey.

This lens\rarray is then stretched using a small mechanical motion in order to change the field of view\rof the system. We present in this paper the characterization of such a system and simulations\rwhich demonstrate the capabilities of stretchcam. We follow this with the presentation of images\rcaptured from a prototype device of the proposed design. Our prototype system is able to achieve\r1.5 times zoom when the scene is only 300 mm away with only a 3% change of the lens array’s\roriginal length.

To manage an IoT device, the user first needs to join it to an existing network. Then, the IoT device has to be authenticated by the user. The authentication process often requires a two-way communication between the new device and a trusted entity, which is typically a hand- held device owned by the user. To ease and standardize this process, we present the Device Enrollment Protocol (DEP) as a solution to the enrollment problem described above. Starting from DEP, we then showcase the design of an IoT device commissioner and its prototype implementation on Android, named Android Commissioner. The application allows the user to authenticate IoT devices and join them to an existing protected network.

However, RNNs are still often used as a black box with limited understanding of the hidden representation that they learn.  Existing approaches such as visualization are limited by the manual effort to examine the visualizations and require considerable expertise, while neural attention models change, rather than interpret, the model. We propose a technique to search for neurons based on existing interpretable models, features, or programs.

This fault tolerance is enticing on implementing a principled SMR system that replicates general programs, especially server programs that demand high availability. Unfortunately, SMR assumes deterministic execution, but most server programs are multithreaded and thus non-deterministic. Moreover, existing SMR systems provide narrow state machine interfaces to suit specific programs, and it can be quite strenuous and error-prone to orchestrate a general program into these interfaces This paper presents CRANE, an SMR system that trans- parently replicates general server programs. CRANE achieves distributed consensus on the socket API, a common interface to almost all server programs. It leverages deterministic multithreading (specifically, our prior system PARROT) to make multithreaded replicas deterministic. It uses a new technique we call time bubbling to efficiently tackle a difficult challenge of non-deterministic network input timing. Evaluation on five widely used server programs (e.g., Apache, ClamAV, and MySQL) shows that CRANE is easy to use, has moderate overhead, and is robust.

Obfuscators might hide the true intent of code by renaming variables, modifying the control flow of methods, or inserting additional code. Prior approaches toward automated deobfuscation of Android applications have relied on certain structural parts of apps remaining as landmarks, un-touched by obfuscation. For instance, some prior approaches have assumed that the structural relation- ships between identifiers (e.g. that A represents a class, and B represents a field declared directly in A) are not broken by obfuscators; others have assumed that control flow graphs maintain their structure (e.g. that no new basic blocks are added). Both approaches can be easily defeated by a motivated obfuscator. We present a new approach to deobfuscating Android apps that leverages deep learning and topic modeling on machine code, MACNETO. MACNETO makes few assumptions about the kinds of modifications that an obfuscator might perform, and we show that it has high precision when applied to two different state-of-the-art obfuscators: ProGuard and Allatori.

Kim                    2017-04-18                    Dynamic reconfiguration systems guided by coarse-grained program phases has found success in improving overall program performance and energy efficiency. These performance/energy savings are limited by the granularity that program phases are detected since phases that occur at a finer granularity goes undetected and reconfiguration opportunities are missed.  In this study, we detect program phases using interval sizes on the order of tens, hundreds, and thousands of program cycles. This is in stark contrast with prior phase detection studies where the interval size is on the order of several thousands to millions of cycles.  The primary goal of this study is to begin to fill a gap in the literature on phase detection by characterizing super fine-grained program phases and demonstrating an application where detection of these relatively short-lived phases can be instrumental. Traditional models for phase detection including basic block vectors and working set signatures are used to detect super fine-grained phases as well as a less traditional model based on microprocessor activity. Finally, we show an analytical case study where super fine-grained phases are applied to voltage and frequency scaling optimizations.

Unfortunately, there is little quantitative data on how well existing tools can detect these attacks. This paper presents the first quantitative study on concurrency attacks and their implications on tools. Our study on 10 widely used programs reveals 26 concurrency attacks with broad threats (e.g., OS privilege escalation), and we built scripts to successfully exploit 10 attacks. Our study further reveals that, only extremely small portions of inputs and thread interleavings (or schedules) can trigger these attacks, and existing concurrency bug detectors work poorly because they lack help to identify the vulnerable inputs and schedules. Our key insight is that the reports in existing detectors have implied moderate hints on what inputs and schedules will likely lead to attacks and what will not (e.g., benign bug reports). With this insight, this paper presents a new directed concurrency attack detection approach and its implementation, OWL. It extracts hints from the reports with static analysis, augments existing detectors by pruning out the benign inputs and schedules, and then directs detectors and its own runtime vulnerability verifiers to work on the remaining, likely vulnerable inputs and schedules. Evaluation shows that OWL reduced 94.3% reports caused by benign inputs or schedules and detected 7 known concurrency attacks. OWL also detected 3 previously unknown concurrency attacks, including a use-after-free attack in SSDB confirmed as CVE-2016-1000324, an integer overflow, HTML integrity violation in Apache and three new MySQL data races confirmed with bug ID 84064, 84122, 84241.

Bellovin                    2016-11-28                    It has long been known that George Fabyan's Riverbank Laboratories provided the U.S. military with cryptanalytic and training services during World War I. The relationship has always be seen as voluntary.  Newly discovered evidence raises the question of whether Fabyan was in fact paid, at least in part, for his services, but available records do not provide a definitive answer.

Bellovin                    2016-11-25                    New information has been discovered about Frank Miller's 1882 one-time pad.  These documents explain Miller's threat model and show that he had a reasonably deep understanding of the problem; they also suggest that his scheme was used more than had been supposed.

In this work, we present a novel-mechanism which allows debugging of production systems on-the-fly. We leverage user-space virtualization technology (OpenVZ/LXC), to launch replicas from running instances of a production application, thereby having two containers: prod uction (which provides the real output), and debug (for debugging). The debug container provides a sandbox environment for debugging without any perturbation to the production environment. Customized network-proxy agents asynchronously replicate and replay network inputs from clients to both the production and debug-container, as well as safely discard all network output from the debug-container. We evaluated this low-overhead record and replay technique on five real-world applications, finding that it was effective at reproducing real bugs. In comparison to existing monitoring solutions which can slow-down production applications, Kensa allows application monitoring at â€œzero-overheadâ€.

While most approaches focus on identifying code that looks alike, some techniques aim at detecting code that functions alike. Detecting these functional clones â€” code that functions alike â€” in object oriented languages remains an open question because of the difficulty in exposing and comparing programsâ€™ functionality effectively, in general cases undecidable. We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, which detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by identifying and mining their inputs and outputs. The key insight is to use existing workloads to execute programs and then measure functional similarities between programs based on their inputs and outputs. Further, to identify inputs and outputs of programs appropriately, we use the techniques of static and dynamic data flow analysis. These enhancements mitigate the problems in object oriented languages with respect to identifying program I/Os as reported by prior work. We implement such techniques in our system, HitoshiIO, which is open source and freely available. Our experimental results show that HitoshiIO detects âˆ¼ 900 and âˆ¼ 2, 000 functional clones by static and dynamic data flow analysis, respectively, across a corpus of 118 projects. In a random sample of the detected clones by the static data flow analysis, HitoshiIO achieves 68+% true positive rate with only 15% false positive rate.

We call this multi-mobile computing. However, the tremendous device, hardware, and software heterogeneity of mobile systems makes this difficult in practice. We present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing across heterogeneous mobile systems that enable new ways of sharing and combining multiple devices. M2 leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding and decoding hardware in mobile systems to define a client-server device stack that shares devices seamlessly across heterogeneous systems. M2 introduces device transformation, a new technique to mix and match heterogeneous input and output device data including rich media content. Example device transformations for transparently making existing unmodified apps multi-mobile include fused devices, which combine multiple devices into a more capable one, and translated devices, which can substitute use of one type of device for another. We have implemented an M2 prototype on Android that operates across heterogeneous hardware and software, including multiple versions of Android and iOS devices, the latter allowing iOS users to also run Android apps. Our results using unmodified apps from Google Play show that M2 can enable apps to be combined in new ways, and can run device-intensive apps across multiple mobile systems with modest overhead and qualitative performance indistinguishable from using local device hardware.

A Software Engineering Perspective on Game Bugs                                        Iris Zhang                    2016-06-01                    In the past decade, the complexity of video games have increased dramatically and so have the complexity of software systems behind them. The difficulty in designing and testing games invariably leads to bugs that manifest themselves across funny video reels on graphical glitches and millions of submitted support tickets. This paper presents an analysis of game developers and their teams who have knowingly released bugs to see what factors may motivate them in doing so. It examines different development environments as well as inquiring into varied types of game platforms and play-style. Above all, it seeks out how established research on software development best practices and challenges should inform understanding of these bugs. These findings may lead to targeted efforts to mitigate some of the factors leading to glitches, tailored to the specific needs of the game development team.

As a business owner and student, I implement many software principles daily in both my work and personal life. After experiencing the power of Agile methodologies outside the scope of software engineering, I always think about how I can integrate the computer science skills that I am learning at Columbia in my life. For my study, I seek to learn about other software engineering development processes that can be useful in life. I theorize that if a model such as Agile can provide me with useful tools, then a model that the government and most of the world trusts should have paradigms I can learn with as well. The software model I will study is open source software (OSS). My research examines the lateral software standards of (OSS) and closed source software (CSS). For the scope of this paper, I will focus on research primarily on Linux as the OSS model and Agile as the CSS model. OSS has had an extraordinary impact on the software revolution [1], and CSS models have gained such popularity that itâ€™s paradigms extend far beyond the software engineering space. Before delving into research, I thought the methodologies of OSS and CSS would be radically different. My study shall describe the similarities that exist between these two methodologies. In the process of my research, I was able to implement the values and paradigms that define the OSS development model to work more productively in my business. Software engineering core values and models can be used as a tool to improve our lives.

Their hybrid nature introduces new attack vectors but also provides an opportunity to design of new security architectures. In this work, we present YOLO,--- You Only Live Once --- a security architecture that leverages two unique physical properties of a CPS, inertia: the tendency of objects to stay at rest or in motion, and its built-in reliability to intermittent faults to survive CPS attacks. \r\rAt a high level, YOLO aims to use a new diversified variant for every new sensor input to the CPS'.  The delays involved in YOLO, viz., the delays for rebooting and diversification,  are easily absorbed by the CPS because of the inherent inertia and their ability to withstand minor perturbations.  We implement YOLO on an open source Car Engine Control Unit, and with measurements from a real race car engine show that YOLO is imminently practical.

While most approaches focus on identifying code that looks alike, some researchers propose to detect instead code that functions alike, which are known as functional clones. However, previous work has raised the technical challenges to detect these functional clones in object oriented languages such as Java. We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, a language-agnostic technique that detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by observing and mining inputs and outputs. We implemented this technique targeting programs that run on the JVM, creating HitoshiIO (available freely on GitHub), a tool to detect functional code clones. Our experimental results show that it is powerful in detecting these functional clones, finding 185 methods that are functionally similar across a corpus of 118 projects, even when there are only very few inputs available. In a random sample of the detected clones, HitoshiIO achieves 68+% true positive rate, while the false positive rate is only 15%.

Nayar                    2016-02-11                    Cambits is a set of physical blocks that can be used to build a wide variety of cam-eras with different functionalities. A unique feature of Cambits is that it is easy and quick to reconfigure. The blocks are assembled using magnets, without any screws or cables. When two blocks are attached, they are electrically connected by spring-loaded pins that carry power, data and control signals. With this novel architecture we can use Cambits to configure various imaging systems. The host computer al-ways knows the current configuration and presents the user with a menu of functionalities that the configuration can perform. We demonstrate a wide range of computational photography methods including HDR, wide angle, panoramic, collage, kaliedoscopic, post-focus, light field and stereo imaging. Cambits can even be used to configure a microscope. Cambits is a scalable system, allowing new blocks and accompanying software to be added to the existing set.

Many of these web applications are quite storage-intensive. Cloud computing offers attractive and economical choices for meeting their storage needs. Unfortunately, it remains challenging for developers to best leverage them to minimize cost. This paper presents Grandet, a storage system that greatly reduces storage cost for web applications deployed in the cloud. Grandet provides both a key-value interface and a file system interface, supporting a broad spectrum of web applications. Under the hood, it supports multiple heterogeneous stores, and unifies them by placing each data object at the store deemed most economical. We implemented Grandet on Amazon Web Services and evaluated Grandet on a diverse set of four popular open-source web applications. Our results show that Grandet reduces their cost by an average of 42.4%, and it is fast, scalable, and easy to use. The source code of Grandet is at http://columbia.github.io/grandet.

We present the first in-depth study of ARM virtualization performance on ARM server hardware, including measurements of two popular ARM and x86 hypervisors, KVM and Xen. We show how the ARM hardware support for virtualization can support much faster transitions between the VM and the hypervisor, a key hypervisor operation. However, current hypervisor designs, including both KVM (Type 1) and Xen (Type 2), are not able to lever- age this performance benefit in practice for real application workloads. We discuss the reasons why and show that other factors related to hypervisor software design and implementation have a larger role in overall performance than the speed of micro architectural operations. Based on our measurements, we discuss changes to ARMâ€™s hardware virtualization support that can potentially bridge the gap to bring its faster virtual machine exit mechanism to modern Type 2 hypervisors running real applications. These changes have been incorporated into the latest ARM architecture.

We measure the speed-up on a bubble oscillation test with varying mesh resolution. We also report a few examples with higher complexity than previously achieved.

Directly translating these structures yields infinitely large circuits; a subtler approach is required. We propose a sequence of abstraction-lowering transformations that exposes time and memory in a Haskell program. producing a simpler form for hardware translation. This paper outlines these transformations on a specific example; future research will focus on generalizing and automating them in our group's compiler.

Cyber-physical systems include systems ranging from critical infrastructure such as a power grid and transportation system to health and biomedical devices. System reliability, i.e., the ability of a system to perform its intended function under a given set of environmental and operational conditions for a given period of time, is a fundamental requirement of cyber-physical systems. An unreliable system often leads to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. An important and prevalent type of cyber-physical system meets the following criteria: processing large amounts of data; employing software as a system component; running online continuously; having operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and an accountability requirement for safety critical systems. This thesis aims to improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical system.\r\rTo improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical system, I present a system evaluation approach entitled automated online evaluation (AOE), which is a data-centric runtime monitoring and reliability evaluation approach that works in parallel with the cyber-physical system to conduct automated evaluation along the workflow of the system continuously using computational intelligence and self-tuning techniques and provide operator-in-the-loop feedback on reliability improvement. For example, abnormal input and output data at or between the multiple stages of the system can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop. The operator can then take actions and make changes to the system based on the alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and increased system reliability. One technique used by the approach is data quality analysis using computational intelligence, which applies computational intelligence in evaluating data quality in an automated and efficient way in order to make sure the running system perform reliably as expected. Another technique used by the approach is self-tuning which automatically self-manages and self-configures the evaluation system to ensure that it adapts itself based on the changes in the system and feedback from the operator. To implement the proposed approach, I further present a system architecture called autonomic reliability improvement system (ARIS).\r\rThis thesis investigates three hypotheses. First, I claim that the automated online evaluation empowered by data quality analysis using computational intelligence can effectively improve system reliability for cyber-physical systems in the domain of interest as indicated above. In order to prove this hypothesis, a prototype system needs to be developed and deployed in various cyber-physical systems while certain reliability metrics are required to measure the system reliability improvement quantitatively. Second, I claim that the self-tuning can effectively self-manage and self-configure the evaluation system based on the changes in the system and feedback from the operator-in-the-loop to improve system reliability. Third, I claim that the approach is effcient. It should not have a large impact on the overall system performance and introduce only minimal extra overhead to the cyberphysical system. Some performance metrics should be used to measure the effciency and added overhead quantitatively.\r\rAdditionally, in order to conduct efficient and cost-effective automated online evaluation for data-intensive CPS, which requires large volumes of data and devotes much of its processing time to I/O and data manipulation, this thesis presents COBRA, a cloud-based reliability assurance framework. COBRA provides automated multi-stage runtime reliability evaluation along the CPS workflow using data relocation services, a cloud data store, data quality analysis and process scheduling with self-tuning to achieve scalability, elasticity and efficiency.\r\rFinally, in order to provide a generic way to compare and benchmark system reliability for CPS and to extend the approach described above, this thesis presents FARE, a reliability benchmark framework that employs a CPS reliability model, a set of methods and metrics on evaluation environment selection, failure analysis, and reliability estimation.\r\rThe main contributions of this thesis include validation of the above hypotheses and empirical studies of ARIS automated online evaluation system, COBRA cloud-based reliability assurance framework for data-intensive CPS, and FARE framework for benchmarking reliability of cyber-physical systems. This work has advanced the state of the art in the CPS reliability research, expanded the body of knowledge in this field, and provided some useful studies for further research.

In some formulations of the problem, concentration inequalities (such as Hoeffdingâ€™s inequality) are used to estimate the confidence interval for an approximated aggregated value. Samples are usually chosen until the confidence interval is arbitrarily small enough regardless of how the approximated query answers will be used (for example, in interactive visualizations). In this report, we show how to exploit visualization-specific properties to reduce the sampling complexity of a sampling-based approximate query processing algorithm while preserving certain visualization guarantees (the visual property of relative ordering) with a very high probability.

Current tools can help detect code with statically similar syntactic features (code clones). Unfortunately, some code fragments that behave alike without similar syntax may be missed. In this paper, we propose the term â€œcode relativesâ€ to refer to code with dynamically similar execution features. Code relatives can be used for such tasks as implementation-agnostic code search and classification of code with similar behavior for human understanding, which code clone detection cannot achieve. To detect code relatives, we present DyCLINK, which constructs an approximate runtime representation of code using a dynamic instruction graph. With our link analysis based subgraph matching algorithm, DyCLINK detects fine-grained code relatives efficiently. In our experiments, DyCLINK analyzed 290+ million prospective subgraph matches. The results show that DyCLINK detects not only code relatives, but also code clones that the state-of-the-art system is unable to identify. In a code classification problem, DyCLINK achieved 96% precision on average compared with the competitorâ€™s 61%.

Phosphor is the first portable, accurate and performant dynamic taint tracking system for Java. While previous systems for performing general-purpose taint tracking in the JVM required specialized research JVMs, Phosphor works with standard off-the-shelf JVMs (such as Oracle's HotSpot and OpenJDK's IcedTea). Phosphor also differs from previous portable JVM taint tracking systems that were not general purpose (e.g. tracked only tags on Strings and no other type), in that it tracks tags on all variables. We have also made several enhancements to Phosphor, allowing it to track taint tags through control flow (in addition to data flow), as well as allowing it to track an arbitrary number of relationships between taint tags (rather than be limited to only 32 tags). In this demonstration, we show how developers writing testing tools can benefit from Phosphor, and explain briefly how to interact with it.

Kim, Stephen A. Edwards                    2015-04-01                    Abstraction in hardware description languages stalled at the\rregister-transfer level decades ago, yet few alternatives have had\rmuch success, in part because they provide only modest gains in\rexpressivity.  We propose to make a much larger jump: a compiler that\rsynthesizes hardware from behavioral functional specifications. Our\rcompiler translates general Haskell programs into a restricted\rintermediate representation before applying a series of\rsemantics-preserving transformations, concluding with a simple\rsyntax-directed translation to SystemVerilog.  Here, we present the\roverall framework for this compiler, focusing on the IRs involved and\rour method for translating general recursive functions into equivalent\rhardware. We conclude with experimental results that depict the\rperformance and resource usage of the circuitry generated with our\rcompiler.

We present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing by enabling remote sharing and combining of devices across multiple mobile systems. M2 leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding and decoding hardware in mobile systems to define a cross-platform interface for remote device sharing to operate seamlessly across heterogeneous mobile hardware and software. M2 can be used to build new multi-mobile apps as well as make existing unmodified apps multi-mobile aware through the use of fused devices, which transparently combine multiple devices into a more capable one. We have implemented an M2 prototype on Android that operates across heterogeneous hardware and software, including using Android and iOS remote devices, the latter allowing iOS users to also run Android apps. Our results using unmodified apps from Google Play show that M2 can enable even display-intensive 2D and 3D games to use remote devices across multiple mobile systems with modest overhead and qualitative performance indistinguishable from using local device hardware.

Because these programs have no general oracle to identify their correctness, traditional testing techniques such as unit testing may not be helpful for developers to detect potential bugs. This paper presents a novel system, KABU, which can dynamically infer properties that describe the characteristics of a program before and after transforming its input at the method level. Metamorphic Properties (MPs) are pivotal to detecting potential bugs in programs without test oracles, but most previous work relies solely on human effort do identify them. This paper also proposes a new testing concept, Metamorphic Differential Testing (MDT). By comparing the MPs between different versions of the same application, KABU can detect potential bugs in the program. We have performed a preliminary evaluation of KABU by comparing the MPs detected by humans with the MPs detected by KABU. Our preliminary results are very promising: KABU can find more MPs as human developers, and its differential testing mechanism is effective at detecting function changes in programs.

DisCo enables displays and cameras to communicate with each other, while also displaying and capturing images for human consumption. Messages are transmitted by temporally modulating the display brightness at high frequencies so that they are imperceptible to humans. Messages are received by a rolling shutter camera which converts the temporally modulated incident light into a spatial flicker pattern. In the captured image, the flicker pattern is superimposed on the pattern shown on the display. The flicker and the display pattern are separated by capturing two images with different exposures. The proposed system performs robustly in challenging real-world situations such as occlusion, variable display size, defocus blur, perspective distortion and camera rotation. Unlike several existing visible light communication methods, DisCo works with off-the-shelf image sensors. It is compatible with a variety of sources (including displays, single LEDs), as well as reflective surfaces illuminated with light sources. We have built hardware prototypes that demonstrate DisCoâ€™s performance in several scenarios. Because of its robustness, speed, ease of use and generality, DisCo can be widely deployed in several CHI applications, such as advertising, pairing of displays with cell-phones, tagging objects in stores and museums, and indoor navigation.

However, they are also challenging for developers and tools to verify because of the huge number of possible interleavings that result from fine-grained synchronizations.\r\rThis paper address this fundamental problem between performance and verifiability of lock-free data structures. We present TXIT, a system that greatly reduces the set of possible interleavings by inserting transactions into the implementation of a lock-free data structure. We leverage hardware transactional memory support from Intel Haswell processors to enforce these artificial transactions. Evaluation on six popular lock-free data structures shows that TXIT makes it easy to verify lock-free data structures while incurring acceptable runtime overhead. Further analysis shows that two inefficiencies in Haswell are the largest contributors to this overhead.

Many machine-learning applications for â€œbig dataâ€, bioinformatics and cyberphysical systems fall in this scope: they do not have a test oracle. Metamorphic Testing, a simple testing technique that does not require a test oracle, has been shown to be effective for testing such applications. We present Metamorphic Runtime Checking, a novel approach that conducts metamorphic testing of both the entire application and individual functions during a programâ€™s execution. We have applied Metamorphic Runtime Checking to 9 machine-learning applications, finding it to be on average 170% more effective than traditional metamorphic testing at only the full application level.

It is built upon the QEMU whole system emulator, and so analyses have access to all code executing in the guest and all data. PANDA adds the ability to record and replay executions, enabling iterative, deep, whole system analyses. Further, the replay log files are compact and shareable, allowing for repeatable experiments. A nine billion instruction boot of FreeBSD, e.g., is represented by only a few hundred MB. Further, PANDA leverages QEMU's support of thirteen different CPU architectures to make analyses of those diverse instruction sets possible within the LLVM IR. In this way, PANDA can have a single dynamic taint analysis, for example, that precisely supports many CPUs. PANDA analyses are written in a simple plugin architecture which includes a mechanism to share functionality between plugins, increasing analysis code re-use and simplifying complex analysis development. We demonstrate PANDA's effectiveness via a number of use cases, including enabling an old but legitimate version of Starcraft to run despite a lost CD key, in-depth diagnosis of an Internet Explorer crash, and uncovering the censorship activities and mechanisms of a Chinese IM client.

These dependencies may manifest between several test cases, or simply within a single test case. When it's left to developers to document, understand, and respond to these dependencies, a mistake can result in unexpected and invalid test results. Although current testing infrastructure does not currently leverage state dependency information, we argue that it could, and that by doing so testing can be improved. Our results thus far show that by recovering dependencies between test cases and modifying the popular testing framework, JUnit, to utilize this information, we can optimize the testing process, reducing time needed to run tests by 62% on average. Our ongoing work is to apply similar analyses to improve existing state of the art test suite prioritization techniques and state of the art test case generation techniques.

Due to global illumination, the temporally varying radiance received at the sensor is a combination of light received along multiple paths. Recovering scene properties (e.g., scene depths) from the received radiance requires separating these contributions, which is challenging due to the complexity of global illumination and the additional temporal dimension of the radiance.\r\rWe propose phasor imaging, a framework for performing fast inverse light transport analysis using C-ToF sensors. Phasor imaging is based on the idea that by representing light transport quantities as phasors and light transport events as phasor transformations, light transport analysis can be simplified in the temporal frequency domain. We study the effect of temporal illumination frequencies on light transport, and show that for a broad range of scenes, global radiance (multi-path interference) vanishes for frequencies higher than a scene-dependent threshold. We use this observation for developing two novel scene recovery techniques. First, we present Micro ToF imaging, a ToF based shape recovery technique that is robust to errors due to global illumination. Second, we present a technique for separating the direct  and global components of radiance. Both techniques require capturing as few as 3-4 images and minimal computations. We demonstrate the validity of the presented techniques via simulations and experiments performed with our hardware prototype.

The trick is especially useful for solving Lagrangian saddle point problems when minimizing quadratic energies subject to linear equality constraints [Gill et al. 1987]. Typically, to apply the trick, the energyâ€™s Hessian is assumed positive definite. I generalize this technique for positive semi-definite Hessians.

Stolfo                    2014-06-02                    Cloud computing offers a scalable, low-cost, and resilient platform for critical applications. Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is a variant of this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead of content inspection and the dynamic routing of content paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels of content privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure.

Bellovin                    2014-05-13                    The conventional narrative for the invention of the AT&T\rone-time pad was related by David Kahn.  Based on the evidence available\rin the AT&T patent files and from interviews and correspondence,\rhe concluded that  Gilbert Vernam came up with the need for randomness, while\rJoseph Mauborgne realized the need for a non-repeating key.  Examination\rof other documents\rsuggests a different narrative.\rIt is most likely that Vernam came up with the need for non-repetition;\rMauborgne, though, apparently contributed materially to the\rinvention of the\rtwo-tape variant.  Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that\rhe suggested the need for randomness to Vernam.\rHowever, neither Mauborgne, Herbert Yardley, nor\ranyone at AT&T really understood\rthe security advantages of the true one-time tape.  Col. Parker Hitt\rmay have; William Friedman definitely did.  Finally, we\rshow that Friedman's attacks on the two-tape variant\rlikely led to his invention of the index of coincidence, arguably\rthe single most important publication in the history of \rcryptanalysis.

This thesis will consist of the following four projects that aim to address the issues of privacy and software engineering.\r\rFirst, only a little is known about how users and developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate their privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements, we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 408 valid responses. Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more concerned about the content of their documents and their personal data such as location than about their interaction data. Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective. We also observed interesting differences between people from different geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific and Europe believe that content and metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America. Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal, technical, and commercial perspectives.\r\rSecond, a related challenge to above, is to make privacy more understandable in complex systems that may have a variety of user interface options, which may change often. As social network platforms have evolved, the ability for users to control how and with whom information is being shared introduces challenges concerning the configuration and comprehension of privacy settings. To address these concerns, our crowd sourced approach simplifies the understanding of privacy settings by using data collected from 512 users over a 17 month period to generate visualizations that allow users to compare their personal settings to an arbitrary subset of individuals of their choosing. To validate our approach we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 59 valid responses after which we conducted follow-up interviews with 10 respondents. Our results showed that 70% of respondents found visualizations using crowd sourced data useful for understanding privacy settings, and 80% preferred a crowd sourced tool for configuring their privacy settings over current privacy controls.\r\rThird, as software evolves over time, this might introduce bugs that breach usersâ€™ privacy. Further, there might be system-wide policy changes that could change usersâ€™ settings to be more or less private than before. We present a novel technique that can be used by end-users for detecting changes in privacy, i.e., regression testing for privacy. Using a social approach for detecting privacy bugs, we present two prototype tools. Our evaluation shows the feasibility and utility of our approach for detecting privacy bugs. We highlight two interesting case studies on the bugs that were discovered using our tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages regression testing for detecting privacy bugs from an end-user perspective.\r\rFourth, approaches to addressing these privacy concerns typically require substantial extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where privacy is concerned, but may have significant negative impact with respect to Green Computing and sustainability, another major societal concern. Spending more computation time results in spending more energy and other resources that make the software system less sustainable. Ideally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable â€” systems where privacy could be achieved â€œfor free,â€ i.e., without having to spend extra computational effort. We describe how privacy can indeed be achieved for free â€” an accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation â€” in web applications and online systems that have access to user data. We show the feasibility, sustainability, and utility of our approach and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.\r\rFinally, we generalize the problem of privacy and its tradeoffs. As Social Computing has increasingly captivated the general public, it has become a popular research area for computer scientists. Social Computing research focuses on online social behavior and using artifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other useful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy, which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues. We highlight some of the relevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal Computing. We feel that these topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence as they will provide useful avenues of research leading to increasing benefits for society as a whole.

Under mesh refinement, approximately first order convergence or higher in L1 and L2 is shown for vertex positions, face normals and non-manifold junction curves in a number of scenarios involving the new operations proposed in the method.

Kim                    2014-04-08                    This paper introduces energy exchanges, a set of abstractions that allow applications to help hardware and operating systems manage power and energy consumption. Using annotations, energy exchanges dictate when, where, and how to trade performance or accuracy for power in ways that only an applicationâ€™s developer can decide. In particular, the abstractions offer audits and budgets which watch and cap the power or energy of some piece of the application. The interface also exposes energy and power usage reports which an application may use to change its behavior. Such information complements existing system-wide energy management by operating systems or hardware, which provide global fairness and protections, but are unaware of the internal dynamics of an application.\r\rEnergy exchanges are implemented as a user-level C++ library. The library employs an accounting technique to attribute  shares of system-wide energy consumption (provided by system-wide hardware energy meters available on newer hardware platforms) to individual application threads. With these per-thread meters and careful tracking of an applicationâ€™s activity, the library exposes energy and power usage for program regions of interest via the energy exchange abstractions with negligible runtime or power overhead. We use the library to demonstrate three applications of energy exchanges: (1) the prioritization of a mobile gameâ€™s energy use over third-party advertisements, (2) dynamic adaptations of the framerate of a video tracking benchmark that maximize performance and accuracy within the confines of a given energy allotment, and (3) the triggering of computational sprints and corresponding cooldowns, based on time, system TDP, and power consumption.

Taint tracking allows for analysis of application data flow by assigning labels to inputs, and then propagating those labels through data flow. Taint tracking systems traditionally compromise among performance, precision, accuracy, and portability. Performance can be critical, as these systems are typically intended to be deployed with software, and hence must have low overhead. To be deployed in security-conscious settings, taint tracking must also be accurate and precise.\rDynamic taint tracking must be portable in order to be easily deployed and adopted for real world purposes, without requiring recompilation of the operating system or language interpreter, and without requiring access to application source code.\r\rWe present Phosphor, a dynamic taint tracking system for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that simultaneously achieves our goals of performance, accuracy, precision, and portability. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first portable general purpose taint tracking system for the JVM. We evaluated Phosphor's performance on two commonly used JVM languages (Java and Scala), on two versions of two commonly used JVMs (Oracle's HotSpot and OpenJDK's IcedTea) and on Android's Dalvik Virtual Machine, finding its performance to be impressive: as low as 3% (53% on average), using the DaCapo macro benchmark suite. This paper describes the approach that Phosphor uses to achieve portable taint tracking in the JVM.

Characteristic examples of this trend are Windows on x86 and Android on ARM.\rThis homogeneity, sometimes referred to as â€œcomputing oligoculture\", provides a fertile ground for malware\rin the highly networked world of today.\rOne way to counter this problem is to diversify systems so that attackers cannot quickly and easily\rcompromise a large number of machines. For instance, if each system has a different ISA, the attacker\rhas to invest more time in developing exploits that run on every system manifestation. It is not that each\rindividual attack gets harder, but the spread of malware slows down. Further, if the diversified ISA is kept\rsecret from the attacker, the bar for exploitation is raised even higher.\rIn this paper, we show that system diversification can be realized by enabling diversity at the lowest\rhardware/software interface, the ISA, with almost zero performance overhead. We also describe how prac-\rtical development and deployment problems of diversified systems can be handled easily in the context of\rpopular software distrbution models, such as the mobile app store model. We demonstrate our proposal with\ran OpenSPARC FPGA prototype                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Teaching Microarchitecture through Metaphors                                        Julianna Eum, Simha Sethumadhavan                    2014-03-19                    Students traditionally learn microarchitecture by studying textual\r\rdescriptions with diagrams but few analogies. Several popular \r\rtextbooks on this topic introduce concepts such as pipelining and \r\rcaching in the context of simple paper-only architectures. While \r\rthis instructional style allows important concepts to be covered \r\rwithin a given class period, students have difficulty bridging the \r\rgap between what is covered in classes and real-world \r\rimplementations. Discussing concrete implementations and \r\rcomplications would, however, take too much time. \r\rIn this paper, we propose a technique of representing \r\rmicroarchitecture building blocks with animated metaphors to \r\raccelerate the process of learning about complex \r\rmicroarchitectures. We represent hardware implementations as \r\rroad networks that include specific patterns of traffic flow found \r\rin microarchitectural behavior. Our experiences indicate an 83% \r\rimprovement to understanding memory system microarchitecture. \r\rWe believe the mental models developed by these students will\r\rserve them in remembering microarchitectural behavior and \r\rextend to learning new microarchitectures more easily.

Evaluations of such tools against benchmarks and academic attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test FANCI's abilities to efficiently detect malicious backdoor circuits within hardware designs.\r\rIn the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups\rfrom multiple continents created designs with malicious backdoors hidden\rin them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these\rbackdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red\rteam was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are backdoors that are not made stealthy, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some aspects of the FANCI prototype that make analysis time-consuming in some cases, which motivates further development of the prototype in the future.

These detectors belong to a class of detectors known as signature-based detectors as they catch malware by comparing a program's execution pattern (signature) to execution patterns of known malware programs.  In this work, we propose a new class of detectors - anomaly-based hardware malware detectors - that do not require signatures for malware detection, and thus can catch a wider range of malware including potentially novel ones. We use unsupervised machine learning to build profiles of normal program execution based on data from performance counters, and use these profiles to detect significant deviations in program behavior that occur as a result of malware exploitation. We show that real-world exploitation of popular programs such as IE and Adobe PDF Reader on a Windows/x86 platform can be detected with nearly perfect certainty. We also examine the limits and challenges in implementing this approach in face of a sophisticated adversary attempting to evade anomaly-based detection. The proposed detector is complementary to previously proposed signature-based detectors and can be used together to improve security.

For the ever-demanding cellphone users, the exhaustive list of features that a smartphone supports just keeps getting more exhaustive with time. These features aid oneâ€™s personal and professional uses as well. Extrapolating into the future the features of a present-day smartphone, the lives of us humans using smartphones are going to be unimaginably agile.\r\rWith the above said emphasis on the current and future potential of a smartphone, the ability to virtualize smartphones with all their real-world features into a virtual platform, is a boon for those who want to rigorously experiment and customize the virtualized smartphone hardware without spending an extra penny. Once virtualizable independently on a larger scale, the idea of virtualized smartphones with all the virtualized pieces of hardware takes an interesting turn with the sensors being virtualized in a way thatâ€™s closer to the real-world behavior.\r\rWhen accessible remotely with the real-time responsiveness, the above mentioned real-world behavior will be a real dealmaker in many real-world systems, namely, the life-saving systems like the ones that instantaneously get alerts about harmful magnetic radiations in the deep mining areas, etc. And these life-saving systems would be installed on a large scale on the desktops or large servers as virtualized smartphones having the added support of virtualized sensors which remotely fetch the real hardware sensor readings from a real smartphone in real-time. Based on these readings the lives working in the affected areas can be alerted and thus saved by the people who are operating the at the desktops or large servers hosting the virtualized smartphones.\r\rIn addition, the direct and one of the biggest advantages of such a real hardware sensor driven Sensor Emulation in an emulated Android(-x86) environment is that the Android applications that use sensors can now run on the emulator and act under the\rinfluence of real hardware sensorsâ€™ due to the emulated sensors. The current work of Sensor Emulation is quite unique when compared to the existing and past sensor-related works. The uniqueness comes from the full-fledged sensoremulation in a virtualized smartphone environment as opposed to building some sophisticated physical systems that usually aggregate the sensor readings from the real hardware sensors, might be in a remote manner and in real-time. For example, wireless sensor networks based remote-sensing systems that install real hardware sensors in remote places and have the sensor readings from all those sensors at a centralized server or something similar, for the necessary real-time or offline analysis. In these systems, apart from collecting mere real hardware sensor readings into a centralized entity, nothing more is being achieved unlike in the current work of Sensor Emulation wherein the emulated sensors behave exactly like the remote real hardware sensors. The emulated sensors can be calibrated, speeded up or slowed down(in terms of their sampling frequency), influence the sensor-based application running inside the virtualized smartphone environment exactly as the real hardware sensors of a real phone would do to the sensor-based application running in that real phone. In essence, the current work is more about generalizing the sensors with all its real-world characteristics as far as possible in a virtualized platform than just a\rframework to send and receive sensor readings over the network between the real and virtual phones.\r\rRealizing the useful advantages of Sensor Emulation which is about adding virtualized sensors support to emulated environments, the current work emulates a total of ten sensors present in the real smartphone, Samsung Nexus S, an Android device. Virtual phones run Android-x86 while real phones run Android. The real reason behind choosing Android-x86 for virtual phone is that x86-based Android\rdevices are feature-rich over ARM based ones, for example a full-fledged x86 desktop or a tablet has more features than a relatively small smartphone. Out of the ten, five are real sensors and the rest are virtual or synthetic ones. The real ones are Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Light, Proximity, and Gyroscope whereas the virtual ones are Corrected Gyroscope, Linear Acceleration, Gravity, Orientation, and Rotation Vector. The emulated Android-x86 is of Android release version Jelly Bean 4.3.1 which differs only very slightly in terms of bug fixes from Android Jelly Bean 4.3 running on the real smartphone.\r\rOne of the noteworthy aspects of the Sensor Emulation accomplished is being demand-less - exactly the same sensor-based Android applications will be able to use the sensors on the real and virtual phones, with absolutely no difference in terms of their sensor-based behavior.\r\rThe emulationâ€™s core idea is the socket-communication between two modules of Hardware Abstraction Layer(HAL) which is driver-agnostic, remotely over a wireless network in real-time. Apart from a Paired real-device scenario from which the real hardware sensor readings are fetched, the Sensor Emulation also is compatible with a Remote Server Scenario wherein the artificially generated sensor readings are fetched from a remote server. Due to the Sensor Emulation having been built on mereend-to-end socket-communication, itâ€™s logical and obvious to see that the real and virtual phones can run different Android(-x86) releases with no real impact on the\rSensor Emulation being accomplished.\r\rSensor Emulation once completed was evaluated for each of the emulated sensors using applications from Android Market as well as Amazon Appstore. The applications category include both the basic sensor-test applications that show raw sensor readings, as well as the advanced 3D sensor-driven games which are emulator compatible, especially in terms of the graphics. The evaluations proved the current work of Sensor Emulation to be generic, efficient, robust, fast, accurate, and real.\r\rAs of this writing i.e., January 2014, the current work of Sensor Emulation is the sole system-level sensor virtualization work that embraces remoteness in real-time for the emulated Android-x86 systems. It is important to note that though the current work is\rtargeted for Android-x86, the code written for the current work makes no assumptions about underlying platform to be an x86 one. Hence, the work is also logically seen as compatible with ARM based emulated Android environment though not actually tested.

Our analysis is conducted on different mobile devices (iOS and Android) over various wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE) under dynamic network conditions. Our measurements show that the video players frequently discard a large amount of video content although it is successfully delivered to a client.\r\rWe first investigate the root cause of this unwanted behavior. Then, we propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware video streaming architecture in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to reduce the waste of network resource and improve user experience. The architecture includes a selective packet discarding mechanism, which can be placed in packet data network gateways (P-GW). In addition, our QoS-aware rules assist video players in selecting an appropriate resolution under a fluctuating channel condition. We monitor network condition and configure QoS parameters to control availability of the maximum bandwidth in real time. In our experimental setup, the proposed platform shows up to 20.58% improvement in saving downlink bandwidth and improves user experience by reducing buffer underflow period to an average of 32 seconds.

We conduct a detailed study of the YouTube Content Delivery Network (CDN) on PCs and mobile devices over Wi-Fi and 3G networks under varying network conditions. We proved that a location-aware video server selection algorithm assigns a video content server\rbased on the network attachment point of a client. We found out that such distance-based algorithms carry the risk of directing a client to a less optimal content server, although there may exist other better performing video delivery servers. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use dynamic network information such as packet loss rates and Round Trip Time (RTT)between an edge node of an wireless network (e.g., an Internet Service Provider (ISP) router in a Wi-Fi network and a Radio\rNetwork Controller (RNC) node in a 3G network) and video content servers, to find the optimal video content server when a video is requested. Our empirical study shows that the proposed architecture can provide higher TCP performance, leading to better viewing quality compared to location-based video server selection algorithms.

However, it may converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to return an $\\eps$-approximation to the global minimum of $\\F$ in polynomial time provided the maximum degree $\\Delta=O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of $\\F$, which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating $\\log$ of the Bethe partition function, $\\log Z_B=-\\min \\F$, for a general model to additive $\\epsilon$-accuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem.  We explore an application to predicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the Bethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge.

A lot of studentsâ€™ mental model when they start learning programming is that â€œif it compiles and runs without crashing, it must work fine.â€ Thus exposure to testing, even at a very basic level, can be very beneficial to the students. In the short term, they will do better on their assignments as testing before submission might help them discover bugs in their implementation that they hadnâ€™t realized. In the long term, they will appreciate the importance of testing as part of the software development life cycle.

Users are consuming Internet services from multiple devices that have multiple network interfaces such as Wi-Fi, LTE, Bluetooth, and possibly wired LAN. Such diverse network connectivity can be used to increase both reliability and performance by running applications over multiple links, sequentially for seamless user experience, or in parallel for bandwidth and performance enhancements. The existing networking stack, however, offers almost no support for intelligently exploiting such network, device, and location diversity.\r\rIn this work, we survey recently proposed protocols and architectures that enable heterogeneous networking support. Upon evaluation, we abstract common design patterns and propose a unified networking architecture that makes better use of a heterogeneous dynamic environment, both in terms of networks and devices. The architecture enables mobile nodes to make intelligent decisions about how and when to use each or a combination of networks, based on access policies. With this new architecture, we envision a shift from current applications, which support a single network, location, and device at a time to applications that can support multiple networks, multiple locations, and multiple devices.

This paper discusses\rsynthesizing such logic from the functional language Haskell.  The\rproposed approach, which consists of rewriting steps that ultimately\rdismantle the source program into a simple dialect that enables a\rsyntax-directed translation to hardware, enables aggressive\rparallelization and the synthesis of application-specific distributed\rmemory systems.

However, as these platforms have evolved, the ability for users to control how and with whom information is being shared introduces challenges concerning the configuration and comprehension of privacy settings. To address these concerns, our crowd sourced approach simplifies the understanding of privacy settings by using data collected from 512 users over a 17 month period to generate visualizations that allow users to compare their personal settings to an arbitrary subset of individuals of their choosing. To validate our approach we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 50 valid responses after which we conducted follow-up interviews with 10 respondents. Our results showed that 80% of users found visualizations using crowd sourced data useful for understanding privacy settings, and 70% preferred a crowd sourced tool for configuring their privacy settings over current privacy controls.

However, only a little is known about how users and\rdevelopers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements,\rwe conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and\rcollected 408 valid responses.\rOur results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with\rdata sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more\rconcerned about the content of their documents and personal data such as location than\rtheir interaction data.\rUnlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data\ranonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective.\rWe also observed interesting differences between people from different\rgeographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about\rdata breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific\rand Europe believe that content and\rmetadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America.\rOur results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework\rthat is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal,\rtechnical, and commercial perspectives.

To address this problem, researchers have investigated techniques such as Test Suite Minimization. Test Suite Minimization reduces the number of tests in a suite by removing tests that appear redundant, at the risk of a reduction in fault-finding ability since it can be difficult to identify which tests are truly redundant. We take a completely different approach to solving the same problem of long running test suites by instead reducing the time needed to execute each test, an approach that we call Unit Test Virtualization. With Unit Test Virtualization, we reduce the overhead of isolating each unit test with a lightweight virtualization container. We describe the empirical analysis that grounds our approach and provide an implementation of Unit Test Virtualization targeting Java applications. We evaluated our implementation, VMVM, using 20 real-world Java applications and found that it reduces test suite execution time by up to 97% (on average, 62%) when compared to traditional unit test execution. We also compared VMVM to a well known Test Suite Minimization technique, finding the reduction provided by VMVM to be four times greater, while still executing every test with no loss of fault-finding ability.

Metamorphic testing, introduced by Chen et al., has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in testing these types of applications: test inputs are transformed in such a way that it is possible to predict the expected change to the output, and if the output resulting from this transformation is not as expected, then a fault must exist.\r\rHere, we improve upon previous work by presenting a new technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, which automatically conducts metamorphic testing of both the entire application and individual functions during a program's execution. This new approach improves the scope, scale, and sensitivity of metamorphic testing by allowing for the identification of more properties and execution of more tests, and increasing the likelihood of detecting faults not found by application-level properties. We also present the results of new mutation analysis studies that demonstrate that Metamorphic Runtime Checking can kill an average of 170% more mutants than traditional, application-level metamorphic testing alone, and advances the state of the art in testing applications without oracles.

Sheth                    2013-07-31                    We study the ability of students in a senior/graduate software engineering course to understand and\rapply metamorphic testing, a relatively recently invented advance in software testing research that\rcomplements conventional approaches such as equivalence partitioning and boundary analysis. We\rpreviously reported our investigation of the fall 2011 offering of the Columbia University course COMS\rW4156 Advanced Software Engineering, and here report on the fall 2012 offering and contrast it to\rthe previous year. Our main findings are: 1) Although the students in the second offering did not do\rvery well on the newly added individual assignment specifically focused on metamorphic testing,\rthereafter they were better able to find metamorphic properties for their team projects than the\rstudents from the previous year who did not have that preliminary homework and, perhaps most\rsignificantly, did not have the solution set for that homework. 2) Students in the second offering did\rreasonably well using the relatively novel metamorphic testing technique vs. traditional black box\rtesting techniques in their projects (such comparison data is not available for the first offering). 3)\rFinally, in both semesters, the majority of the student teams were able to apply metamorphic testing to\rtheir team projects after only minimal instruction, which would imply that metamorphic testing is a\rviable strategy for student testers.

Keromytis                    2013-07-18                    Low-latency anonymous communication networks, such as Tor, are geared towards web browsing, instant messaging, and other semi-interactive\rapplications. To achieve acceptable quality of service, these systems\rattempt to preserve packet inter-arrival characteristics, such as inter-packet delay. Consequently, a powerful adversary can mount traffic analysis attacks by observing similar traffic patterns at various points of the network, linking together otherwise unrelated network connections. Previous research has shown that having access to\ra few Internet exchange points is enough for monitoring a significant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers.\rAlthough the capacity of current networks makes packet-level monitoring at such a scale quite challenging, adversaries could potentially use less accurate but readily available traffic monitoring functionality, such as Cisco's NetFlow, to mount large-scale traffic analysis attacks.\r\rIn this paper, we assess the feasibility and effectiveness of practical\rtraffic analysis attacks against the Tor network using NetFlow data.\rWe present an active traffic analysis method based on deliberately\rperturbing the characteristics of user traffic at the server side,\rand observing a similar perturbation at the client side through\rstatistical correlation. We evaluate the accuracy of our method using both in-lab testing, as well as data gathered from a public Tor relay serving hundreds of users. Our method revealed the actual sources of anonymous traffic with 100% accuracy for the in-lab tests,\rand achieved an overall accuracy of about 81.4% for the real-world experiments, with an average false positive rate of 6.4%.

According to recent reports, mobile video streaming traffic accounted for 52.8% of total mobile data traffic in 2011, and it is forecast to reach 66.4% in 2015. We analyzed the network traffic behaviors of the two most popular HTTP-based video streaming services: YouTube and Netflix. Our research indicates that the network traffic behavior depends on factors such as the type of device, multimedia applications in use and network conditions. Furthermore, we found that a large part of the downloaded\rvideo content can be unaccepted by a video player even though it is successfully delivered to a client. This unwanted behavior often occurs when the video player changes the resolution in a fluctuating network condition and the playout buffer is full while downloading a video. Some of the measurements show that the discarded data may exceed 35% of the total video content.

Can these optimizations open up security vulnerabilities? In this invited talk at the Energy Secure System Architectures Workshop (run by Pradip Bose from IBM Watson research center) I discussed security implications of energy optimizations, capabilities of attackers, ease of exploitation, and potential payoff to the attacker. I presented a mini tutorial on security for computer architects, and a personal research wish list for this emerging topic.

Schlieren imaging systems provide a powerful technique to visualize changes or nonuniformities in refractive index of air or other transparent media. With the popularization of computational imaging techniques and widespread availability of digital imaging systems, schlieren systems provide novel methods of viewing transparent fluid dynamics. This paper presents a historical background of the technique, describes the methodology behind the system, presents a mathematical proof of schlieren fundamentals, and lists various recent applications and advancements in schlieren studies.

In addition, non-WiFi devices sharing the same spectrum with 802.11 networks such as microwave ovens, cordless phones, and baby monitors severely interfere with WiFi networks. Although the problem sources can be easily removed in many cases, it is difficult for end users to identify the root cause. \r\rWe introduce WiSlow, a software tool that diagnoses the root causes of poor WiFi performance with user-level network probes and leverages peer collaboration to identify the location of the causes. We elaborate on two main methods: packet loss analysis and 802.11 ACK pattern analysis.

This paper presents a smart gateway platform that connects everyday objects such as lights, thermometers, and TVs over the Internet. The proposed hardware architecture is implemented on an Arduino platform with a variety of off the shelf home automation technologies such as Zigbee and X10. Using the microcontroller-based platform, the SECE (Sense Everything, Control Everything) system allows users to create various IoT services such as monitoring sensors, controlling actuators, triggering action events, and periodic sensor reporting. We give an overview of the Arduino-based smart gateway architecture and its integration into SECE.

We present Chameleon, a multi-persona binary compatibility architecture that allows mobile device users to run applications built for different mobile ecosystems together on the same smartphone or tablet. Chameleon enhances the domestic operating system of a device with personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign operating system to run unmodified foreign binary applications. To accomplish this without reimplementing the entire foreign operating system from scratch, Chameleon provides four key mechanisms. First, a multi-persona binary interface is used that can load and execute both domestic and foreign applications that use different sets of system calls. Second, compile-time code adaptation makes it simple to reuse existing unmodified foreign kernel code in the domestic kernel. Third, API interposition and passport system calls make it possible to reuse foreign user code together with domestic kernel facilities to support foreign kernel functionality in user space. Fourth, schizophrenic processes allow foreign applications to use domestic libraries to access proprietary software and hardware interfaces on the device. We have built a Chameleon prototype and demonstrate that it imposes only modest performance overhead and can run iOS applications from the Apple App Store together with Android applications from Google Play on a Nexus 7 tablet running the latest version of Android.

We present our experiences building the Linux ARM hypervisor, KVM/ARM,\rthe first full system ARM virtualization solution that can run unmodified guest\roperating systems on ARM multicore hardware.  KVM/ARM introduces split-mode\rvirtualization, allowing a hypervisor to split its execution across CPU modes to\rtake advantage of CPU mode-specific features. This allows KVM/ARM to leverage\rLinux kernel services and functionality to simplify hypervisor development and\rmaintainability while utilizing recent ARM hardware virtualization extensions to\rrun application workloads in guest operating systems with comparable performance\rto native execution. KVM/ARM has been successfully merged into the mainline\rLinux 3.9 kernel, ensuring that it will gain wide adoption as the virtualization\rplatform of choice for ARM. We provide the first measurements on real hardware\rof a complete hypervisor using ARM hardware virtualization support. Our results\rdemonstrate that KVM/ARM has modest virtualization performance and power costs,\rand can achieve lower performance and power costs compared to x86-based Linux\rvirtualization on multicore hardware.

System reliability is a critical requirement of cyber-physical systems. An unreliable CPS often leads to system malfunctions, service disruptions, financial losses and even human life. Improving CPS reliability requires an objective measurement, estimation and comparison of the CPS system reliability. This paper describes FARE (Failure Analysis and Reliability Estimation), a framework for benchmarking reliability of cyber-physical systems. Some prior researches have proposed reliability benchmark for some specific CPS such as wind power plant and wireless sensor networks. There were also some prior researches on the components of CPS such as software and some specific hardware. But according to the best of our knowledge, there isnâ€™t any reliability benchmark framework for CPS in general. FARE framework provides a CPS reliability model, a set of methods and metrics on the evaluation environment selection, failure analysis and reliability estimation for benchmarking CPS reliability. It not only provides a retrospect evaluation and estimation of the CPS system reliability using the past data, but also provides a mechanism for continuous monitoring and evaluation of CPS reliability for runtime enhancement. The framework is extensible for accommodating new reliability measurement techniques and metrics. It is also generic and applicable to a wide range of CPS applications. For empirical study, we applied the FARE framework on a smart building management system for a large commercial building in New York City. Our experiments showed that FARE is easy to implement, accurate for comparison and can be used for building useful industry benchmarks and standards after accumulating enough data.

The broad idea is to encrypt the data used as inputs to hardware circuits to make it more difficult for malicious attackers to exploit hardware trojans. The two methods we discuss are data obfuscation and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Data obfuscation is a technique wherein specific data inputs are encrypted so that they can be operated on within a hardware module without exposing the data itself to the hardware. FHE is a technique recently discovered to be theoretically possible. With FHE, not only the data but also the operations and the entire circuit are encrypted. FHE primarily exists as a theoretical construct currently. It has been shown that it can theoretically be applied to any program or circuit. It has also been applied in a limited respect to some software. Some initial algorithms for hardware applications have been proposed. We find that data obfuscation is efficient enough to be immediately practical, while FHE is not yet in the practical realm. There are also scalability concerns regarding current algorithms for FHE.

Social\rComputing research focuses on online social behavior and using\rartifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other\ruseful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and\rknowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy,\rwhich is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as\rregulated differently in different locales.

We highlight some of the\rrelevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal\rComputing.\rWe feel that\rthese topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence\ras they will provide useful avenues of research leading to\rincreasing benefits for society as a whole.\rThis thesis will consist of the following four projects that aim to address the issues of Societal Computing.\r\rFirst, privacy in the context of ubiquitous social computing systems has become a\rmajor concern for society at large.\rAs the number of online social computing systems that collect user data\rgrows, concerns with privacy are further exacerbated.\rExamples of such online systems include social networks, recommender systems, and so on.\rApproaches to addressing these privacy concerns typically require\rsubstantial extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where\rprivacy is concerned, but may have significant negative impact with respect\rto Green Computing and sustainability, another major societal concern.\rSpending more computation time results in spending more energy and other\rresources that make the software system less sustainable.\rIdeally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems\rthat address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable --- systems\rwhere privacy could be achieved ``for free,'' \\ie without having to spend\rextra computational effort.\rWe describe how privacy can indeed be achieved for free --- an\raccidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation --- in web applications and online systems that have access to user data.\rWe show the feasibility, sustainability, and utility of our approach and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.\r\rSecond, we aim to understand what the expectations and needs to end-users and software developers are, with respect to privacy in social systems.\rSome questions that we want to answer are:\rDo end-users care about privacy?\rWhat aspects of privacy are the most important to end-users?\rDo we need different privacy mechanisms for technical vs. non-technical users?\rShould we customize privacy settings and systems based on the geographic location of the users?\rWe have created a large scale user study using an online questionnaire to gather privacy requirements from a variety of stakeholders.\rWe also plan to conduct follow-up semi-structured interviews.\rThis user study will help us answer these questions.\r\rThird, a related challenge to above, is to make privacy more understandable in complex systems that may have a variety of user interface options, which may change often.\rOur approach is to use crowdsourcing to find out how other users deal with privacy and what settings are commonly used to give users feedback on aspects like how public/private their settings are, what common settings are typically used by others, where do a certain users' settings differ from a trusted group of friends, etc.\rWe have a large dataset of privacy settings for over 500 users on Facebook and we plan to create a user study that will use the data to make privacy settings more understandable.\r\rFinally, end-users of such systems find it increasingly hard to understand complex privacy settings.\rAs software evolves over time, this might introduce bugs that breach users' privacy.\rFurther, there might be system-wide policy changes that could change users' settings to be more or less private than before.\rWe present a novel technique that can be used by \\emph{end-users} for detecting changes in privacy, \\ie regression testing for privacy.\rUsing a social approach for detecting privacy bugs, we present two prototype tools.\rOur evaluation shows the feasibility and utility of our approach for detecting privacy bugs.\rWe highlight two interesting case studies on the bugs that were discovered using our tools.\rTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first technique that leverages regression testing for detecting privacy bugs from an end-user perspective.

This paper presents a floor\rlocalization system intended for emergency calls.  We aim to provide\rfloor-level accuracy with minimum infrastructure support.  Our\rapproach is to use multiple sensors, all available in today's\rsmartphones, to trace a user's vertical movements inside buildings.\r\rWe make three contributions.  First, we present a hybrid architecture\rfor floor localization with emergency calls in mind.  The architecture\rcombines beacon-based infrastructure and sensor-based dead reckoning,\rstriking the right balance between accurately determining a user's\rlocation and minimizing the required infrastructure.  Second, we\rpresent the elevator module for tracking a user's movement in an\relevator.  The elevator module addresses three core challenges that\rmake it difficult to accurately derive displacement from acceleration.\rThird, we present the stairway module which determines the number of\rfloors a user has traveled on foot.  Unlike previous systems that\rtrack users' foot steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing\rcounting technique.

Yet, advanced alias analyses are extremely difficult to get right, and the bugs in these analyses are most likely the reason that they have not been adopted to production compilers. This paper presents NEONGOBY, a system for effectively detecting errors in alias analysis implementations, improving their correctness and hopefully widening their adoption. NEONGOBY works by dynamically observing pointer addresses during the execution of a test program and then checking these addresses against an alias analysis for errors. It is explicitly designed to (1) be agnostic to the alias analysis it checks for maximum applicability and ease of use and (2) detect alias analysis errors that manifest on real-world programs and workloads. It reduces false positives and performance overhead using a practical selection of techniques. Evaluation on three popular alias analyses and real-world programs Apache and MySQL shows that NEONGOBY effectively finds 29 alias analysis bugs with only 2 false positives and reasonable overhead. To enable alias analysis builders to start using NEONGOBY today, we have released it open-source at https://github.com/wujingyue/neongoby, along with our error detection results and proposed patches.

Marginal inference, however, even for this restricted class, is in \\#P. We prove new formulations of derivatives of the Bethe free energy, provide bounds on the derivatives and bracket the locations of stationary points, introducing a new technique called Bethe bound propagation. Several results apply to pairwise models whether associative or not. Applying these to discretized pseudo-marginals in the associative case we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for global optimization provided the maximum degree is $O(\\log n)$, and discuss several extensions.

Edwards                    2012-12-27                    I describe in detail the circuitry of the original 1972 Pong video\rarcade game and how I reconstructed it on an FPGA -- a modern-day\rprogrammable logic device. In the original circuit, I discover some\rsloppy timing and a previously unidentified bug that subtly affected\rgameplay.  I emulate the quasi-synchronous behavior of the original\rcircuit by running a synchronous ``simulation'' circuit with a\r2X clock and replacing each flip-flop with a circuit that\reffectively simulates one.  The result is an accurate reproduction\rthat exhibits many idiosyncracies of the original.

Nayar                    2012-11-29                    A conventional camera has a limited depth of field (DOF), which often results in defocus blur and loss of image detail. The technique of image refocusing allows a user\rto interactively change the plane of focus and DOF of an image after it is captured. One way to achieve refocusing is to capture the entire light field. But this requires a significant compromise of spatial resolution. This is because of the dimensionality gap - the captured information (a light field) is 4-D, while the information required for refocusing (a focal stack) is only 3-D. \r\rIn this paper, we present an imaging system that directly captures a focal stack by physically sweeping the focal plane. We first describe how to sweep the focal plane \rso that the aggregate DOF of the focal stack covers the entire desired depth range without gaps or overlaps. Since the focal stack is captured in a duration of time when scene objects can move, we refer\rto the captured focal stack as a duration focal stack. We then propose an algorithm for computing a space-time in-focus index map from the focal stack, which represents the time at which each pixel is best focused. The algorithm is designed to enable a seamless refocusing experience, even for textureless regions and at depth discontinuities. \r\rWe have implemented two prototype focal-sweep cameras and captured several duration focal stacks.

The main findings were: (1) most of the students either misunderstood what metamorphic properties are or fell short of identifying all the metamorphic properties in their respective projects, (2) most of the students that were successful in finding all the metamorphic properties in their respective projects had incorporated certain arithmetic rules into their project logic, and (3) most of the properties identified were numerical metamorphic properties. A possible reason for this could be that the two relevant lectures given in class cited examples of metamorphic properties that were based on numerical properties. Based on the findings of the case study, pertinent suggestions were made in order to improve the impact of lectures provided for Metamorphic Testing.

Indoor positioning, however, presents a challenge because GPS\rdoes not generally work indoors.  Moreover, unlike outdoors, vertical\raccuracy is critical indoors because an error of few meters will send\remergency responders to a different floor in a building. \r\rThis paper presents an indoor positioning system which focuses on\rimproving the accuracy of vertical location.  We aim to provide\rfloor-level accuracy with minimal infrastructure support.  Our\rapproach is to use multiple sensors available in today's smartphones\rto trace users' vertical movements inside buildings.\r\rWe make three contributions.  First, we present the elevator module\rfor tracking a user's movement in elevators.  The elevator module\raddresses three core challenges that make it difficult to accurately\rderive displacement from acceleration.  Second, we present the\rstairway module which determines the number of floors a user has\rtraveled on foot.  Unlike previous systems that track users' foot\rsteps, our stairway module uses a novel landing counting technique.\rThird, we present a hybrid architecture that combines the sensor-based\rcomponents with minimal and practical infrastructure.  The\rinfrastructure provides initial anchor and periodic corrections of a\ruser's vertical location indoors.  The architecture strikes the right\rbalance between the accuracy of location and the feasibility of\rdeployment for the purpose of emergency communication.

Unreliable systems can lead to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability. We have implemented ARIS in a large commercial building cyber-physical system in New York City, and our experiment has shown that it is effective and efficient in improving building system reliability.

Barker, Martha A. Kim, Kenneth A. Ross                    2012-09-05                    With global pool of data growing at over 2.5 quinitillion bytes per day and over 90% of all data in existence created in the last two years alone [23], there can be little doubt that we have entered the big data era. This trend has brought database performance to the forefront of high throughput, low energy system design. This paper explores targeted deploy- ment of hardware accelerators to improve the throughput and efficiency of database processing. Partitioning, a critical operation when manipulating large data sets, is often the limiting factor in database performance, and represents a significant amount of the overall runtime of database processing workloads.\rThis paper describes a hardware-software streaming framework and a hardware accelerator for range partitioning, or HARP. The streaming framework offers seamless execution environment for database processing elements such as HARP. HARP offers performance, as well as orders of magnitude gains in power and area efficiency. A detailed analysis of a 32nm physical design shows 9.3 times the throughput of a highly optimized and optimistic software implementation, while consuming just 3.6% of the area and 2.6% of the power of a single Xeon core in the same technology generation.

Automated error reporting tools can assist in bug report generation but without precise steps from the end user it is often difficult for developers to recreate the failure. Advanced remote debugging tools aim to capture sufficient information from field executions to recreate failures in the lab but often have too much overhead to practically deploy. We present CHRONICLER, an approach to remote debugging that captures non-deterministic inputs to applications in a lightweight manner, assuring faithful reproduction of client executions. We evaluated CHRONICLER by creating a Java implementation, CHRONICLERJ, and then by using a set of benchmarks mimicking real world applications and workloads, showing its runtime overhead to be under 10% in most cases (worst case 86%), while an existing tool showed overhead over 100% in the same cases (worst case 2,322%).

Adapted from a similar algorithm proposed by\rRugina and Rinard for imperative languages, it essentially inlines a\rfunction in itself as many times as requested.  This algorithm aims to\rincrease the available parallelism in recursive functions, with an eye\rtoward its eventual application in a Haskell-to-hardware compiler. We\rfirst illustrate the technique on a series of examples, then describe\rthe algorithm, and finally show its Haskell source, which operates as\ra plug-in for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

Ross                    2012-05-15                    Heavy hitters are data items that occur at high frequency\rin a data set. Heavy hitters are among the most important\ritems for an organization to summarize and understand dur-\ring analytical processing. In data sets with sufficient skew,\rthe number of heavy hitters can be relatively small. We\rtake advantage of this small footprint to compute aggregate\rfunctions for the heavy hitters in fast cache memory.\rWe design cache-resident, shared-nothing structures that\rhold only the most frequent elements from the table. Our\rapproach works in three phases. It first samples and picks\rheavy hitter candidates. It then builds a hash table and\rcomputes the exact aggregates of these candidates. Finally,\rif necessary, a validation step identifies the true heavy hitters\rfrom among the candidates based on the query specification.\rWe identify trade-offs between the hash table capacity and\rperformance. Capacity determines how many candidates\rcan be aggregated. We optimize performance by the use of\rperfect hashing and SIMD instructions. SIMD instructions\rare utilized in novel ways to minimize cache accesses, be-\ryond simple vectorized operations. We use bucketized and\rcuckoo hash tables to increase capacity, to adapt to different\rdatasets and query constraints.\rThe performance of our method is an order of magnitude\rfaster than in-memory aggregation over a complete set of\ritems if those items cannot be cache resident. Even for item\rsets that are cache resident, our SIMD techniques enable\rsignificant performance improvements over previous work.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Improving Efficiency and Reliability of Building Systems Using Machine Learning and Automated Online Evaluation                                        Leon Wu, Gail Kaiser, David Solomon, Rebecca Winter, Albert Boulanger, Roger Anderson                    2012-05-04                    A high percentage of newly-constructed commercial office buildings experience energy consumption that exceeds specifications and system failures after being put into use. This problem is even worse for older buildings. We present a new approach, ‘predictive building energy optimization’, which uses machine learning (ML) and automated online evaluation of historical and real-time building data to improve efficiency and reliability of building operations without requiring large amounts of additional capital investment. Our ML approach uses a predictive model to generate accurate energy demand forecasts and automated analyses that can guide optimization of building operations. In parallel, an automated online evaluation system monitors efficiency at multiple stages in the system workflow and provides building operators with continuous feedback. We implemented a prototype of this application in a large commercial building in Manhattan. Our predictive machine learning model applies Support Vector Regression (SVR) to the building’s historical energy use and temperature and wet-bulb humidity data from the building’s interior and exterior in order to model performance for each day. This predictive model closely approximates actual energy usage values, with some seasonal and occupant-specific variability, and the dependence of the data on day-of-the-week makes the model easily applicable to different types of buildings with minimal adjustment. In parallel, an automated online evaluator monitors the building’s internal and external conditions, control actions and the results of those actions. Intelligent real-time data quality analysis components quickly detect anomalies and automatically transmit feedback to building management, who can then take necessary preventive or corrective actions. Our experiments show that this evaluator is responsive and effective in further ensuring reliable and energy-efficient operation of building systems.

Defocus causes the loss of image details. To recover scene details from a defocused region, deblurring techniques must be employed. It is well known that the deblurring quality is closely related to the defocus kernel or point-spread-function (PSF), whose shape is largely determined by the aperture pattern of the camera. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework of aperture evaluation for the purpose of defocus deblurring, which takes the effects of image noise, deblurring algorithm, and the structure of natural images into account. By using the derived evaluation criterion, we are able to solve for the optimal coded aperture patterns. Extensive simulations and experiments are then conducted to compare the optimized coded apertures with previously proposed ones.\r\rThe proposed framework of aperture evaluation is further extended to evaluate and optimize extended depth of field (EDOF) cameras. EDOF cameras (e.g., focal sweep and wavefront coding camera) are designed to produce PSFs which are less sensitive to depth variation, so that people can deconvolve the whole image using a single PSF without knowing scene depth. Different choices of camera parameters or the PSF to deconvolve with lead to different deblurring qualities. With the derived evaluation criterion, we are able to derive the optimal PSF to deconvolve with in a closed-form and optimize camera parameters for the best deblurring results.

Multidimensional access methods aim to provide efficient access to large data sets when queries apply predicates to some of the data dimensions. We examine multidimensional access methods in the context of an in-memory column store tuned for on-line analytical processing or scientific data analysis. We propose a multidimensional data structure that contains a novel combination of a grid array and several bitmaps. The base data is clustered in an order matching that of the index structure. The bitmaps contain one bit per block of data, motivating the\rterm ``blockmap.'' The proposed data structures are compact, typically taking less than one bit of space per row of data. Partition boundaries can be chosen in a way that reflects both the query workload and the data distribution, and boundaries are not required to evenly divide the data if there is a bias in the query distribution. We examine the theoretical performance of the data structure and experimentally measure its performance on three modern CPUs and one GPU processor. We demonstrate that efficient multidimensional access can be achieved with minimal space overhead.

Oliver Cossairt, Mohit Gupta, Shree Nayar                    2012-03-24                    A number of computational imaging techniques have been introduced to improve image quality by increasing light throughput. These techniques use optical coding to measure a stronger signal level. However, the performance of these techniques is limited by the decoding step, which amplifies noise. While it is well understood that optical coding can increase performance at low light levels, little is known about the quantitative performance advantage of computational imaging in general settings. In this paper, we derive the performance bounds for various computational imaging techniques. We then discuss the implications of these bounds for several real-world scenarios (illumination conditions, scene properties and sensor noise characteristics). Our results show that computational imaging techniques provide a significant performance advantage in a surprisingly small set of real world settings. These results can be readily used by practitioners to design the most suitable imaging systems given the application at hand.

In our previous project, we focused on the scalability aspect of SIP services on cloud platforms; the focus of this project is on the high availability aspect. We investigated the effects of component fault on service availability with the goal of understanding how high availability can be guaranteed even in the face of component faults. The experiments were conducted empirically on a real system that runs on Amazon EC2. Our analysis shows that most component faults are masked with a simple automatic failover technique. However, we have also identified fundamental problems that cannot be addressed by simple failover techniques; a problem involving DNS cache in resolvers and a problem involving static failover configurations. Recommendations on how to solve these problems are included in the report.

Permutation of the order of the input data\r2. Addition of numerical values by a constant\r3. Multiplication of numerical values by a constant\r4. Reversal of the order of the input data\r5. Removal of part of the data\r6. Addition of data to the dataset\rWhile focusing on permutative, additive, and multiplicative properties in functions and\rapplications, I have sought to identify common programming constructs and code\rfragments that strongly indicate that these properties will hold, or fail to hold, along an\rexecution path in which the code is evaluated.

Keromytis                    2012-01-24                    One of the primary concerns of users of cloud-based services and applications is the risk of unauthorized access to their private information. For the common setting in which the infrastructure provider and the online service provider are different, end users have to trust their data to both parties, although they interact solely with the service provider. This paper presents CloudFence, a framework that allows users to independently audit the treatment of their private data by third-party online services, through the intervention of the cloud provider that hosts these services.\rCloudFence is based on a fine-grained data flow tracking platform exposed by the cloud provider to both developers of cloud-based applications, as well as their users. Besides data auditing for end users, CloudFence allows service providers to confine the use of sensitive data in well-defined domains using data tracking at arbitrary granularity, offering additional protection against inadvertent leaks and unauthorized access. The results of our experimental evaluation with real-world applications, including an e-store platform and a cloud-based backup service, demonstrate that CloudFence requires just a few changes to existing application code, while it can detect and prevent a wide range of security breaches, ranging from data leakage attacks using SQL injection, to personal data disclosure due to missing or erroneously implemented access control checks.

Power grid\rfailures lead to huge financial cost and affect peopleâ€™s life. Using\ra statistical analysis and holistic approach, this paper analyzes\rthe New York City power grid failures: failure patterns and\rclimatic effects. Our findings include: higher peak electrical load\rincreases likelihood of power grid failure; increased subsequent\rfailures among electrical feeders sharing the same substation;\runderground feeders fail less than overhead feeders; cables and\rjoints installed during certain years are more likely to fail; higher\rweather temperature leads to more power grid failures. We further\rsuggest preventive maintenance, intertemporal consumption,\rand electrical load optimization for failure prevention. We also\restimated that the predictability of the power grid component\rfailures correlates with the cycles of the North Atlantic Oscillation\r(NAO) Index.

The proposal sparked intense debate and follow- on research, but ultimately failed to win over the net- working community. Fifteen years later, the problems that motivated the active networks proposal persist.\rWe call for a revival of active networks. We present NetServ, a fully integrated active network system that provides all the necessary functionality to be deployable, addressing the core problems that prevented the practical success of earlier approaches.\rWe make the following contributions. We present a hybrid approach to active networking, which combines the best qualities from the two extreme approachesï¿½ integrated and discrete. We built a working system that strikes the right balance between security and perfor- mance by leveraging current technologies. We suggest an economic model based on NetServ between content providers and ISPs. We built four applications to illus- trate the model.

By mining publicly available data, we collected a dataset consisting of the complete player history for approximately six million characters, with partial data for another six million characters. The paper provides a thorough description of the distributed approach used to collect this massive community data set, and then focuses on an analysis of player achievement data in particular, exposing trends in play from this highly successful game.\rFrom this data, we present several findings regarding player profiles. We correlate achievements with motivations based upon a previously-defined motivation model, and then classify players based on the categories of achievements that they pursued. Experiments show players who fall within each of these buckets can play differently, and that as players progress through game content, their play style evolves as well.

Our implementation\ris based on CCNx, a reference implementation of content\rrouter. The current prototype consists of two components:\rgit-daemon-ccnx allows a node to publish its local Git\rrepositories to CCNx Content Store; git-remote-ccnx implements\rCCNx transport on the client side.

They  serve  a  large  portion  of  the  multimedia on the Internet and solve problems of scalability and indirectly network congestion (at a price). However, most content delivery networks  rely  on  a  statically  deployed  configuration  of  nodes and  network  topology  that  makes  it  hard  to  grow  and  scale dynamically. We present ActiveCDN, a novel CDN architecture that allows a content publisher to dynamically scale their content delivery services using network virtualization and cloud computing techniques.

Kemerlis, Georgios Portokalidis, Kangkook Jee, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2011-10-27                    Dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) deals with the tagging and tracking of \"interesting\" data as they propagate during program execution. DFT has been repeatedly implemented by a variety of tools for numerous purposes, including protection from zero-day and cross-site scripting attacks, detection and prevention of information leaks, as well as for the analysis of legitimate and malicious software. We present libdft, a dynamic DFT framework that unlike previous work is at once fast, reusable, and works with commodity software and hardware. libdft provides an API, which can be used to painlessly deliver DFT-enabled tools that can be applied on unmodified binaries, running on common operating systems and hardware, thus facilitating research and rapid prototyping.\r\rWe explore different approaches for implementing the low-level aspects of instruction-level data tracking, introduce a more efficient and 64-bit capable shadow memory, and identify (and avoid) the common pitfalls responsible for the excessive performance overhead of previous studies. We evaluate libdft using real applications with large codebases like the Apache and MySQL servers, and the Firefox web browser. We also use a series of benchmarks and utilities to compare libdft with similar systems. Our results indicate that it performs at least as fast, if not faster, than previous solutions, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate the performance overhead of a fast dynamic DFT implementation in such depth. Finally, our implementation is freely available as open source software.

Swapneel Sheth, Tal Malkin, Gail Kaiser                    2011-10-10                    Privacy in the context of ubiquitous social computing systems has become a major concern for the society at large.\rAs the number of online social computing systems that collect user data grows, this privacy threat is further exacerbated.\rThere has been some work (both, recent and older) on addressing these privacy concerns.\rThese approaches typically require extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where privacy is concerned, but when dealing with Green Computing and sustainability, this is not a great option.\rSpending more computation time results in spending more energy and more resources that make the software system less sustainable.\rIdeally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable - systems where privacy could be achieved ``for free,'' i.e., without having to spend extra computational effort.\rIn this paper, we describe how privacy can be achieved for free - an accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation - and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.\rMore precisely, we describe a ``Privacy for Free'' design pattern and show its feasibility, sustainability, and utility in building complex social computing systems.

One of the simplest ways to reduce energy usage is by making current buildings less wasteful. By improving energy efficiency, this method of lowering our carbon footprint is particularly worthwhile because it reduces energy costs of operating the building, unlike many environmental initiatives that require large monetary investments. In order to improve the efficiency of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a Manhattan skyscraper, 345 Park Avenue, a predictive computer model was designed to forecast the amount of energy the building will consume. This model uses Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), a method that builds a regression based purely on historical data of the building, requiring no knowledge of its size, heating and cooling methods, or any other physical properties. SVMR employs time-delay coordinates as a representation of the past to create the feature vectors for SVM training. This pure dependence on historical data makes the model very easily applicable to different types of buildings with few model adjustments. The SVM regression model was built to predict a week of future energy usage based on past energy, temperature, and dew point temperature data.

This assumption no longer holds \rwhen data is outsourced to a third-party storage provider, such as the \\emph{cloud}.\rExisting access control solutions mainly focus on preserving confidentiality of stored \rdata from unauthorized access and the storage provider. \rHowever, in this setting, access control policies as \rwell as users' access patterns also become privacy sensitive information that \rshould be protected from the cloud. We propose a two-level access control scheme\rthat combines coarse-grained access control enforced at the cloud, which allows to get \racceptable communication overhead and at the same time limits the information that \rthe cloud learns from his partial view of the access rules and the access patterns, \rand fine-grained cryptographic access control enforced at the user's side, which provides the desired expressiveness \rof the access control policies. Our solution handles both \\emph{read} and \\emph{write} access control.

An unreliable system\roften leads to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. This thesis aims\rto improve system reliability for cyber-physical systems that meet following criteria: processing\rlarge amount of data; employing software as a system component; running online continuously;\rhaving operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirement for safety\rcritical systems. The reason that I limit the system scope to this type of cyber-physical system is\rthat this type of cyber-physical systems are important and becoming more prevalent.\rTo improve system reliability for this type of cyber-physical systems, I propose a system\revaluation approach named automated online evaluation. It works in parallel with the cyber-physical\rsystem to conduct automated evaluation at the multiple stages along the workflow of\rthe system continuously and provide operator-in-the-loop feedback on reliability improvement.\rIt is an approach whereby data from cyber-physical system is evaluated. For example, abnormal\rinput and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts\rcan be sent to the operator-in-the-loop. The operator can then take actions and make changes to\rthe system based on the alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system\rreliability. To implement the proposed approach, I further propose a system architecture named\rARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System).\rOne technique used by the approach is data quality analysis using computational intelligence\rthat applies computational intelligence in evaluating data quality in some automated and efficient\rway to ensure data quality and make sure the running system to perform as expected reliably.\rThe computational intelligence is enabled by machine learning, data mining, statistical and probabilistic\ranalysis, and other intelligent techniques. In a cyber-physical system, the data collected\rfrom the system, e.g., software bug reports, system status logs and error reports, are stored in\rsome databases. In my approach, these data are analyzed via data mining and other intelligent\rtechniques so that useful information on system reliability including erroneous data and abnormal\rsystem state can be concluded. These reliability related information are directed to operators so\rthat proper actions can be taken, sometimes proactively based on the predictive results, to ensure\rthe proper and reliable execution of the system.\rAnother technique used by the approach is self-tuning that automatically self-manages and\rself-configures the evaluation system to ensure it adapts itself based on the changes in the system\rand feedback from the operator. The self-tuning adapts the evaluation system to ensure its proper\rfunctioning, which leads to a more robust evaluation system and improved system reliability.\rFor feasibility study of the proposed approach, I first present NOVA (Neutral Online Visualization-aided\rAutonomic) system, a data quality analysis system for improving system reliability for\rpower grid cyber-physical system. I then present a feasibility study on effectiveness of some\rself-tuning techniques, including data classification, redundancy checking and trend detection.\rThe self-tuning leads to an adaptive evaluation system that works better under system changes\rand operator feedback, which will lead to improved system reliability.\rThe contribution of the work is an automated online evaluation approach that is able to improve\rsystem reliability for cyber-physical systems in the domain of interest as indicated above. It\renables online reliability assurance of the deployed systems that are not possible to perform robust\rtests prior to actual deployment.

This thesis focuses mostly on images of faces and the attributes used to describe them, although the concepts also apply to other domains.  Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc.  The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: they can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large datasets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images.  These classifiers can then automatically label new images.\r\rWe demonstrate the current effectiveness and explore the future potential of using attributes for image search, automatic face replacement in images, and face verification, via both human and computational experiments. To aid other researchers in studying these problems, we introduce two new large face datasets, named FaceTracer and PubFig, with labeled attributes and identities, respectively.\r\rFinally, we also show the effectiveness of visual attributes in a completely different domain: plant species identification. To this end, we have developed and publicly released the Leafsnap system, which has been downloaded by over half a million users. The mobile phone application is a flexible electronic field guide with high-quality images of the tree species in the Northeast US. It also gives users instant access to our automatic recognition system, greatly simplifying the identification process.

However, the Internet connectivity is intermittent because passengers can access the Internet only when a bus or a train is within the networking coverage of an access point at a stop. To efficiently handle this intermittent network for the public transit system, we propose Internet Cache on Wheels (ICOW), a system that provides a low-cost way for bus and train operators to offer access to Internet content. Each bus or train car is equipped with a smart cache that serves popular content to passengers. The cache updates its content based on passenger requests when it is within range of Internet access points placed at bus stops, train stations or depots. We have developed a system architecture and built a prototype of the ICOW system.  Our evaluation and analysis show that ICOW is significantly more efficient than having passengers contact Internet access points individually and ensures continuous availability of content throughout the journey.

To help in meeting this challenge, we present the Neutral Online Visualization-aided Autonomic evaluation framework (NOVA) for evaluating machine learning and data mining algorithms for preventive maintenance on the electrical grid. NOVA has three stages provided through a unified user interface: evaluation of input data quality, evaluation of machine learning and data mining results, and evaluation of the reliability improvement of the power grid. A prototype version of NOVA has been deployed for the power grid in New York City, and it is able to evaluate machine learning and data mining systems effectively\rand efficiently.

Carloni                    2011-06-21                    Networks-on-chip (NoC) are critical to the design\rof complex multi-core system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. Since\rSoCs are characterized by a combination of high performance\rrequirements and stringent energy constraints, NoCs must be\rrealized with low-power design techniques. Since the use of semicustom\rdesign flow based on standard-cell technology libraries is\ressential to cope with the SoC design complexity challenges under\rtight time-to-market constraints, NoC must be implemented\rusing logic synthesis. In this paper we analyze the major power\rreduction that clock gating can deliver when applied to the\rsynthesis of a NoC in the context of a semi-custom automated\rdesign flow.

However, we believe that if exposed to testing early, students will develop positive habits for future work. As we have found that students typically are not keen on testing, we propose an engaging and socially-oriented approach to teaching software testing in introductory and intermediate computer science courses. Our proposal leverages the power of gaming utilizing our previously described system HALO. Unlike many previous approaches, we aim to present software testing in disguise - so that students do not recognize (at first) that they are being exposed to software testing. We describe how HALO could be integrated into course assignments as well as the benefits that HALO creates.

Stolfo, Tony Jebara                    2011-06-15                    Modern network security research has demonstrated a clear need for open sharing of traffic datasets between organizations, a need that has so far been superseded by the challenge of removing sensitive content beforehand. Network Data Anonymization (NDA) is emerging as a field dedicated to this problem, with its main direction focusing on removal of identifiable artifacts that might pierce privacy, such as usernames and IP addresses. However, recent research has demonstrated that more subtle statistical artifacts, also present, may yield fingerprints that are just as differentiable as the former. This result highlights certain shortcomings in current anonymization frameworks -- particularly, ignoring the behavioral idiosyncrasies of network protocols, applications, and users. Recent anonymization results have shown that the extent to which utility and privacy can be obtained is mainly a function of the information in the data that one is aware and not aware of. This paper leverages the predictability of network behavior in our favor to augment existing frameworks through a new machine-learning-driven anonymization technique. Our approach uses the substitution of individual identities with group identities where members are divided based on behavioral similarities, essentially providing anonymity-by-crowds in a statistical mix-net. We derive time-series models for network traffic behavior which quantifiably models the discriminative features of network \"behavior\" and introduce a kernel-based framework for anonymity which fits together naturally with network-data modeling.

In this paper, we present an in-depth\rstudy of concurrency attacks and how they may affect existing\rdefenses. Our study yields several interesting findings.\rFor instance, we find that concurrency attacks can\rcorrupt non-pointer data, such as user identifiers, which\rexisting memory-safety defenses cannot handle. Inspired\rby our findings, we propose new defense directions and\rfixes to existing defenses.

In this paper, we first describe a general fault model for con- current programs and some limitations of previously developed sets of first-order concurrency mutation operators. We then present our new mutation testing approach, which em- ploys synchronization-centric second-order mutation operators that are able to generate subtle concurrency bugs not represented by the first-order mutation. These operators are used in addition to the synchronization-centric first-order mutation operators to form a small set of effective concurrency mutation operators for mutant generation. Our empirical study shows that our set of operators is effective in mutant generation with limited cost and demonstrates that this new approach is easy to implement.

These accumulated bug reports may contain valuable information that could be used to improve the quality of the bug reporting, reduce the quality assurance effort and cost, analyze software re- liability, and predict future bug report trend. In this paper, we present BUGMINER, a tool that is able to derive useful information from historic bug report database using data mining, use these information to do completion check and redundancy check on a new or given bug report, and to estimate the bug report trend using statistical analysis. Our empirical studies of the tool using several real-world bug report repositories show that it is effective, easy to implement, and has relatively high accuracy despite low quality data.

It is related to high-dimensional numerical\rintegration of certain function classes as expressed by the Koksma-Hlawka\rinequality. A sharp version of this inequality states that the worst-case error of approximating\rthe integral of functions from the unit ball of some Sobolev space by\ran equal-weight cubature is exactly the star discrepancy of the set of sample points.\rIn many applications, as, e.g., in physics, quantum chemistry or finance, it is essential\rto approximate high-dimensional integrals. Thus with regard to the Koksma-\rHlawka inequality the following three questions are very important:\r(i) What are good bounds with explicitly given dependence on the dimension d for\rthe smallest possible discrepancy of any n-point set for moderate n?\r(ii) How can we construct point sets efficiently that satisfy such bounds?\r(iii) How can we calculate the discrepancy of given point sets efficiently?\rWe want to discuss these questions and survey and explain some approaches to\rtackle them relying on metric entropy, randomization, and derandomization.

We present a new algorithm for estimating the star discrepancy of arbitrary point\rsets. Similar to the algorithm for discrepancy approximation of Winker and Fang [SIAM J. Numer.\rAnal. 34 (1997), 2028{2042] it is based on the optimization algorithm threshold accepting. Our\rimprovements include, amongst others, a non-uniform sampling strategy which is more suited for\rhigher-dimensional inputs and additionally takes into account the topological characteristics of given\rpoint sets, and rounding steps which transform axis-parallel boxes, on which the discrepancy is to be\rtested, into critical test boxes. These critical test boxes provably yield higher discrepancy values, and\rcontain the box that exhibits the maximum value of the local discrepancy. We provide comprehensive\rexperiments to test the new algorithm. Our randomized algorithm computes the exact discrepancy\rfrequently in all cases where this can be checked (i.e., where the exact discrepancy of the point set\rcan be computed in feasible time). Most importantly, in higher dimension the new method behaves\rclearly better than all previously known methods.

We present Cells, a\rvirtualization architecture for enabling multiple virtual\rsmartphones to run simultaneously on the same physical cellphone\rdevice in a securely isolated manner.  Cells introduces a usage model\rof having one foreground virtual phone and multiple background\rvirtual phones.  This model enables a new device namespace mechanism\rand novel device proxies that integrate with lightweight operating system virtualization to efficiently and securely multiplex phone hardware devices across multiple virtual phones while providing native hardware device performance to all applications.  Virtual phone features\rinclude fully-accelerated graphics for gaming, complete power\rmanagement features, and full telephony functionality with separately \rassignable telephone numbers and caller ID support.  We have\rimplemented a Cells prototype that supports multiple Android virtual\rphones on the same phone hardware.  Our performance results\rdemonstrate that Cells imposes only modest runtime and memory \roverhead, works seamlessly across multiple hardware devices including\rGoogle Nexus 1 and Nexus S phones and an NVIDIA tablet, and transparently runs all existing Android applications without any modifications.

Stolfo                    2011-05-06                    Masquerade attacks are characterized by an adversary stealing\ra legitimate user's credentials and using them to impersonate the victim\rand perform malicious activities, such as stealing information. Prior work\ron masquerade attack detection has focused on proling legitimate user behavior\rand detecting abnormal behavior indicative of a masquerade attack.\rLike any anomaly-detection based techniques, detecting masquerade attacks\rby proling user behavior suers from a signicant number of false positives.\rWe extend prior work and provide a novel integrated detection approach in\rthis paper. We combine a user behavior proling technique with a baiting\rtechnique in order to more accurately detect masquerade activity. We show\rthat using this integrated approach reduces the false positives by 36% when\rcompared to user behavior proling alone, while achieving almost perfect detection\rresults.We also show how this combined detection approach serves as\ra mechanism for hardening the masquerade attack detector against mimicry\rattacks.

However,\rexisting failure diagnosis techniques fail to assist the endusers\rin accessing the applications and services.\rWe present DYSWIS, an automatic network fault detection\rand diagnosis system for end-users. The key idea is\rcollaboration of end-users; a node requests multiple nodes\rto diagnose a network fault in real time to collect diverse information\rfrom different parts of the networks and infer the\rcause of failure. DYSWIS leverages DHT network to search\rthe collaborating nodes with appropriate network properties\rrequired to diagnose a failure. The framework allows dynamic\rupdating of rules and probes into a running system.\rAnother key aspect is contribution of expert knowledge (rules\rand probes) by application developers, vendors and network\radministrators; thereby enabling crowdsourcing of diagnosis\rstrategy for growing set of applications.\rWe have implemented the framework and the software\rand tested them using our test bed and PlanetLab to show\rthat several complex commonly occurring failures can be\rdetected and diagnosed successfully using DYSWIS, while\rsingle-user probe with traditional tools fails to pinpoint the\rcause of such failures. We validate that our base modules\rand rules are sufficient to detect infrastructural failures causing\rmajority of application failures.

We present NetServ, a programmable node architecture aimed\rat turning edge routers into distributed service hosting platforms.\rThis allows ISPs to allocate router resources to content publishers\rand application service pro\\-vi\\-ders motivated to deploy content and\rservices at the network edge.  This model provides important benefits\rover currently available solutions like CDN.  Content and services can\rbe brought closer to end users by dynamically installing and removing\rcustom modules as needed throughout the network.\r\rUnlike previous programmable router proposals which focused on\rcustomizing features of a router, NetServ focuses on deploying content\rand services.  All our design decisions reflect this change in focus.\rWe set three main design goals: a wide-area deployment, a multi-user\rexecution environment, and a clear economic benefit.  We built a\rprototype using Linux, NSIS signaling, and the Java OSGi framework.\rWe also implemented four prototype applications: ActiveCDN provides\rpublisher-specific content distribution and processing; KeepAlive\rResponder and Media Relay reduce the infrastructure needs of telephony\rproviders; and Overload Control makes it possible to deploy more\rflexible algorithms to handle excessive traffic.

This paper presents a\rnew method of estimating failure rate using a semiparametric\rmodel with Gaussian process smoothing. The method is able to\rprovide accurate estimation based on historical data and it does\rnot make strong a priori assumptions of failure rate pattern (e.g.,\rconstant or monotonic). Our experiments of applying this method\rin power system failure data compared with other models show\rits efficacy and accuracy. This method can be used in estimating\rreliability for many other systems, such as software systems or\rcomponents.

These short messages tend to reflect a variety of events in real time, earlier than other social media sites such as Flickr or YouTube, \rmaking Twitter particularly well suited as a source of real-time event content. In this paper, we explore approaches for analyzing the stream of Twitter messages to distinguish between messages about real-world events and non-event messages. Our approach relies on a rich family of aggregate statistics of topically similar message clusters, including temporal, social, topical, and Twitter-centric features. Our large-scale experiments over millions of Twitter messages show the effectiveness of our approach for surfacing real-world event content on Twitter.

Two major concerns in any concurrent program are data\rraces and deadlocks. Each are potentially subtle bugs that can be caused by nondeterministic\rscheduling choices in most concurrent formalisms. Unfortunately,\rtraditional race and deadlock detection techniques fail on both large programs, and\rsmall programs with complex behaviors.\rWe believe the solution is model-based design, where the programmer is presented\rwith a constrained higher-level language that prevents certain unwanted\rbehavior. We present the SHIM model that guarantees the absence of data races by\reschewing shared memory.\rThis dissertation provides SHIM based techniques that aid determinism - models\rthat guarantee determinism, compilers that generate deterministic code and\rlibraries that provide deterministic constructs. Additionally, we avoid deadlocks,\ra consequence of improper synchronization. A SHIM program may deadlock if it\rviolates a communication protocol. We provide efficient techniques for detecting\rand deterministically breaking deadlocks in programs that use the SHIM model.\rWe evaluate the efficiency of our techniques with a set of benchmarks. We\rhave also extended our ideas to other languages. The ultimate goal is to provide\rdeterministic deadlock-free concurrency along with efficiency. Our hope is that\rthese ideas will be used in the future while designing complex concurrent systems.

Bellovin                    2011-02-23                    Increasingly, people are sharing \rsensitive personal information via online social networks (OSN).\rWhile such networks do permit users to control what they share with whom,\raccess control policies are notoriously difficult to configure correctly;\rthis raises the question of whether OSN users' privacy settings match their sharing intentions. \rWe present the results of an empirical evaluation that measures privacy attitudes and intentions\rand compares these against the privacy settings on Facebook. Our results indicate a serious mismatch: every one of the 65 participants\rin our study confirmed that at least one of the identified violations was in fact a sharing violation.\rIn other words, OSN users' privacy settings are incorrect.\rFurthermore, a majority of users cannot or will not fix such errors.\rWe conclude that the current approach to privacy settings is fundamentally flawed\rand cannot be fixed;\ra fundamentally different approach is needed.

Raunak, Andrew King, Sanjien Chen, Christopher Imbriano, Gail Kaiser                    2011-02-04                    Health care professionals rely on software to simulate anatomical and\rphysiological elements of the human body for purposes of training, prototyping, and decision making. Software can also be used to simulate medical processes and protocols to measure cost effectiveness and resource utilization. Whereas much of the software engineering research into simulation software focuses on validation (determining that the simulation accurately models real-world activity), to date there has been little investigation into the testing of simulation software itself, that is, the ability to effectively search for errors in the implementation. This is particularly challenging because often there is no test oracle to indicate whether the results of the simulation are correct.  In this paper, we present an approach to systematically testing simulation software in the absence of test oracles, and evaluate the effectiveness of the technique.

These services range from the most basic voice-based services such as voice calls and voicemail to more advanced ones such as conferencing, voicemail-to-text, and online address books. Besides voice, modern VoIP systems provide video calls and video conferencing, presence, instant messaging (IM), and even desktop sharing services. These systems also let their users establish a voice, video, or a text session with devices in cellular, public switched telephone network (PSTN), or other VoIP networks.\r\rThe peer-to-peer (p2p) paradigm for building VoIP systems involves minimal or no use of managed servers and is therefore attractive from an administrative and economic perspective. However, the benefits of using p2p paradigm in VoIP systems are not without their challenges. First, p2p communication (VoIP) systems can be deployed in environ-\rments with varying requirements of scalability, connectivity, security, interoperability, and performance. These requirements bring forth the question of designing open and standardized protocols for diverse deployments. Second, the presence of restrictive network address\rtranslators (NATs) and firewalls prevents machines from directly exchanging packets and is problematic from the perspective of establishing direct media sessions. The p2p communication systems address this problem by using an intermediate peer with unrestricted\rconnectivity to relay the session or by preferring the use of TCP. This technique for addressing connectivity problems raises questions about the reliability and session quality of p2p communication systems compared with the traditional client-server VoIP systems. Third,\rwhile administrative overheads are likely to be lower in running p2p communication systems as compared to client-server, can the same be said about the energy efficiency? Fourth, what type of techniques can be used to gain insights into the performance of a deployed\rp2p VoIP system like Skype?\r\rThe thesis addresses the challenges in designing, building, and analyzing peer-to-peer communication systems. The thesis presents Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), an open protocol for building p2p communication systems with varying operational requirements. P2PP\ris now part of the IETF's P2PSIP protocol and is on track to become an RFC. The thesis describes the design and implementation of OpenVoIP, a proof-of-concept p2p communication system to demonstrate the feasibility of P2PP and to explore issues in building p2p communication systems. The thesis introduces a simple and novel analytical model for analyzing the reliability of peer-to-peer communication systems and analyzes the feasibility of TCP for sending real-time traffic. The thesis then analyzes the energy efficiency of peer-to-peer and client-server VoIP systems and shows that p2p VoIP systems are less energy efficient than client-server even if the peers consume a small amount of energy for running the p2p network. Finally, the thesis presents an analysis of the Skype protocol which indicates that Skype is free-riding on the network bandwidth of universities.

Keroymtis                    2011-02-03                    Anonymous communication networks like Tor\rpartially protect the confidentiality of their users' traffic by\rencrypting all intra-overlay communication.\rHowever, when the relayed traffic\rreaches the boundaries of the overlay network towards its actual\rdestination, the original user traffic is inevitably exposed.  At this\rpoint, unless end-to-end encryption is used, sensitive user data can\rbe snooped by a malicious or compromised exit node, or by any other\rrogue network entity on the path towards the actual destination.\r\rWe explore the use of decoy traffic for the detection of traffic\rinterception on anonymous proxying systems.  Our approach is based on\rthe injection of traffic that exposes bait credentials for decoy\rservices that require user authentication.  Our aim is to entice\rprospective eavesdroppers to access decoy accounts on servers under\rour control using the intercepted credentials.  We have deployed our\rprototype implementation in the Tor network using decoy IMAP and SMTP\rservers. During the course of six months, our system detected eight\rcases of traffic interception that involved eight different Tor exit\rnodes.  We provide a detailed analysis of the detected incidents,\rdiscuss potential improvements to our system, and outline how our\rapproach can be extended for the detection of HTTP session hijacking\rattacks.

Most applications are still sequential, and many cores on parallel machines remain unused. We propose a tool that uses data-dependence profiling and binary rewriting to parallelize executables without access to source code. Our technique uses Bernsteinï¿½s conditions to identify independent sets of basic blocks that\rcan be executed in parallel, introducing a level of granularity between fine-grained instruction level and coarse grained task level parallelism. We analyze dynamically generated control and data dependence graphs to find independent sets of basic blocks which can be parallelized.\rWe then propose to parallelize these candidates using binary rewriting techniques. Our technique aims to demonstrate the parallelism that remains in serial application by exposing concrete opportunities for parallelism.

Stolfo                    2011-01-30                    Masquerade attacks pose a grave security problem that is a consequence of identity theft. Detecting masqueraders is very hard. Prior work has focused on proling legitimate user behavior and detecting deviations from that normal behavior that could potentially signal an ongoing\rmasquerade attack. Such approaches suffer from high false positive rates.\rOther work investigated the use of trap-based mechanisms as a means\rfor detecting insider attacks in general. In this paper, we investigate the use of such trap-based mechanisms for the detection of masquerade at\rtacks. We evaluate the desirable properties of decoys deployed within a\ruser's file space for detection.We investigate the trade-os between these properties through two user studies, and propose recommendations for effective masquerade detection using decoy documents based on findings from our user studies.

Stolfo                    2011-01-30                    Real-world large-scale data collection poses an important\rchallenge in the security field. Insider and masquerader attack data collection poses even a greater challenge. Very few organizations acknowledge such breaches because of liability concerns and potential implications on their market value. This caused the scarcity of real-world data sets that could be used to study insider and masquerader attacks. In this paper, we present the design, technical, and procedural challenges encountered during our own masquerade data gathering project.

In the last decade, computational imaging has emerged as a vibrant field of research. A wide variety of computational cameras have been demonstrated - some designed to achieve new imaging functionalities and others to reduce the complexity of traditional imaging.\rIn this article, we describe how computational cameras have evolved and present a taxonomy for the technical approaches they use. We explore the benefits and limits of computational imaging, and describe how it is related to the adjacent and overlapping fields of digital imaging, computational photography and computational image sensors.

Novak, H. Wo´zniakowski, L2 discrepancy and multivariate integration, in: Analytic number theory. Essays in honour of Klaus Roth. W. W. L. Chen, W. T. Gowers, H. Halberstam, W. M. Schmidt, and R. C. Vaughan (Eds.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009, 359 – 388] to what we want to call weighted geometric L2-discrepancy. This extended notion allows us to consider weights to moderate the importance of different groups of variables, and additionally volume measures different from the Lebesgue measure as well as classes of test sets different from measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces. \r\rWe relate the weighted geometric L2-discrepancy to numerical integration defined over weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and settle in this way an open problem posed by Novak and Wo´zniakowski. \r\rFurthermore, we prove an upper bound for the numerical integration error for cubature formulas that use admissible sample points. The set of admissible sample points may actually be a subset of the integration domain of measure zero. We illustrate that particularly in infinite dimensional numerical integration it is crucial to distinguish between the whole integration domain and the set of those sample points that actually can be used by algorithms.

Keromytis                    2010-12-22                    We present a comprehensive survey of Voice over IP security academic research, using a set of 245 publications forming a closed cross-citation set. We classify these papers according to an extended version of the VoIP Security Alliance (VoIPSA) Threat Taxonomy. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for researchers seeking to understand existing capabilities and to identify gaps in addressing the numerous threats and vulner- abilities present in VoIP systems. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to vulnerabilities reported in a variety of VoIP products.\r\rWe identify two specific problem areas (denial of service, and service abuse) as requiring significant more attention from the research community. We also find that the overwhelming majority of the surveyed work takes a black box view of VoIP systems that avoids examining their internal structure and implementation. Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations. Finally, we argue for further work on understanding cross-protocol and cross-mechanism vulnerabilities (emergent properties), which are the byproduct of a highly complex system-of-systems and an indication of the issues in future large-scale systems.

Stolfo                    2010-12-13                    Masquerade attacks are a common security problem\rthat is a consequence of identity theft. Masquerade detection may\rserve as a means of building more secure and dependable systems\rthat authenticate legitimate users by their behavior. Prior work\rhas focused on user command modeling to identify abnormal\rbehavior indicative of impersonation. This paper extends prior\rwork by modeling user search behavior to detect deviations indicating\ra masquerade attack. We hypothesize that each individual\ruser knows their own file system well enough to search in a\rlimited, targeted and unique fashion in order to find information\rgermane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other\rhand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another\ruserï¿½s desktop, and would likely search more extensively and\rbroadly in a manner that is different than the victim user being\rimpersonated. We devise a taxonomy of Windows applications\rand user commands that are used to abstract sequences of\ruser actions and identify actions linked to search activities. The\rexperimental results show that modeling search behavior reliably\rdetects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of\r1.1%, far better than prior published results. The limited set of\rfeatures used for search behavior modeling also results in large\rperformance gains over the same modeling techniques that use\rlarger sets of features.

Social\rComputing research focuses on online social behavior and using\rartifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other\ruseful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and\rknowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy,\rwhich is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as\rregulated differently in different locales. But clever technical\rsolutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs,\re.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing,\ranother major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting\rresearch area, \\emph{Societal Computing}, that focuses on the\rtechnical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains\rthat raise significant societal issues.  We highlight some of the\rrelevant research topics and open problems that we foresee in Societal\rComputing.\rWe feel that\rthese topics, and Societal Computing in general, need to gain prominence\ras they will provide useful avenues of research leading to\rincreasing benefits for society as a whole.

Previously, metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in detecting defects, even without an oracle. In metamorphic testing, the application's ``metamorphic properties'' are used to modify existing test case input to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the new output can easily be computed based on the original output. If the new output is not as expected, then a defect must exist. In practice, however, metamorphic testing can be a manually intensive technique for all but the simplest cases. The transformation of input data can be laborious for large data sets, and errors can occur in comparing the outputs when they are very complex. In this paper, we present a tool called Amsterdam that automates metamorphic testing by allowing the tester to easily set up and conduct metamorphic tests with little manual intervention, merely by specifying the properties to check, configuring the framework, and running the software. Additionally, we describe an approach called Heuristic Metamorphic Testing, which addresses issues related to false positives and non-determinism, and we present the results of new empirical studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of metamorphic testing techniques at detecting defects in real-world programs without test oracles.

Worse, the number of races in deployed applications\rmay drastically increase due to the rise of multicore\rhardware and the immaturity of current race detectors.\r\rLOOM is a “live-workaround” system designed to\rquickly and safely bypass application races at runtime.\rLOOM provides a flexible and safe language for developers\rto write execution filters that explicitly synchronize\rcode. It then uses an evacuation algorithm to safely install\rthe filters to live applications to avoid races. It reduces\rits performance overhead using hybrid instrumen-\rtation that combines static and dynamic instrumentation.\r\rWe evaluated LOOM on nine real races from a diverse\rset of six applications, including MySQL and Apache.\rOur results show that (1) LOOM can safely fix all evaluated\rraces in a timely manner, thereby increasing application\ravailability; (2) LOOM incurs little performance\roverhead; (3) LOOM scales well with the number of application\rthreads; and (4) LOOM is easy to use.

Therefore, benchmarks are created to both evaluate and compare the scanners. Unfortunately, most existing benchmarks suffer from various drawbacks, often by testing against inappropriate criteria that does not reflect the user's needs. To deal with this problem, we present an approach called Baseline that coaches the user in picking the minimal set of weaknesses (i.e., a baseline) that a qualified scanner should be able to detect and also helps the user evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scanner in detecting those chosen weaknesses. Baseline's goal is not to serve as a generic ranking system for web vulnerability scanners, but instead to help users choose the most appropriate scanner for their specific needs.

Werschulz, Henryk Wozniakowski                    2010-09-21                    We study the tractability of computing $\\varepsilon$-approximations of the\rFredholm problem of the second kind: given $f\\in F_d$ and $q\\in Q_{2d}$,\rfind $u\\in L_2(I^d)$ satisfying\r\\[                                                                              \r  u(x) - \\int_{I^d} q(x,y)u(y)\\,dy = f(x)                                       \r  \\qquad\\forall\\,x\\in I^d=[0,1]^d.                                              \r\\]\rHere, $F_d$ and $Q_{2d}$ are spaces of $d$-variate right hand functions and\r$2d$-variate kernels that are continuously embedded in~$L_2(I^d)$\rand~$L_2(I^{2d})$, respectively. We consider the worst case setting, measuring\rthe approximation error for the solution $u$ in the $L_2(I^d)$-sense.  We say\rthat a problem is tractable if the minimal number of information operations\rof $f$ and $q$ needed to obtain an $\\varepsilon$-approximation is\rsub-exponential in $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and~$d$. One information operation\rcorresponds to the evaluation of one linear functional or one function\rvalue. The lack of sub-exponential behavior may be defined in various ways,\rand so we have various kinds of tractability.  In particular, the problem\ris strongly polynomially tractable if the minimal number of information\roperations is bounded by a polynomial in $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ for all~$d$.\r\rWe show that tractability (of any kind whatsoever) for the Fredholm problem\ris equivalent to tractability of the $L_2$-approximation problems over the\rspaces of right-hand sides and kernel functions.  So (for example) if both\rthese approximation problems are strongly polynomially tractable, so is the\rFredholm problem.  In general, the upper bound provided by this proof is\ressentially non-constructive, since it involves an interpolatory algorithm\rthat exactly solves the Fredholm problem (albeit for finite-rank\rapproximations of~$f$ and~$q$).  However, if linear functionals are\rpermissible and that $F_d$ and~$Q_{2d}$ are tensor product spaces, we are\rable to surmount this obstacle; that is, we provide a fully-constructive\ralgorithm that provides an approximation with nearly-optimal cost, i.e.,\rone whose cost is within a factor $\\ln\\,\\varepsilon^{-1}$ of being optimal.

However, existing solutions have inherent\rinefficiency that raises questions of practicality.\rHere, we step back from the goal of achieving maximal privacy\rguarantees in an encrypted search scenario to consider efficiency as\ra priority. We propose a privacy\rframework for search that allows tuning and optimization of the\rtrade-offs between privacy and efficiency.\rAs an instantiation of\rthe privacy framework we introduce a tunable search system based on\rthe SADS scheme and provide detailed measurements demonstrating the\rtrade-offs of the constructed system. We also analyze other existing\rencrypted search schemes with respect to this framework. We further\rpropose a protocol that addresses the challenge of document content \rretrieval in a search setting with relaxed privacy requirements.

Bellovin                    2010-07-12                    The IPsec protocol promised easy, ubiquitous encryption.  That has never happened.  For the most part, IPsec usage is confined to VPNs for road warriors, largely due to needless configuration complexity and incompatible implementations. We have designed a simple VPN configuration language that hides the unwanted complexities.  Virtually no options are necessary or possible.  The administrator specifies the absolute minimum of information: the authorized hosts, their operating systems, and a little about the network topology; everything else, including certificate generation, is automatic. Our implementation includes a multitarget compiler, which generates implementation-specific configuration files for three different platforms; others are easy to add.

The functions we want to integrate\rare from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is endowed with \ra weighted norm. \rWe study the worst case $\\epsilon$-complexity which\ris defined as the minimal cost among all algorithms whose worst\rcase error over the Hilbert space unit ball is at most $\\epsilon$.\rHere we assume that the\rcost of evaluating a function depends polynomially on the number\rof active variables.\r\rThe infinite-dimensional integration problem is (polynomially) \rtractable if the\r$\\epsilon$-complexity is bounded by a constant times a power of \r$1/\\epsilon$. The smallest such power is called the exponent of \rtractability. \r\rFirst we study finite-order weights. We provide improved lower\rbounds for the exponent of tractability for general finite-order weights\rand improved upper bounds for three newly defined classes\rof finite-order weights. \rThe constructive upper bounds are obtained by multilevel algorithms\rthat use for each level quasi-Monte Carlo integration points whose\rprojections onto specific sets of coordinates exhibit a small \rdiscrepancy. \r\rThe newly defined finite-intersection weights model the situation where\reach group of variables interacts with at most $\\rho$ other groups \rof variables, where $\\rho$ is some fixed number.  \rFor these weights we obtain a sharp upper bound. This is the\rfirst class of weights for which the exact exponent of tractability\ris known for any possible decay of the weights and for any polynomial\rdegree of the cost function. For  the other two classes of finite-order\rweights our upper bounds are sharp if, e.g., \rthe decay of the \rweights\ris fast or slow enough.\r\rWe extend our analysis to the case of arbitrary weights.\rIn particular, from our results for finite-order\rweights, we conclude a lower bound on the exponent \rof tractability for arbitrary weights and a constructive upper bound for \rproduct weights. \r\rAlthough we confine ourselves for simplicity to \rexplicit upper bounds for four classes of \rweights, we stress that our multilevel algorithm together with our\rdefault choice of quasi-Monte Carlo points \ris applicable to any class of weights.

One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing that feeds randomly generated inputs to the software and witnesses its failures. However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks \"security invariants'' that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability. We discuss the approach and introduce a prototype framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzing testing framework) implementation. We also present the results of case studies that demonstrate the approach's feasibility and evaluate its performance.

Prior work has focused on user command\rmodeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. This\rpaper extends prior work by modeling user search behavior to detect\rdeviations indicating a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that each\rindividual user knows their own le system well enough to search in a\rlimited, targeted and unique fashion in order to nd information germane\rto their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely\rnot know the le system and layout of another user's desktop, and would\rlikely search more extensively and broadly in a manner that is dierent\rthan the victim user being impersonated. We extend prior research by\rdevising taxonomies of UNIX commands and Windows applications that\rare used to abstract sequences of user commands and actions. The experimental\rresults show that modeling search behavior reliably detects\rall masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 0.13%, far better\rthan prior published results. The limited set of features used for search\rbehavior modeling also results in large performance gains over the same\rmodeling techniques that use larger sets of features.

Most research on recommender systems has focused on recommendation algorithms. There has been relatively little research, however, in the area of generalized system architectures for recommendation systems. In this paper, we introduce weHelp - a reference architecture for social recommender systems. Our architecture is designed to be application and domain agnostic, but we briefly discuss here how it applies to recommender systems for software engineering.

Chiang                    2010-05-11                    Electronic health record (EHR) systems have significant potential advantages over traditional paper-based systems, but they require that providers assume responsibility for data entry. One significant barrier to adoption of EHRs is the perception of slowed data-entry by providers. This study compares the speed of data-entry using computer-based templates vs. paper for a large eye clinic, using 10 subjects and 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Dataentry into the EHR was significantly slower (p<0.01) than traditional paper forms.

In this paper, we describe our implementation of a generic\rmutation testing framework and the results of applying three\rsets of concurrency mutation operators on four example Java\rprograms through empirical study and analysis.

In some cases, it may be impossible to know the program's correct output a priori; in other cases, the creation of an oracle may simply be too hard. These applications typically fall into a category of software that Weyuker describes as \"Programs which were written in order to determine the answer in the first place. There would be no need to write such programs, if the correct answer were known.\" The absence of a test oracle clearly presents a challenge when it comes to detecting subtle errors, faults, defects or anomalies in software in these domains.  \r\rWithout a test oracle, it is impossible to know in general what the expected output should be for a given input, but it may be possible to predict how changes to the input should effect changes in the output, and thus identify expected relations among a set of inputs and among the set of their respective outputs. This approach, introduced by Chen et al., is known as \"metamorphic testing\". In metamorphic testing, if test case input x produces an output f(x), the function's so-called \"metamorphic properties\" can then be used to guide the creation of a transformation function t, which can then be applied to the input to produce t(x); this transformation then allows us to predict the expected output f(t(x)), based on the (already known) value of f(x). If the new output is as expected, it is not necessarily right, but any violation of the property indicates a defect. That is, though it may not be possible to know whether an output is correct, we can at least tell whether an output is incorrect.\r\rThis thesis investigates three hypotheses. First, I claim that an automated approach to metamorphic testing will advance the state of the art in detecting defects in programs without test oracles, particularly in the domains of machine learning, simulation, and optimization. To demonstrate this, I describe a tool for test automation, and present the results of new empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of metamorphic testing to that of other techniques for testing applications that do not have an oracle. Second, I suggest that conducting function-level metamorphic testing in the context of a running application will reveal defects not found by metamorphic testing using system-level properties alone, and introduce and evaluate a new testing technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking. Third, I hypothesize that it is feasible to continue this type of testing in the deployment environment (i.e., after the software is released), with minimal impact on the user, and describe a generalized approach called In Vivo Testing. \r\rAdditionally, this thesis presents guidelines for identifying metamorphic properties, explains how metamorphic testing fits into the software development process, and discusses suggestions for both practitioners and researchers who need to test software without the help of a test oracle.

Contact models should robustly handle contact between geometry by preventing interpenetrations. This should be accomplished while respecting natural laws in order to maintain physical correctness. We simultaneously desire to achieve these criteria as efficiently as possible to minimize simulation runtimes. Many methods exist that partially achieve these properties, but none yet fully attain all three. This thesis investigates existing methodologies with respect to these attributes, and proposes a novel algorithm for the simulation of deformable materials that demonstrate them all. This new method is analyzed and optimized, paving the way for future work in this simplified but powerful manner of simulation.

Strong authentication and accountability are key tools for dealing with online attacks, and we would like to realize them through a token-based, centralized identity management system. In this report, we present aprivacy-preserving group of protocols comprising a unique per user digital identity card, with which its owner is able to authenticate himself, prove possession of attributes, register himself to multiple online organizations  (anonymously or not) and provide proof of membership.  Unlike\rexisting credential-based identity management systems, this card is revocable, i.e., its legal owner may invalidate it if physically lost, and still recover its content and registrations into a new credential. \rThis card will protect an honest individual's anonymity when applicable as well as ensure his activity is known only to appropriate users.

Polynomial tractability means that the solution \rof a d-variate problem can be solved to within $\\varepsilon$ with \rpolynomial cost in $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and d. Unfortunately, many\rmultivariate problems are not polynomially tractable. \rThis holds for all non-trivial unweighted linear tensor product problems.\rBy an unweighted problem we mean the case when all variables and\rgroups of variables play the same role. \r\rIt seems natural to ask what is the\r``smallest'' non-exponential function $T:[1,\\infty)\\times\r[1,\\infty)\\to[1,\\infty)$ for which we have\rT-tractability of unweighted linear tensor product problems. That is, when\rthe cost of a multivariate problem can be bounded \rby a multiple of a power of $T(\\varepsilon^{-1},d)$. \rUnder natural assumptions, it turns out that this function is\r$T^{qpol}(x,y):=\\exp((1+\\ln\\,x)(1+\\ln y))$\rfor all $x,y\\in[1,\\infty)$.\rThe function $T^{qpol}$ goes to infinity faster than any\rpolynomial although not ``much'' faster, and that is why we refer to \r$T^{qpol}$-tractability as quasi-polynomial tractability.\r\rThe main purpose of this paper is to promote quasi-polynomial\rtractability especially for the study of unweighted multivariate problems.\rWe do this for the worst case and randomized settings and for\ralgorithms using arbitrary linear functionals or only function values. \rWe prove relations between quasi-polynomial tractability \rin these two settings and for the two classes of algorithms.

Stolfo                    2010-04-09                    We introduce BotSwindler, a bait injection system designed to delude and detect crimeware by forcing it to reveal itself during the exploitation of monitored information. Our implementation of BotSwindler relies upon an out-of-host software agent to drive user-like interactions in a virtual machine, seeking to convince malware residing within the guest OS that it has captured legitimate credentials. To aid in the accuracy and realism of the simulations, we introduce a low overhead approach, called virtual machine verification, for verifying whether the guest OS is in one of a predefined set of states. We provide empirical evidence to show that BotSwindler can be used to induce malware into performing observable actions and demonstrate how this approach is superior to that used in other tools. We present results from a user study to illustrate the believability of the simulations and show that financial bait information can be used to effectively detect compromises through experimentation with real credential-collecting malware.

Purchases made from a single bank account can be linked to each other by many parties. This could be addressed in a straight-forward way by generating unlinkable credentials from a single master credential using\rCamenisch and Lysyanskaya's algorithm; however, if bank accounts are\rtaxable, some report must be made to the tax authority about each account. Using unlinkable credentials, digital cash, and zero knowledge proofs of knowledge, we present a solution that prevents anyone, even the tax authority, from knowing which accounts belong to which users, or from being able to link any account to another or to purchases or deposits.

However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks \"security invariants'' that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability. We discuss the approach and introduce a prototype framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzing testing framework) for implementation. We also present the results of case studies that demonstrate the approach's feasibility and evaluate its performance.

A common approach to testing such applications has been to use a \"pseudo-oracle\", in which multiple independently-developed implementations of an algorithm process an input and the results are compared. Other approaches include the use of\rprogram invariants, formal specification languages, trace and log file analysis, and metamorphic testing.\r\rIn this paper, we present the results of two empirical studies in which we compare the effectiveness of some of these approaches, including metamorphic testing, pseudo-oracles, and runtime assertion checking. We also analyze the results in terms of the software development process, and discuss suggestions for practitioners and researchers who need to test software without a test oracle.

One proposed way of addressing this problem has been to continue testing and analysis of the application in the field, after it has been deployed. The theory behind this \"perpetual testing\" approach is that over time, defects will reveal themselves given that multiple instances of the same application may be run globally with different configurations, in different environments, under different patterns of usage, and in different system states.\r\rA practical limitation of many automated approaches to deployment environment testing and analysis is the potentially high performance overhead incurred by the necessary instrumentation. However, it may be possible to reduce this overhead by selecting test cases and performing analysis only in previously-unseen application states, thus reducing the number of redundant tests and analyses that are run. Solutions for fault detection, model checking, security testing, and fault localization in deployed software may all benefit from a technique that ignores application states that have already been tested or explored.\r\rIn this paper, we apply such a technique to a testing methodology called \"In Vivo Testing\", which conducts tests in deployed applications, and present a solution that ensures that tests are only executed in states that the application has not previously encountered. In addition to discussing our implementation, we present the results of an empirical study that demonstrates its effectiveness, and explain how the new approach can be generalized to assist other automated testing and analysis techniques.

K. Ho, Christian Murphy, Gail Kaiser, Baowen Xu, Tsong Yueh Chen                    2010-01-11                    Machine Learning algorithms have provided important core functionality to support solutions in many scientific computing applications - such as computational biology, computational linguistics, and others. However, it is difficult to test such applications because often there is no \"test oracle\" to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. To help address the quality of scientific computing software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called \"metamorphic testing\", which has been shown to be effective in such cases. Also presented is a case study on a real-world machine learning application framework, and a discussion of how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study. We also conduct mutation analysis and cross-validation, which reveal that our method has very high effectiveness in killing mutants, and that observing expected cross-validation result alone is not sufficient to test for the correctness of a supervised classification program. Metamorphic testing is strongly recommended as a complementary approach. Finally we discuss how our findings can be used in other areas of computational science and engineering.

It is thus imperative to develop communication tools and applications that work well in opportunistic networks. In particular, group chat and instant messaging applications are particularly lacking for such opportunistic networks today.\r\rIn this paper, we present ONEChat, a group chat and instant messaging program that works in such opportunistic networks. ONEChat uses message multicasting on top of service discovery protocols in order to support group chat and reduce bandwidth consumption in opportunistic networks. ONEChat does not require any pre-configuration, a fixed network infrastructure or a client-server architecture in order to operate. In addition, it supports features such as group chat, private rooms, line-by-line or character-by-character messaging, file transfer, etc.\r\rWe also present our quantitative analysis of ONEChat, which we believe indicates that the ONEChat architecture is an efficient group collaboration platform for opportunistic networks.

Carloni                    2009-12-10                    We present a throughput-driven partitioning and a\rthroughput-preserving merging algorithm for the high-level physical\rsynthesis of latency-insensitive (LI) systems.  These two algorithms\rare integrated along with a published floorplanner in a\rnew iterative physical synthesis flow to optimize system throughput\rand reduce area occupation.  The synthesis flow iterates a\rfloorplanning-partitioning-floorplanning-merging sequence of\roperations to improve the system topology and the physical locations\rof cores.  The partitioning algorithm performs bottom-up clustering of\rthe internal logic of a given IP core to divide it into smaller ones,\reach of which has no combinational path from input to output and thus\ris legal for LI-interface encapsulation.  Applying this algorithm to\rcores on critical feedback loops optimizes their length and in turn\renables throughput optimization via the subsequent floorplanning.\rThe merging algorithm reduces the number of cores on non-critical\rloops, lowering the overall area taken by LI interfaces without\rhurting the system throughput.  Experimental results on a large\rsystem-on-chip design show a 16.7% speedup in system throughput and\ra 2.1% reduction in area occupation.

Kaiser                    2009-12-08                    Many software security vulnerabilities only reveal themselves under certain conditions, i.e., particular configurations of the software and certain inputs together with its particular runtime environment. One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing, which feeds a range of randomly modified inputs to a software application while monitoring it for failures. However, typical fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, in this proposal we present a new testing methodology called Configuration Fuzzing. Configuration Fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is mutated at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks \"security invariants\" that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability; however, the fuzzing is performed in a duplicated copy of the original process, so that it does not affect the state of the running application. Configuration Fuzzing uses a covering array algorithm when fuzzing the configuration which guarantees a certain degree of coverage of the configuration space in the lifetime of the program-under-test. In addition, Configuration Fuzzing tests that are run after the software is released ensure representative real-world user inputs to test with. In addition to discussing the approach and describing a prototype framework for implementation, we also present the results of case studies to prove the approach's feasibility and evaluate its performance.\r\rIn this thesis, we will continue developing the framework called ConFu (CONfiguration FUzzi ng framework) that supports the generation of test functions, parallel sandboxed execution and vulnerability detection. Given the initial ConFu, we will optimize the way that configurations get mutated, define more security invariants and conduct additional empirical studies of ConFu's effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities.\r\rAt the conclusion of this work, we want to prove that ConFu is efficient and effective in detecting common vulnerabilities and tests executed by ConFu can ensure reasonable degree of coverage of both the configuration and user input space in the lifetime of the software.

Toward addressing this problem, we present Transplay, a system that captures application software bugs as they occur in production and deterministically reproduces them in a completely different environment, potentially running a different operating system, where the application, its binaries and other support data do not exist. Transplay introduces partial checkpointing, a new mechanism that provides two key properties. It efficiently captures the minimal state necessary to reexecute just the last few moments of the application before it encountered a failure. The recorded state, which typically consists of a few megabytes of data, is used to replay the application without requiring the specific application binaries or the original execution environment. Transplay integrates with existing debuggers to provide facilities such as breakpoints and single-stepping to allow the user to examine the contents of variables and other program state at each source line of the application’s replayed execution. We have implemented a Transplay prototype that can record unmodified Linux applications and replay them on different versions of Linux as well as Windows. Experiments with server applications such as the Apache web server show that Transplay can be used in production with modest recording overhead.

Yet virtually all existing SIP overload control work is focused on SIP-over-UDP, despite the fact that TCP is increasingly seen as the more viable choice of SIP transport. This paper answers the following questions: is the existing TCP flow control capable of handling the SIP overload problem? If not, why and how can we make it work? We provide a comprehensive explanation of the default SIP-over-TCP overload behavior through server instrumentation. We also propose and implement novel but\rsimple overload control algorithms without any kernel or protocol level modification. Experimental evaluation shows that with our mechanism the overload performance improves from its original zero throughput to nearly full capacity. Our work also leads to the important high level insight that the traditional notion of TCP flow control alone is incapable of managing overload for time-critical session based applications, which would be applicable not only to SIP, but also to\ra wide range of other common applications such as database servers.

This architecture aims to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic. Towards this goal, PBS takes a hybrid approach: a proactive approach of explicit permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering attacks. On-path signaling is used to configure the permission state stored in routers for a data flow. The signaling approach enables easy installation and management of the permission state, and its use of soft-state improves robustness of the system. For secure permission state setup, PBS provides security for signaling in two ways: signaling messages are encrypted end-to-end using public key encryption and TLS provides hop-by-hop encryption of signaling paths.\rIn addition, PBS uses IPsec for data packet authentication. Our analysis and performance evaluation show that PBS is an effective and scalable solution for preventing various kinds of attack scenarios, including Byzantine attacks.

Unfortunately, being profile-based, online advertising methods violate consumers' privacy, which has engendered resistance to the ads. However, protecting privacy\rthrough anonymity seems to encourage click-fraud. In this paper, we define consumer's privacy and present a privacy-preserving, targeted ad system (PPOAd) which is resistant towards click fraud. Our scheme is structured to provide financial incentives to to all entities involved.

Personals and Trulia.com users define structured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches.  Typically, profiles are evaluated against large datasets and\rproduce thousands of matches. In addition to filtering, users also specify ranking in their profile, and matches are returned in the form\rof a ranked list. Top results in ranked lists are typically homogeneous, which hinders data exploration. For example, a user\rlooking for 1- or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a\rlarge number of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before\rseeing any apartment with different characteristics. An alternative to\rranking is to group matches on common attribute values (e.g., cheap\r1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods, 2-bedrooms with 2 baths). However,\rnot all groups will be of interest to the user given the ranking\rcriteria.\r\rWe argue here that neither single-list ranking nor attribute-based\rgrouping is adequate for effective exploration of ranked datasets. We\rformalize rank-aware clustering and develop a novel rank-aware\rbottom-up subspace clustering algorithm. We evaluate the performance\rof our algorithm over large datasets from a leading online dating\rsite, and present an experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.

Metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in addressing the quality assurance of these \"non-testable programs\". In metamorphic testing, if test input x produces output f(x), specified \"metamorphic properties\" are used to create a transformation function t, which can be applied to the input to produce t(x); this transformation then allows the output f(t(x)) to be predicted based on the already-known value of f(x). If the output is not as expected, then a defect must exist.\r\rPreviously we investigated the effectiveness of testing based on metamorphic properties of the entire application. Here, we improve upon that work by presenting a new technique called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, a testing approach that automatically conducts metamorphic testing of individual functions during the program's execution. We also describe an implementation framework called Columbus, and discuss the results of empirical studies that demonstrate that checking the metamorphic properties of individual functions increases the effectiveness of the approach in detecting defects, with minimal performance impact.

One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing, which feeds a range of randomly modified inputs to a software application while monitoring it for failures. However, fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of how much of the input space will be explored. To address these problems, in this paper we present a new testing methodology called configuration fuzzing. Configuration fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is randomly modified at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continuously fuzzes the configuration and checks \"security invariants\" that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability; however, the fuzzing is performed in a duplicated copy of the original process, so that it does not affect the state of the running application. In addition to discussing the approach and describing a prototype framework for implementation, we also present the results of a case study to demonstrate the approach’s efficiency.

This is achieved by merging Sequential Analysis and Online Learning. \rMany online algorithms use the example's margin to decide whether the model should be updated. Usually, the algorithm's model is updated when the margin is smaller than a certain threshold. The evaluation of the margin for each example requires the algorithm to evaluate all the model's features. Sequential Analysis allows us to early stop the computation of the margin when uninformative examples are encountered. It is desirable to save computation on uninformative examples since they will have very little impact on the final model.\rWe show the successful speedup of Online Boosting while maintaining accuracy on a synthetic and the MNIST data sets.

Patel, Stephen A. Edwards                    2009-09-03                    Hard real-time systems use worst-case execution\rtime (WCET) estimates to ensure that timing requirements\rare met. The typical approach for obtaining WCET estimates\ris to employ static program analysis methods. While these\rapproaches provide WCET bounds, they struggle to analyze\rprograms with loops whose iteration counts depend on input data.\rSuch programs mandate user-guided annotations. We propose a\rhybrid approach by augmenting static program analysis with\rmodel-checking to analyze such programs and derive the loop\rbounds automatically. In addition, we use model-checking to\rguarantee repeatable timing behaviors from segments of program\rcode. Our target platform is a precision timed architecture: a\rSPARC-based architecture promising predictable and repeatable\rtiming behaviors. We use CBMC and illustrate our approach\ron Euclidean greatest common divisor algorithm (for WCET\ranalysis) and a VGA controller (for repeatable timing validation).

Prabhu, Yingbo Song, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2009-08-31                    Recent work on the analysis of polymorphic shellcode engines suggests that modern obfuscation methods would soon eliminate the usefulness of signature-based network intrusion detection methods and supports growing views that the new generation of shellcode cannot be accurately and efficiently represented by the string signatures which current IDS and AV scanners rely upon. In this paper, we expand on this area of study by demonstrating never before seen concepts in advanced shellcode polymorphism with a proof-of-concept engine which we call Hydra. Hydra distinguishes itself by integrating an array of obfuscation techniques, such as recursive NOP sleds and multi-layer ciphering into one system while offering multiple improvements upon existing strategies. We also introduce never before seen attack methods such as byte-splicing statistical mimicry, safe-returns with forking shellcode and syscall-time-locking. In total, Hydra simultaneously attacks signature, statistical, disassembly, behavioral and emulation-based sensors, as well as frustrates of&#64258;ine forensics. This engine was developed to present an updated view of the frontier of modern polymorphic shellcode and provide an effective tool for evaluation of IDS systems, Cyber test ranges and other related security technologies.

Lee                    2009-08-13                    A longstanding lacuna in the field of computational learning theory is the learnability of succinctly representable monotone Boolean functions, i.e., functions that preserve the given order of the input. This thesis makes significant progress towards understanding both the\rpossibilities and the limitations of learning various classes of monotone functions by carefully considering the complexity measures used to evaluate them.\r\rWe show that Boolean functions computed by polynomial-size monotone circuits are hard to learn assuming the existence of one-way functions. Having shown the hardness of learning general polynomial-size monotone circuits, we show that the class of Boolean functions computed by polynomial-size depth-3 monotone circuits are hard to learn using statistical queries. As a counterpoint, we give a statistical query learning algorithm that can learn random polynomial-size depth-2 monotone circuits (i.e., monotone DNF formulas).\r\rAs a preliminary step towards a fully polynomial-time, proper learning algorithm for learning polynomial-size monotone decision trees, we also show the relationship between the average depth of a monotone decision tree, its average sensitivity, and its variance.\r\rFinally, we return to monotone DNF formulas, and we show that they are teachable (a different model of learning) in the average case. We also show that non-monotone DNF formulas, juntas, and sparse GF2 formulas are teachable in the average case.

To address this problem, we present Apiary, a system that provides transparent application fault containment while retaining the ease of use of a traditional integrated desktop environment. Apiary accomplishes this with three key mechanisms. It isolates applications in containers that integrate in a controlled manner at the display and file system. It introduces ephemeral containers that are quickly instantiated for single application execution and then removed, to prevent any exploit that occurs from persisting and to protect user privacy. It introduces the virtual layered file system to make instantiating containers fast and space efficient, and to make managing many containers no more complex than having a single traditional desktop. We have implemented Apiary on Linux without any application or operating system kernel changes. Our results from running real applications, known exploits, and a 24-person user study show that Apiary has modest performance overhead, is effective in limiting the damage from real vulnerabilities to enable quick recovery, and is as easy to use as a traditional desktop while improving desktop computer security and privacy.

Bellovin                    2009-07-26                    Traditional firewalls have the ability to allow or block traffic based on source address as well as destination address and port number. Our original ROFL scheme implements firewalling by layering it on top of routing; however, the original proposal focused just on destination address and port number.  Doing route selection based in part on source addresses is a form of policy routing, which has started to receive increased amounts of attention.  In this paper, we extend the original ROFL (ROuting as the Firewall Layer) scheme by including source prefix constraints in route announcement.  We present algorithms for route propagation and packet forwarding, and demonstrate the correctness of these algorithms using rigorous proofs.  The new scheme not only accomplishes the complete set of filtering functionality provided by traditional firewalls, but also introduces a new direction for policy routing.

We then propose an efficient adaptive ranking\rmechanism for each of the families.  We also describe a\rtwo-dimensional Skyline-based visualization that can be used in\rconjunction with the ranking to further improve the user's interaction\rwith the system, and demonstrate how such Skylines can be computed\radaptively and efficiently.

The corner cases of software failure during execution\roften slip through the traditional software checking.\rIf the software checking infrastructure supports the\rtransparent checkpoint and resume of the live application\rstates, the checking system can preserve and replay the live\rstates in which the software failures occur. We introduce\ra novel software checking framework that enables application\rstates including program behaviors and execution\rcontexts to be cloned and resumed on a computing cloud.\rIt employs (1) EXPLODE’s model checking engine for a\rlightweight and general purpose software checking (2) ZAP\rsystem for faster, low overhead and transparent checkpoint\rand resume mechanism through virtualized PODs (PrOcess\rDomains), which is a collection of host-independent processes,\rand (3) scalable and distributed checking infrastructure\rbased on Distributed EXPLODE. Efficient and portable\rcheckpoint/resume and replay mechanism employed in this\rframework enables scalable software checking in order to\rimprove the reliability of software products.

This limitation stems\rfrom the poor performance of P2P when the number of peers sharing the content is small. In this paper, we propose a new provider-managed P2P VoD framework for efficient delivery of niche content based on two principles: reserving small portions of peers' storage and upload resources, as well as using novel, weighed caching techniques. We demonstrate through analytical analysis, simulations, and experiments on planetlab that our architecture can provide high streaming quality for niche content. In particular, we show that our architecture increases the catalog size by up to $40\\%$ compared to standard P2P VoD systems, and that a weighted cache policy can reduce the startup delay for niche content by a factor of more than three.

We propose flexible filters as a technique that combines static mapping of the stream program tasks with dynamic load balancing of their execution. The goal is to improve the system-level processing throughput of the program when it is executed on a distributed-memory multi-core system as well as the local (core-level) memory utilization. Our technique is distributed and scalable because it is based on point-to-point handshake signals exchanged between neighboring cores. Load balancing with flexible filters can be applied to stream applications that present large dynamic variations in the computational load of their tasks and the dimension of the stream data tokens. In order to demonstrate the practicality of our technique, we present the performance improvements for the case study of a JPEG encoder running\ron the IBM Cell multi-core processor.

Locasto, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2009-06-11                    The deployment and use of Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors often requires the intervention of a human expert to manually calibrate and optimize their performance. Depending on the site and the type of traffic it receives, the operators might have to provide recent and sanitized training data sets, the characteristics of expected traffic (i.e. outlier ratio), and exceptions or even expected future modifications of system’s behavior. In this paper, we study the potential performance issues that stem from fully automating the AD sensors’ day-to-day maintenance and calibration. Our goal is to remove the dependence on human operator using an unlabeled, and thus potentially dirty, sample of incoming traffic. To that end, we propose to enhance the training phase of AD sensors with a self-calibration phase, leading to the automatic determination of the optimal AD parameters. We show how this novel calibration phase can be employed in conjunction with previously proposed methods for training data sanitization resulting in a fully automated AD maintenance cycle. Our approach is completely agnostic to the underlying AD sensor algorithm. Furthermore, the self-calibration can be applied in an online fashion to ensure that the resulting AD models reflect changes in the system’s behavior which would otherwise render the sensor’s internal state inconsistent. We verify the validity of our approach through a series of experiments where we compare the manually obtained optimal parameters with the ones computed from the self-calibration phase. Modeling traffic from two different sources, the fully automated calibration shows a 7.08% reduction in detection\rrate and a 0.06% increase in false positives, in the worst case, when compared to the optimal selection of parameters. Finally, our adaptive models outperform the statically generated ones retaining the gains in performance from the sanitization process over time.

Stolfo                    2009-06-10                    Masquerade attacks are unfortunately a familiar security problem that is a consequence of\ridentity theft. Detecting masqueraders is very hard. Prior work has focused on user command\rmodeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. This paper extends prior\rwork by presenting one-class Hellinger distance-based and one-class SVM modeling techniques\rthat use a set of novel features to reveal user intent. The specic objective is to model user\rsearch proles and detect deviations indicating a masquerade attack. We hypothesize that\reach individual user knows their own le system well enough to search in a limited, targeted\rand unique fashion in order to nd information germane to their current task. Masqueraders,\ron the other hand, will likely not know the le system and layout of another user's desktop,\rand would likely search more extensively and broadly in a manner that is dierent than the\rvictim user being impersonated. We extend prior research that uses UNIX command sequences\rissued by users as the audit source by relying upon an abstraction of commands. We devise\rtaxonomies of UNIX commands and Windows applications that are used to abstract sequences\rof user commands and actions. We also gathered our own normal and masquerader data sets\rcaptured in a Windows environment for evaluation. The datasets are publicly available for\rother researchers who wish to study masquerade attack rather than author identication as in\rmuch of the prior reported work. The experimental results show that modeling search behavior\rreliably detects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 0.1%, far better than prior\rpublished results. The limited set of features used for search behavior modeling also results in\rhuge performance gains over the same modeling techniques that use larger sets of features.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Self-monitoring Monitors                                        Salvatore Stolfo, Isaac Greenbaum, Simha Sethumadhavan                    2009-06-03                    Many different monitoring systems have been created to identify system state conditions to detect or prevent a myriad of deliberate attacks, or arbitrary faults inherent in any complex system. Monitoring systems are also vulnerable to attack. A stealthy attacker can simply turn off or disable these monitoring systems without being detected; he would thus be able to perpetrate the very attacks that these systems were designed to stop. For example, many examples of virus attacks against antivirus scanners have appeared in the wild. In this paper, we present a novel technique to “monitor the monitors” in such a way that (a) unauthorized shutdowns of critical monitors are detected with high probability, (b) authorized shutdowns raise no alarm, and (c) the proper shutdown sequence for authorized shutdowns cannot be inferred from reading memory.  The techniques proposed to prevent unauthorized shut down (turning off) of monitoring systems was inspired by the duality of safety technology devised to prevent unauthorized discharge (turning on) of nuclear weapons.

Stolfo                    2009-06-01                    Embedding malcode within documents provides a convenient means of attacking systems. Such attacks can be very targeted and difficult to detect to stop due to the multitude of document-exchange vectors and\rthe vulnerabilities in modern document processing applications. Detecting malcode embedded in a document is difficult owing to the complexity of modern document formats that provide ample opportunity to embed code in a myriad of ways. We focus on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers as a case study in this paper. To detect stealthy embedded malcode in documents, we develop an arbitrary data transformation technique that changes the value of data segments in documents in such a way as to purposely damage any hidden malcode that may be embedded in those sections. Consequently, the embedded malcode will not only fail but also introduce a system exception that would be easily detected. The method is intended to be applied in a safe sandbox, the transformation is reversible after testing a document, and does not require any learning phase. The method depends upon knowledge of the structure of the document binary format to parse a document and identify the specific sectors to which the method can be safely applied for malcode detection. The method can be implemented in MS Word as a security feature to enhance the safety of Word documents.

We evaluate the cost of TLS\rexperimentally using a testbed with OpenSIPS, OpenSSL, and Linux running on an Intel-based server. We analyze TLS costs\rusing application, library, and kernel profiling, and use the profiles to illustrate when and how different costs are incurred, such\ras bulk data encryption, public key encryption, private key decryption, and MAC-based verification. We show that using TLS can reduce performance by up to a factor of 20 compared to the typical case of SIP over UDP. The primary factor in determining performance is whether and how TLS connection establishment is performed, due to the heavy\rcosts of RSA operations used for session negotiation. This depends both on how the SIP proxy is deployed (e.g., as an inbound or\routbound proxy) and what TLS options are used (e.g., mutual authentication, session reuse). The cost of symmetric key operations\rsuch as AES or 3DES, in contrast, tends to be small.\rNetwork operators deploying SIP over TLS should attempt to maximize the persistence of secure connections, and will need\rto assess the server resources required. To aid them, we provide a measurement-driven cost model for use in provisioning SIP\rservers using TLS. Our cost model predicts performance within 15 percent on average.

The\radvice proffered to the programmer is based on the wisdom\rcollected from programmers who have already parallelized\rsome similar code. The utility of COMPASS rests, not only\ron its ability to collect the wisdom unintrusively but also on\rits ability to automatically seek, find and synthesize this wisdom\rinto advice that is tailored to the task at hand, i.e., the\rcode the user is considering parallelizing and the environment\rin which the optimized program is planned to execute.\rCOMPASS provides a platform and an extensible framework\rfor sharing human expertise about code parallelization –\rwidely, and on diverse hardware and software. By leveraging\rthe “wisdom of crowds” model [26], which has been\rconjectured to scale exponentially and which has successfully\rworked for wikis, COMPASS aims to enable rapid propagation\rof knowledge about code parallelization in the context\rof the actual parallelization reengineering, and thus\rcontinue to extend the benefits of Moore’s law scaling to\rscience and society.

Using Cross-Media Relations to Reduce SPIT                                        Kumiko Ono, Henning Schulzrinne                    2009-04-14                    Most legitimate calls are from persons or organizations with\rstrong social ties such as friends. Some legitimate calls, however, are from those with weak social ties such as a restaurant the callee booked a table on-line. Since a callee's contact list usually contains only the addresses of persons or organizations with strong social ties, filtering out unsolicited calls using the contact list is prone to false positives. To reduce these false positives, we first analyzed call logs and identified that legitimate calls are initiated from persons or organizations with weak social ties through transactions over\rthe web or email exchanges. This paper proposes two approaches to label incoming calls by using cross-media relations to previous contact mechanisms which initiate the calls. One approach is that potential callers offer the callee their contact addresses which might be used in future correspondence. Another is that a callee provides potential callers with weakly-secret information that the callers should use in\rfuture correspondence in order to identify them as someone the callee has contacted before through other means. Depending on previous contact mechanisms, the callers use either customized contact addresses or message identifiers. The latter approach enables a callee to label incoming calls even without caller identifiers. Reducing false positives during filtering using our proposed approaches will contribute\rto the reduction in SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony).

Keromytis                    2009-03-30                    The frequency and severity of recent intrusions involving data theft\rand leakages has shown that online users' trust, voluntary or not, in\rthe ability of third parties to protect their sensitive data is often\runfounded.  Data may be exposed anywhere along a corporation's web\rpipeline, from the outward-facing web servers to the back-end\rdatabases.  Additionally, in service-oriented architectures (SOAs),\rdata may also be exposed as they transit between SOAs.  For example,\rcredit card numbers may be leaked during transmission to or handling\rby transaction-clearing intermediaries.\r\rWe present F3ildCrypt, a system that provides end-to-end protection of\rdata across a web pipeline and between SOAs. Sensitive data are\rprotected from their origin (the user's browser) to their legitimate\rfinal destination.  To that end, F3ildCrypt exploits browser scripting\rto enable application- and merchant-aware handling of sensitive data.\rSuch techniques have traditionally been considered a security risk; to\rour knowledge, this is one of the first uses of web scripting that\renhances overall security.  F3ildCrypt uses proxy re-encryption\rto re-target messages as they enter and cross SOA boundaries, and uses\rXACML, the XML-based access control language, to define protection\rpolicies.  Our approach scales well in the number of public key\roperations required for web clients and does not reveal proprietary\rdetails of the logical enterprise network (because of the application\rof proxy re-encryption).  We evaluate F3ildCrypt and show an\radditional cost of 40 to 150 ms when making sensitive transactions\rfrom the web browser, and a processing rate of 100 to 140 XML\rfields/second on the server.  We believe such costs to be a reasonable\rtradeoff for increased sensitive-data confidentiality.

Bowen, Shlomo Hershkop, Angelos D. Keromytis, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2009-03-30                    The insider threat remains one of the most vexing problems in computer security. A number of approaches have been proposed to detect nefarious insider actions including user modeling and profiling techniques, policy and access enforcement techniques, and misuse detection. In this work we propose trap-based defense mechanisms for the case where insiders attempt to exfiltrate and use sensitive information. Our goal is to confuse and confound the attacker requiring far more effort to identify real information from bogus information and to provide a means of detecting when an inside attacker attempts to exploit sensitive information. ``Decoy Documents\" are automatically generated and stored on a file system with the aim of enticing a malicious insider to open and review the contents of the documents. The decoy documents contain several different types of bogus credentials that when used, trigger an alert.  We also embed ``stealthy beacons\" inside the documents that cause a signal to be emitted to a server indicating when and where the particular decoy was opened. We evaluate decoy documents on honeypots penetrated by attackers demonstrating the feasibility of the method.

Recently, metamorphic testing has been shown to be a simple yet effective technique in addressing the quality assurance of these so-called \"non-testable programs\". In metamorphic testing, existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the function should produce an output that can easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x' such that we can predict f(x') based on f(x); if the application does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x') (or both) is wrong.\r\rPreviously we have presented an approach called \"Automated Metamorphic System Testing\", in which metamorphic testing is conducted automatically as the program executes. In the approach, metamorphic properties of the entire application are specified, and then checked after execution is complete. Here, we improve upon that work by presenting a technique in which the metamorphic properties of individual functions are used, allowing for the specification of more complex properties and enabling finer-grained runtime checking. Our goal is to demonstrate that such an approach will be more effective than one based on specifying metamorphic properties at the system level, and is also feasible for use in the deployment environment.\r\rThis technique, called Metamorphic Runtime Checking, is a system testing approach in which the metamorphic properties of individual functions are automatically checked during the program's execution. The tester is able to easily specify the functions' properties so that metamorphic testing can be conducted in a running application, allowing the tests to execute using real input data and in the context of real system states, without affecting those states. We also describe an implementation framework called Columbus, and present the results of empirical studies that demonstrate that checking the metamorphic properties of individual functions increases the effectiveness of the approach in detecting defects, with minimal performance impact.

In particular, the need for users to be able to monitor their own transactions, as well as bank's need to justify its payment requests from cardholders, entitle the latter to maintain a detailed log of all transactions its credit card customers were involved in. A bank can thus build a profile of each cardholder even without the latter's consent. In this technical report, we present a practical and accountable anonymous credit system based on ecash , with a privacy preserving mechanism for error correction and expense-reporting.

Rather, issues such as the\rcoordination of turn exchanges between system and user, or the correct\rgeneration and understanding of words that may convey multiple meanings,\rappear to play an important role in system usability. This thesis\rexplores those two issues in the Columbia Games Corpus, a collection\rof spontaneous task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English.\r\rWe provide evidence of the existence of seven turn-yielding cues --\rprosodic, acoustic and syntactic events strongly associated with\rconversational turn endings -- and show that the likelihood of a\rturn-taking attempt from the interlocutor increases linearly with the\rnumber of cues conjointly displayed by the speaker. We present similar\rresults related to six backchannel-inviting cues -- events that invite\rthe interlocutor to produce a short utterance conveying continued\rattention.\r\rAdditionally, we describe a series of studies of affirmative cue words\r-- a family of cue words such as 'okay' or 'alright' that speakers use\rfrequently in conversation for several purposes: for acknowledging what\rthe interlocutor has said, or for cueing the start of a new topic,\ramong others. We find differences in the acoustic/prosodic realization\rof such functions, but observe that contextual information figures\rprominently in human disambiguation of these words. We also conduct\rmachine learning experiments to explore the automatic classification of\raffirmative cue words. Finally, we examine a novel measure of speaker\rentrainment related to the usage of these words, showing its association\rwith task success and dialogue coordination.

In metamorphic testing, existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f (x), then we create input x' such that we can predict f (x') based on f(x); if the application does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f (x) or f (x') (or both) is wrong. \r\rIn practice, however, metamorphic testing can be a manually intensive technique for all but the simplest cases. The transformation of input data can be laborious for large data sets, or practically impossible for input that is not in human-readable format. Similarly, comparing the outputs can be error-prone for large result sets, especially when slight variations in the results are not actually indicative of errors (i.e., are false positives), for instance when there is non-determinism in the application and multiple outputs can be considered correct.\r\rIn this paper, we present an approach called Automated Metamorphic System Testing. This involves the automation of metamorphic testing at the system level by checking that the metamorphic properties of the entire application hold after its execution. The tester is able to easily set up and conduct metamorphic tests with little manual intervention, and testing can continue in the field with minimal impact\ron the user. Additionally, we present an approach called Heuristic Metamorphic Testing which seeks to reduce false positives and address some cases of non-determinism. We also describe an implementation framework called Amsterdam, and present the results of empirical studies in which we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on real-world programs without test oracles.

Chen                    2009-01-19                    Many applications in the field of scientific computing - such as computational biology, computational linguistics, and others - depend on Machine Learning algorithms to provide important core functionality to support solutions in the particular problem domains. However, it is difficult to test such applications because often there is no \"test oracle\" to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. To help address the quality of scientific computing software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called\r\"metamorphic testing\", which has been shown to be effective in such cases. In addition to presenting our technique, we describe a case study we performed on a real-world machine learning application framework, and discuss how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study. We also discuss how our findings can be of use to other areas of computational science and engineering.

During design system architects benefit from\rtools and techniques that enhance their understanding of\rthe system, allowing them to reason about the tradeoffs\rof proposed or existing self-healing mechanisms and the\roverall effectiveness of the system as a result of different\rmechanism-compositions. At deployment time, system integrators\rand operators need to understand how the selfhealing\rmechanisms work and how their operation impacts\rthe system’s reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS)\rin order to cope with any limitations of these mechanisms\rwhen the system is placed into production.\r\rIn this paper we construct an evaluation framework for selfhealing\rsystems around simple, yet powerful, probabilistic\rmodels that capture the behavior of the system’s selfhealing\rmechanisms from multiple perspectives (designer,\roperator, and end-user). We combine these analytical models\rwith runtime fault-injection to study the operation of\rVM-Rejuv – a virtual machine based rejuvenation scheme\rfor web-application servers. We use the results from the\rfault-injection experiments and model-analysis to reason\rabout the efficacy of VM-Rejuv, its limitations and strategies\rfor managing/mitigating these limitations in systemdeployments.\rWhereas we use VM-Rejuv as the subject of\rour evaluation in this paper, our main contribution is a\rpractical evaluation approach that can be generalized to\rother self-healing systems.

Carloni                    2009-01-15                    We present an embedded software application for the real-time estimation of building occupancy using a network of video cameras. We analyze a series of alternative decompositions of the main application tasks and profile each of them by running the corresponding embedded software on three different processors. Based on the profiling measures, we build various alternative embedded platforms by combining different embedded processors, memory modules and network interfaces.\rIn particular, we consider the choice of two possible network technologies: ARCnet and Ethernet. After deriving an analytical model of the network costs, we use it to complete an exploration of the design space as we scale the number of video cameras in an hypothetical building. We compare our results with those obtained for two real buildings of different characteristics. We conclude discussing the results of our case study in the broader context of other camera-network applications.

Recent virtualization trends exacerbate this problem by making it easy to create and deploy multiple virtual appliances per physical machine, each of which can be configured with different applications and utilities. This results in a huge scaling problem for large organizations as management overhead grows linearly with the number of appliances.\r\rTo address this problem, we present Strata, a system that introduces the Virtual Layered File System (VLFS) and integrates it with virtual appliances to simplify system management. Unlike a traditional file system, which is a monolithic entity, a VLFS is a collection of individual software layers composed together to provide the traditional file system view. Individual layers are maintained in a central repository and shared across all VLFSs that use them. Layer changes and upgrades only need to be done once in the repository and are then automatically propagated to all VLFSs, resulting in management overhead independent of the number of virtual appliances. We have implemented a Strata Linux prototype without any application or operating system kernel changes. Using this prototype, we demonstrate how Strata enables fast system provisioning, simplifies system maintenanc and upgrades, speeds system recovery from security exploits, and incurs only modest performance overhead.

The SHIM is a software/hardware integration language whose aim is to provide communication between hardware and software while providing deterministic concurrency.\r\rThe focus of this project will be to emphasize the efficiency of the SHIM language in embedded applications as compared to other existing implementations.

This will involve automating system-level metamorphic testing by treating the application as a black box and checking that the metamorphic properties of the entire application hold after execution. This will allow for metamorphic testing to be conducted in the production environment without affecting the user, and will not require the tester to have access to the source code. The tests do not require an oracle upon their creation; rather, the metamorphic properties act as built-in test oracles. We will also introduce an implementation framework called Amsterdam.\r\rSecond, we will present a new type of testing called Metamorphic Runtime Checking. This involves the execution of metamorphic tests from within the application, i.e., the application launches its own tests, within its current context. The tests execute within the application’s current state, and in particular check a function’s metamorphic properties. We will also present a system called Columbus that supports the execution of the Metamorphic Runtime Checking from within the context of the running application. Like Amsterdam, it will conduct the tests with acceptable performance overhead, and will ensure that the execution of the tests does not affect the state of the original application process from the users’ perspective; however, the  implementation of Columbus will be more challenging in that it will require more sophisticated mechanisms for conducting the tests without pre-empting the rest of the application, and for comparing the results\rwhich may conceivably be in different processes or environments.\r\rThird, we will describe a set of metamorphic testing guidelines that can be followed to assist in the formulation and specification of metamorphic properties that can be used with the above approaches. These will categorize the different types of properties exhibited by many applications in the domain of machine learning and data mining in particular (as a result of the types of applications we will investigate), but we will demonstrate that they are also generalizable to other domains as well. This set of guidelines will also correlate to the different types of defects that we expect the approaches will be able to find.

Data Races and Deadlocks are two major problems with concurrent programs. SHIM is a concurrent programming language that guarantees absence of data races through its semantics. However, a program written in SHIM can deadlock if not carefully written. \r\r In this paper, we present a divide-and-merge technique to statically detect deadlocks in SHIM. SHIM is asynchronous, but we can greatly reduce its state space without loosing precision because of its semantics.

Edwards                    2008-12-21                    The SHIM compiler for the IBM CELL processor generates distinct code for the two processing units, PPE (Power Processor Element) and SPE (Synergistic Processor Elements). The SPE is specialized to give high throughput with computation intensive application operating on dense data. We propose mechanism to tune the code generated by the SHIM compiler to enable optimizing compilers to generate structured code.\r\rAlthough, the discussion here is related to optimizing SHIM IR (Intermediate Representation) code, the techniques discussed here can be incorporated into compilers to convert unstructured loops consisting of goto statements to structured loops such as while and do-while statements to ease back end compiler optimizations.\r\rOur research based SHIM compiler takes the code written in SHIM language and performs various static analysis and finally transforms it into C code. This generated code is compiled to binary using standard compilers available for IBM cell processor such as GCC and IBM XL compiler.

Shah                    2008-12-21                    In a processor design the premier issues with\rmemory are (1) main memory allocation and (2)\rinterprocess communication. These two mainly\raffect the performance of the memory system. The\rgoal of this paper is to formulate a deterministic\rmodel for memory systems of PRET, taking into\raccount all the intertwined parallelism of modern\rmemory chips.\r\rStudying existing memory models is necessary\rto understand the implications of these factors to\rrealize a perfectly time predictable memory\rsystem.

Edwards                    2008-12-19                    Clocks are a mechanism for providing synchronization barriers in\rconcurrent programming languages. They are usually implemented using\rprimitive communication mechanisms and thus spare the programmer from\rreasoning about low-level implementation details such as remote\rprocedure calls and error conditions.\r\rClocks provide flexibility, but programs often use them in specific\rways that do not require their full implementation. In this paper, we\rdescribe a tool that mitigates the overhead of general-purpose clocks\rby statically analyzing how programs use them and choosing optimized\rimplementations when available.\r\rWe tackle the clock implementation in the standard library of the X10\rprogramming language---a parallel, distributed object-oriented\rlanguage. We report our findings for a small set of analyses and\rbenchmarks. Our tool only adds a few seconds to analysis time, making\rit practical to use as part of a compilation chain.

Borrowing ideas from democracy, our training phase allows each training instance to vote for an equal number of candidate size-2 patterns. Similar to the usual democratic election process, where voters select candidates by considering their qualifications, prior contributions at the constituency and territory levels, as well as their own perception about candidates, the training instances select patterns by effectively balancing between local, class, and global significance of patterns. In addition, we respect \"each voter's opinion\" by simultaneously adding shared patterns to all applicable classes, and then apply a novel power law based weighing scheme, instead of making binary decisions on these patterns.\r\rResults of experiments performed on 121 common text and web datasets show that our algorithm almost always outperforms state of the art classification algorithms, without requiring any dataset-specific parameter tuning. On 100 real-life, noisy, web datasets, the average absolute classification accuracy improvement was as great as 10% over SVM, Harmony, C4.5 and KNN. Also, our algorithm ran about 3.5 times faster than the fastest existing pattern-based classification algorithm.

Bugs such as security vulnerabilities, file storage issues, deadlocks and data races can occur anywhere in the state space and are often triggered by corner cases; therefore, it becomes important to explore and model check all runtime choices. However, large and complex software systems generate huge numbers of behaviors leading to ‘state explosion’. eXplode is a lightweight, deterministic and depth-bound model checker that explores all dynamic choices at runtime. Given an application-specific test-harness, eXplode performs state search in a serialized fashion - which limits its scalability and performance. This paper proposes a distributed eXplode engine that uses multiple host machines concurrently in order to achieve more state space coverage in less time, and is very helpful to scale up the software verification and validation effort. Test results show that Distributed eXplode runs several times faster and covers more state space than the standalone eXplode.

Nayar                    2008-11-24                    We propose the concept of a generalized assorted pixel (GAP) camera, which enables the user to\rcapture a single image of a scene and, after the fact, control the trade-off between spatial resolution,\rdynamic range and spectral detail. The GAP camera uses a complex array (or mosaic) of color filters.\rA major problem with using such an array is that the captured image is severely under-sampled for at\rleast some of the filter types. This leads to reconstructed images with strong aliasing. We make three\rcontributions in this paper: (a) We present a comprehensive optimization method to arrive at the spatial\rand spectral layout of the color filter array of a GAP camera. (b) We develop a novel anti-aliasing\ralgorithm for reconstructing the under-sampled channels of the image with minimal aliasing. (c) We\rdemonstrate how the user can capture a single image and then control the trade-off of spatial resolution\rto generate a variety of images, including monochrome, high dynamic range (HDR) monochrome, RGB,\rHDR RGB, and multispectral images. Finally, the performance of our GAP camera has been verified using extensive simulations that use multispectral images of real world scenes. A large database of these multispectral images is being made publicly available for use by the research community.

However, multicast service discovery protocols are considered to generate network traffic overhead, especially in a wireless network. Therefore, it becomes important to evaluate the traffic and overhead caused by multicast service discovery packets in real-world networks. We measure and analyze the traffic of one of the mostly deployed multicast service discovery protocols, multicast DNS (mDNS) service discovery, in a campus wireless network that forms a single multicast domain of large users. We also analyze different service discovery models in terms of packet overhead and service discovery delay under different network sizes and churn rates. Our measurement shows that mDNS traffic consumes about 13 percent of the total bandwidth.

It is challenging to test such applications, however, because they are intended to learn properties of data sets\rwhere the correct answers are not already known. Our work is not concerned with testing how well an ML algorithm learns, but rather\rseeks to ensure that an application using the algorithm implements the specification correctly and fulfills the users' expectations. These\rare critical to ensuring the application's dependability. This paper presents three approaches to testing these types of applications.\rIn the first, we create a set of limited test cases for which it is, in fact, possible to predict what the correct output should be. In\rthe second approach, we use random testing to generate large data sets according to parameterization based on the application’s\requivalence classes. Our third approach is based on metamorphic testing, in which properties of the application are exploited to define\rtransformation functions on the input, such that the new output can easily be predicted based on the original output. Here we discuss\rthese approaches, and our findings from testing the dependability of three real-world ML applications.

However, the various stations communicating with the AP often have different signal qualities, resulting in different transmission rates. This induces a phenomenon known as the rate anomaly problem, in which stations with lower signal\rquality transmit at lower rates and consume a significant majority of airtime, thereby dramatically reducing the throughput of stations transmitting at high rates. We propose a practical, deployable system, called SoftRepeater, in which stations cooperatively address the rate\ranomaly problem. Specifically, higher-rate Wi-Fi stations opportunistically transformthemselves into repeaters for stations\rwith low data-rates when transmitting to/from the AP. The key challenge is to determine when it is beneficial to enable the repeater functionality. In this paper, we propose an initiation protocol that ensures that repeater functionality is enabled only when appropriate. Also, our system can run directly on top of today’s 802.11 infrastructure networks. We also describe a novel, zero-overhead network coding scheme that further alleviates undesirable symptoms of the rate anomaly problem. We evaluate our system using simulation and testbed implementation, and find that SoftRepeater can improve cumulative throughput by up to 200%.

This research focus on enhancing the RAS capabilities of computing systems impacts not only the legacy/existing systems we have today, but also has implications for the design and development of next generation (self-\rmanaging/self-*) systems, which are expected to meet these non-functional requirements with minimal human intervention.\r\rTo reason about the RAS capabilities of the systems of today or the self-* systems of tomorrow, there are three evaluation-related challenges to address. First, developing (or identifying) practical fault-injection tools that can be used to study the failure behavior of\rcomputing systems and exercise any (remediation) mechanisms the system has available for mitigating or resolving problems. Second, identifying techniques that can be used to quantify RAS deficiencies in computing systems and reason about the e&#64259;cacy of individual or combined RAS-enhancing mechanisms (at design-time or after system deployment).\rThird, developing an evaluation methodology that can be used to objectively compare systems based on the (expected or actual) bene&#64257;ts of RAS-enhancing mechanisms.\r\rThis thesis addresses these three challenges by introducing the 7U Evaluation Methodology, a complementary approach to traditional performance-centric evaluations that identifies criteria for comparing and analyzing existing (or yet-to-be-added) RAS-enhancing mechanisms,\ris able to evaluate and reason about combinations of mechanisms, exposes under-performing mechanisms and highlights the lack of mechanisms in a rigorous, objective and quantitative\rmanner.\r\rThe development of the 7U Evaluation Methodology is based on the following three hypotheses. First, that runtime adaptation provides a platform for implementing e&#64259;cient and &#64258;exible fault-injection tools capable of in-situ and in-vivo interactions with computing systems. Second, that mathematical models such as Markov chains, Markov reward networks and Control theory models can successfully be used to create simple, reusable templates for describing speci&#64257;c failure scenarios and scoring the system’s responses, i.e., studying the failure-behavior of systems, and the various facets of its remediation mechanisms and\rtheir impact on system operation. Third, that combining practical fault-injection tools with mathematical modeling techniques based on Markov Chains, Markov Reward Networks and Control Theory can be used to develop a benchmarking methodology for evaluating and comparing the reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) characteristics of computing systems.\r\rThis thesis demonstrates how the 7U Evaluation Method can be used to evaluate the RAS capabilities of real-world computing systems and in so doing makes three contributions. First, a suite of runtime fault-injection tools (Kheiron tools) able to work in a variety\rof execution environments is developed. Second, analytical tools that can be used to construct mathematical models (RAS models) to evaluate and quantify RAS capabilities using appropriate metrics are discussed. Finally, the results and insights gained from conducting fault-injection experiments on real-world systems and modeling the system\rresponses (or lack thereof) using RAS models are presented. In conducting 7U Evaluations of real-world systems, this thesis highlights the similarities and differences between traditional performance-oriented evaluations and RAS-oriented evaluations and outlines a general\rframework for conducting RAS evaluations.

This\rmay be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, incorrect\rassumptions made during the creation of test cases,\ror the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible\rconfigurations for a complex system; these defects may also\rbe due to application states that were not considered during\rlab testing, or corrupted states that could arise due to\ra security violation. One approach to this problem is to\rcontinue to test these applications even after deployment,\rin hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we\rpresent a testing methodology we call in vivo testing, in\rwhich tests are continuously executed in the deployment\renvironment. We also describe a type of test we call in\rvivo tests that are specifically designed for use with such\ran approach: these tests execute within the current state of\rthe program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without\raffecting or altering that state from the perspective of the\rend-user. We discuss the approach and the prototype testing\rframework for Java applications called Invite. We also\rprovide the results of case studies that demonstrate Invite’s\reffectiveness and efficiency.

In the absence of a test oracle, one approach to testing these applications is to use metamorphic testing: existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x' such that we can predict f(x') based on f(x); if the application or function does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x') (or both) is wrong. By using metamorphic testing, we are able to provide built-in \"pseudo-oracles\" for these so-called \"nontestable programs\" that have no test oracles. In this paper, we describe an approach in which a function's\rmetamorphic properties are specified using an extension to the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral interface specification language that is used to support the \"design by contract\" paradigm in Java applications. Our implementation, called Corduroy, pre-processes these specifications and generates test code that can be executed using JML runtime assertion checking, for ensuring that the specifications hold during program execution. In addition to presenting our approach and implementation, we also describe our findings from case studies in which we apply our technique to applications without test oracles.

This work is an attempt to understand an analog hardwired communication system of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and effectively translate it into a generic, standards-based VoIP system that runs on their existing data network. We develop insights into the air traffic training and weigh on the design choices for building a soft real-time data communication system. We also share our real-world deployment and maintenance experiences, as the FAA Academy has been successfully using this VoIP system in five training rooms since 2006 to train the future air traffic controllers of the U.S. and the world.

Bellovin                    2008-09-24                    We are facing the exhaustion of newly assignable IPv4 addresses. Unfortunately, IPv6 is not yet deployed widely enough to fully replace IPv4, and it is unrealistic to expect that this is going to change before we run out of IPv4 addresses.  Letting hosts seamlessly communicate in an IPv4-world without assigning a unique globally routable IPv4 address to each of them is a challenging problem, for which many solutions have been proposed.  Some prominent ones target towards carrier-grade-NATs (CGN), which we feel is a bad idea.  Instead, we propose using specialized NATs at the edge that treat some of the port number bits as part of the address.

Keromytis, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2008-09-15                    We present Spectrogram, a mixture of Markov-chains sensor for anomaly detection (AD) against web-layer (port 80) code-injection attacks such as PHP file inclusion, SQL-injection, cross-site-scripting, as well as memory layer buffer overflows. Port 80 is the gateway to many application level services and a large array of attacks are channeled through this vector, servers cannot easily firewall this port. Signature-based sensors are effective in filtering known exploits but can’t detect 0-day vulnerabilities or deal with polymorphism and statistical AD approaches have mostly been limited to network layer, protocol-agnostic modeling, weakening their effectiveness. N -gram based modeling approaches have recently demonstrated success but the ill-posed nature of modeling large grams have thus far prevented exploration of higher order statistical models. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem based on a factorization into Markov-chains and aim to model higher order structure as well as content for web requests. Spectrogram is implemented in a protocol-aware, passive, network-situated, but CGI-layered, AD architecture and we show in our evaluation that this model demonstrates significant detection results on an array of real world web-layer attacks, achieving at least 97% detection rates on all but one dataset and comparing favorably against other AD sensors.

In this paper, we present a tool called Retina, which collects information about students' programming activities, and then provides useful and informative reports to both students and instructors based on the aggregation of that data. Retina can also make real-time recommendations to students, in order to help them quickly address some of the errors they make. In addition to describing Retina and its features, we also present some of our initial ndings during two trials of the tool in a real classroom setting.

Keromytis                    2008-08-18                    We present a novel, practical, and effective mechanism for\ridentifying the IP address of Tor clients. We approximate\ran almost-global passive adversary (GPA) capable of eavesdropping\ranywhere in the network by using LinkWidth, a novel bandwidth-estimation technique. LinkWidth allows network edge-attached entities to estimate the available bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host, router, or ISP. By modulating the bandwidth of an anonymous connection (e.g., when the destination server\ror its router is under our control), we can observe these fluctuations\ras they propagate through the Tor network and the Internet to the end-user’s IP address. Our technique exploits one of the design criteria for Tor (trading off GPA-resistance for improved latency/bandwidth over MIXes) by allowing well-provisioned (in terms of bandwidth) adversaries to effectively become GPAs.\r\rAlthough timing-based attacks have been demonstrated\ragainst non-timing-preserving anonymity networks, they have\rdepended either on a global passive adversary or on the compromise\rof a substantial number of Tor nodes. Our technique\rdoes not require compromise of any Tor nodes or collaboration\rof the end-server (for some scenarios). We demonstrate\rthe effectiveness of our approach in tracking the IP address\rof Tor users in a series of experiments. Even for an underprovisioned\radversary with only two network vantage points, we can identify the end user (IP address) in many cases.

Deux utilizes a dual-layer virtual\rmachine architecture, with lightweight application process\rcheckpoint and resume across OS versions, enabling simultaneous\rexecution of the same applications on both OS versions\rin different VMs. Inputs provided by ordinary users\rto the production old version are also fed to the new version.\rThe old OS acts as a pseudo-oracle for the update,\rand application state is automatically re-cloned to continue\rtesting after any output discrepancies (intercepted at system\rcall level) - all transparently to users. If all differences\rare deemed inconsequential, then the VM roles are\rswitched with the application state already in place. Our\rempirical evaluation with both LAMP and standalone applications\rdemonstrates Deux’s efficiency and effectiveness.

A complex network of interacting regulatory proteins bind specific sequence elements in the genome to control the amount and timing of gene expression. The abundance of genome-scale datasets from different organisms provides an opportunity to accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation. Developing computational tools to infer gene regulation programs from high-throughput genomic data is one of the central problems in computational biology.\r\rIn this thesis, we present a new predictive modeling framework for studying gene regulation. We formulate the problem of learning regulatory programs as a binary classification task: to accurately predict the the condition-specific activation (up-regulation) and repression (down-regulation) of gene expression. The gene expression response is measured by microarray expression data. Genes are represented by various genomic regulatory sequence features. Experimental conditions are represented by the gene expression levels of various regulatory proteins. We use this combination of features to learn a prediction function for the regulatory response of genes under different experimental conditions. The core computational approach is based on boosting. Boosting algorithms allow us to learn high-accuracy, large-margin classifiers and avoid overfitting. We describe three applications of our framework to study gene regulation:\r\r- In the GeneClass algorithm, we use a compendium of known transcription factor binding sites and gene expression data to learn a global context-specific regulation program that accurately predicts differential expression. GeneClass learns a prediction function in the form of an alternating decision tree, a margin-based generalization of a decision tree. We introduce a novel robust variant of boosting that improves stability and biological interpretability in the presence of correlated features. We also show how to incorporate genome-wide protein-DNA binding data from ChIP-chip experiments into the framework.\r- In several organisms, the DNA binding sites of many transcription factors are unknown. Hence, automatic discovery of regulatory sequence motifs is required. In the MEDUSA algorithm, we integrate raw promoter sequence data and gene expression data to simultaneously discover cis regulatory motifs ab initio and learn predictive regulatory programs. MEDUSA automatically learns probabilistic representations of motifs and their corresponding target genes. We show that we are able to accurately learn the binding sites of most known transcription factors in yeast.\r- We also design new techniques for extracting biologically and statistically significant information from the learned regulatory models. We use a margin-based score to extract global condition-specific regulomes as well as cluster-specific and gene-specific regulation programs. We develop a post-processing framework for interpreting and visualizing biological information encapsulated in our models.\r\rWe show the utility of our framework in analyzing several interesting biological contexts (environmental stress responses, DNA-damage response and hypoxia-response) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also show that our methods can learn regulatory programs and cis regulatory motifs in higher eukaryotes such as worms and humans. Several hypotheses generated by our methods are validated by our collaborators using biochemical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework is quantitatively and qualitatively predictive. We are able to achieve high prediction accuracy on test data and also generate specific, testable hypotheses.

Moreover, some such applications have no test oracles to indicate their correctness. In my thesis, we will address these problems in two ways. First, we suggest that executing tests within the context of an application running in the field can reveal defects that would not ordinarily otherwise be found. Second, we believe that this approach can further be extended to applications for which there is no test oracle by using a variant of metamorphic testing at runtime.

However, the quality of service (QoS) of VoIP traffic in wireless networks is still unsatisfactory. In this thesis, I identify several sources for the QoS problems of VoIP traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and propose solutions for these problems.\r\rThe QoS problems discussed can be divided into three categories, namely, user mobility, VoIP capacity, and call admission control. User mobility causes network disruptions during handoffs. In order to reduce the handoff time between Access Points (APs), I propose a new handoff algorithm, Selective Scanning and Caching, which finds available APs by scanning a minimum number of channels and furthermore allows clients to perform handoffs without scanning, by caching AP information. I also describe a new architecture for the client and server side for seamless IP layer handoffs, which are caused when mobile clients change the subnet due to layer 2 handoffs. \r\rI also present two methods to improve VoIP capacity for 802.11 networks, Adaptive Priority Control (APC) and Dynamic Point Coordination Function (DPCF). APC is a new packet scheduling algorithm at the AP and improves the capacity by balancing the uplink and downlink delay of VoIP traffic, and DPCF uses a polling based protocol and minimizes the bandwidth wasted from unnecessary polling, using a dynamic polling list. Additionally, I estimated the capacity for VoIP traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks via theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments in a wireless test-bed and show how to avoid mistakes in the measurements and comparisons.\r\rFinally, to protect the QoS for existing VoIP calls while maximizing the channel utilization, I propose a novel admission control algorithm called QP-CAT (Queue size Prediction using Computation of Additional Transmission), which accurately predicts the impact of new voice calls by virtually transmitting virtual new VoIP traffic.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           genSpace: Exploring Social Networking Metaphors for Knowledge Sharing and Scientific Collaborative Work                                        Christian Murphy, Swapneel Sheth, Gail Kaiser, Lauren Wilcox                    2008-06-13                    Many collaborative applications, especially in scientific\rresearch, focus only on the sharing of tools or the sharing\rof data. We seek to introduce an approach to scientific collaboration\rthat is based on knowledge sharing. We do this\rby automatically building organizational memory and enabling\rknowledge sharing by observing what users do with\ra particular tool or set of tools in the domain, through the\raddition of activity and usage monitoring facilities to standalone\rapplications. Once this knowledge has been gathered,\rwe apply social networking models to provide collaborative\rfeatures to users, such as suggestions on tools to use,\rand automatically-generated sequences of actions based on\rpast usage amongst the members of a social network or\rthe entire community. In this work, we investigate social\rnetworking models as an approach to scientific knowledge\rsharing, and present an implementation called genSpace,\rwhich is built as an extension to the geWorkbench platform\rfor computational biologists. Last, we discuss the approach\rfrom the viewpoint of social software engineering.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Application Layer Feedback-based SIP Server Overload Control                                        Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Erich Nahum                    2008-06-06                    A SIP server may be overloaded by emergency-induced call volume,\r\"American Idol\" style flash crowd effects or denial of service\rattacks. The SIP server overload problem is interesting especially\rbecause the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be\rsimilar. For this reason, the built-in SIP\roverload control mechanism based on generating rejection messages\rcannot prevent the server from entering congestion collapse under\rheavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a pushback control\rsolution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server may\rnotify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the\ramount of load within the receiving server's processing capacity.\rThe pushback framework can be achieved by SIP application layer rate-based\rfeedback or window-based feedback. The centerpiece of the\rfeedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load\rregulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback\ralgorithms and evaluate them together with two existing rate-based\rfeedback algorithms. We compare the different algorithms in terms\rof the number of tuning parameters and performance under both steady\rand variable load. Furthermore, we identify two categories of\rfairness requirements for SIP overload control, namely,\ruser-centric and provider-centric fairness. With the introduction\rof a new double-feed SIP overload control architecture, we show\rhow the algorithms meet those fairness criteria.

Some\rheavyweight systems have become part of designated ``centers''\rproviding remote access to supercomputers and/or clusters supported by\rsubstantial government funding; others use virtual supercomputers\rdispersed across grids formed by massive numbers of volunteer\rInternet-connected computers. But public funds are limited and not all\rsystems are amenable to huge-scale divisibility into independent\rcomputation units. We have identified a class of scientific computing\rsystems where ``utility'' sub-jobs can be offloaded to any of several\ralternative providers thereby freeing up local cycles for the main\rproprietary jobs, implemented a proof-of-concept framework enabling\rsuch deployments, and analyzed its expected throughput and\rresponse-time impact on a real-world bioinformatics system (Columbia's\rPredictProtein) whose present users endure long wait queues.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FairTorrent: Bringing Fairness to Peer-to-Peer Systems                                        Alex Sherman, Jason Nieh, Clifford Stein                    2008-05-27                    The lack of fair bandwidth allocation in Peer-to-Peer systems causes\r many performance problems, including users being disincentivized from\rcontributing upload bandwidth, free riders taking as much from the\rsystem as possible while contributing as little as possible, and a\rlack of quality-of-service guarantees to support streaming\rapplications.  We present FairTorrent, a simple distributed scheduling\ralgorithm for Peer-to-Peer systems that fosters fair bandwidth\rallocation among peers.  For each peer, FairTorrent maintains a deficit\rcounter which represents the number of bytes uploaded to a peer minus\rthe number of bytes downloaded from it.  It then uploads to the peer\rwith the lowest deficit counter.  FairTorrent automatically adjusts to\rvariations in bandwidth among peers and is resilient to exploitation\rby free-riding peers.  We have implemented FairTorrent inside a BitTorrent client without modifications to the BitTorrent protocol, and compared its performance on PlanetLab against other widely-used BitTorrent clients.  Our results show that FairTorrent can provide up to two orders of magnitude better fairness and up to five times better download performance for high contributing peers.  It thereby gives users an incentive to contribute more bandwidth, and improve overall system performance.

Forte, Sangho Shin, Henning Schulzrinne                    2008-05-05                    We observed wireless network traffic at the 65th IETF Meeting in Dallas, Texas in March of 2006, attended by approximately 1200 engineers. The event was supported by a very large number of 802.11a and 802.11b access points, often seeing hundreds of simultaneous users. We were particularly interested in the stability of wireless connectivity, load balancing and loss behavior, rather than just traffic.We observed distinct differences among client implementations and saw a number of factors that made the overall system less than optimal, pointing to the need for better design tools and automated adaptation mechanisms.

Bellovin                    2008-05-03                    We propose a firewall architecture that treats port numbers as part of the IP address.  Hosts permit connectivity to a service by advertising the IPaddr:port/48 address; they block connectivity by ensuring that there is no route to it.  This design, which is especially well-suited to MANETs, provides greater protection against insider attacks than do conventional firewalls, but drops unwanted traffic far earlier than distributed firewalls do.

However, conventional\ruses of P2P networking involve distributing stored\rfiles for use after the entire file has been downloaded. In\rthis work, we investigate whether P2P networking can be\rused to provide real-time playback capabilities for stored\rmedia. For real-time playback, users should be able to start\rplayback immediately, or almost immediately, after requesting\rthe media and have uninterrupted playback during the\rdownload. To achieve this goal, it is critical to efficiently\rschedule the order in which pieces of the desired media\rare downloaded. Simply downloading pieces in sequential\r(earliest-first) order is prone to bottlenecks. Consequently\rwe propose a hybrid of earliest-first and rarest-first scheduling\r- ensuring high piece diversity while at the same time\rprioritizing pieces needed to maintain uninterrupted playback.\rWe consider an approach to peer-assisted streaming\rthat is based on BitTorrent. In particular, we show that dynamic\radjustment of the probabilities of earliest-first and\rrarest-first strategies along with utilization of coding techniques\rpromoting higher data diversity, can offer noticeable\rimprovements for real-time playback.

Parametric query\roptimization(PQO) has as its goal the prediction of optimal query\rexecution plans based on historical results, without consulting the\rquery optimizer.  We develop machine learning techniques that can\raccurately model the output of a query optimizer. Our algorithms\rhandle non-linear boundaries in plan space and achieve high prediction\raccuracy even when a limited amount of data is available for training.\rWe use both predicted and actual query execution times for learning,\rand are the first to demonstrate a total net win of a PQO method over\ra state-of-the-art query optimizer for some workloads.  ReoptSMART\rrealizes savings not only in optimization time, but also in query\rexecution time, for an over-all improvement by more than an order of\rmagnitude in some cases.

Stolfo                    2008-04-14                    This paper presents one-class Hellinger distance-based and one-class SVM modeling techniques that use a set of features to reveal user intent. The specific objective is to model user command profiles and detect deviations indicating a masquerade attack. The approach aims to model user intent, rather than only modeling sequences of user issued commands.  We hypothesize that each individual user will search in a targeted and limited fashion in order to find information germane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another user's desktop, and would likely search more extensively and broadly. Hence, modeling a user search behavior to detect deviations may more accurately detect masqueraders. To that end, we extend prior research that uses UNIX command sequences issued by users as the audit source by relying upon an abstraction of commands. We devised a taxonomy of UNIX commands that is used to abstract command sequences.  The experimental results show that the approach does not lose information and performs comparably to or slightly better than the modeling approach based on simple UNIX command frequencies.

We formulate a probability distribution whose partition function is exactly the permanent, then use Bethe free energy to approximate this partition function. After deriving some speedups to standard belief propagation, the resulting algorithm requires $(n^2)$ time per iteration. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of using this approximation.

In order to enhance current NAC technologies, we propose a new architecture based on behaviors rather than roles or identity, where the policies are automatically learned and updated over time by the members of the network in order to adapt to behavioral\rchanges of the devices. Behavior pro&#64257;les may be presented as identity cards that can change over time. By incorporating an Anomaly Detector (AD) to the NAC server or to each of the hosts, their behavior pro&#64257;le is\rmodeled and used to determine the type of behaviors that should be accepted within the network. These models constitute behavior-based policies. In our enhanced NAC architecture, global decisions are made using a group voting process. Each host’s behavior pro&#64257;le is used to compute a partial decision for or against the acceptance of a new pro&#64257;le or traf&#64257;c. The aggregation of these partial votes amounts to the model-group decision. This voting process makes the architecture more resilient to attacks. Even after accepting a certain percentage of malicious devices, the enhanced NAC is able to compute an adequate decision. We provide proof-of-concept experiments of our architecture using web traf&#64257;c from our department network. Our results show that the model-group decision approach based on behavior pro&#64257;les has a 99% detection rate of anomalous traf&#64257;c with a false positive rate of\ronly 0.005%. Furthermore, the architecture achieves short latencies for both the pre- and post-connect phases.

Keromytis                    2008-03-27                    Enterprise networks are ubiquitious and increasingly complex.  The\rmechanisms for defining security policies in these networks have not\rkept up with the advancements in networking technology.  In most\rcases, system administrators must define policies on a per-application\rbasis, and subsequently, these policies do not interact.  For example,\rthere is no mechanism that allows a firewall to communicate decisions\rbased on its ruleset to a web server behind it, even though decisions\rbeing made at the firewall may be relevant to decisions made at the\rweb server.  In this paper, we describe a path-based access control\rsystem which allows applications in a network to pass\raccess-control-related information to neighboring applications, as the\rapplications process requests from outsiders and from each other.\rThis system defends networks against a class of attacks wherein\rindividual applications may make correct access control decisions but\rthe resulting network behavior is incorrect.  We demonstrate the\rsystem on service-oriented architecture (SOA)-style networks, in two\rforms, using graph-based policies, and leveraging the KeyNote trust\rmanagement system.

Werschulz, Henryk Wozniakowski                    2008-03-25                    We study $d$-variate approximation for a weighted unanchored Sobolev\r  space having smoothness $m\\ge1$.  Folk wisdom would lead us to believe\r  that this problem should become easier as its smoothness increases.  This\r  is true if we are only concerned with asymptotic analysis: the $n$th\r  minimal error is of order~$n^{-(m-\\delta)}$ for any $\\delta>0$.  However,\r  it is unclear how long we need to wait before this asymptotic behavior\r  kicks in.  How does this waiting period depend on $d$ and~$m$?  We prove\r  that no matter how the weights are chosen, the waiting period is at\r  least~$m^d$, even if the error demand~$\\varepsilon$ is arbitrarily close\r  to~$1$.  Hence, for $m\\ge2$, this waiting period is exponential in~$d$,\r  so that the problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is\r  intractable.  In other words, the fact that the asymptotic behavior\r  improves with~$m$ is irrelevant when $d$~is large.  So, we will be unable\r  to vanquish the curse of dimensionality unless $m=1$, i.e., unless the\r  smoothness is minimal.  We then show that our problem \\emph{can} be\r  tractable if $m=1$.  That is, we can find an $\\varepsilon$-approximation\r  using polynomially-many (in $d$ and~$\\varepsilon^{-1}$) information\r  operations, even if only function values are permitted.  When $m=1$, it\r  is even possible for the problem to be \\emph{strongly} tractable, i.e.,\r  we can find an $\\varepsilon$-approximation using polynomially-many\r  (in~$\\varepsilon^{-1}$) information operations, independent of~$d$.\r  These positive results hold when the weights of the Sobolev space decay\r  sufficiently quickly or are bounded finite-order weights, i.e., the\r  $d$-variate functions we wish to approximate can be decomposed as sums of\r  functions depending on at most~$\\omega$ variables, where $\\omega$ is\r  independent of~$d$.

We envision SCANs to enable a diverse set of applications such as self-spreading mesh networks and robotic search and rescue systems.  This paper describes our experiences developing a prototype robotic SCAN built from commercial, off-the-shelf hardware, to support such applications.  A major contribution of our work is the development of a protocol, called SCAN1, which maintains network connectivity by enabling individual nodes to determine when they must constrain their mobility in order to avoid disconnecting the network.  SCAN1 achieves its goal through an entirely distributed process in which individual nodes utilize only local (2-hop) knowledge of the network's topology to periodically make a simple decision: move, or freeze in place.   Along with experimental results from our hardware testbed, we model SCAN1's performance, providing both supporting analysis and simulation for the efficacy of SCAN1 as a solution to enable SCANs.  While our evaluation of SCAN1 in this paper is limited to systems whose capabilities match those of our testbed, SCAN1 can be utilized in conjunction with a wide-range of potential applications and environments, as either a primary or backup connectivity maintenance mechanism.

Carloni                    2008-03-18                    Latency-insensitive design is a methodology for system-on-chip (SoC) design that simplifies the reuse of intellectual property cores and the implementation of the communication among them. This simplification is based on a system-level protocol that decouples the intra-core logic design from the design of the inter-core communication channels. Each core is encapsulated within a shell, a synthesized logic block that dynamically controls its operation to interface it with the rest of the SoC and to absorb any latency variations on its I/O signals. In particular, a shell stalls a core whenever new valid data are not available on the input channels or a down-link core has requested a delay in the data production on the output channels. \r\rWe study how knowledge about the internal logic structure of a core can be applied to the design of its shell to improve the overall system-level performance by avoiding unnecessary local stalling. We introduce the notion of functional independence conditions (FIC) and present a novel circuit design of a generic shell template that can leverage FIC. We propose a procedure for the logic synthesis of a FIC-shell instance that is only based on the analysis of the intra-core logic and does not require any input from the designers. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental analysis that shows the performance benefits and limited design overhead of the proposed technique. This includes the semi-custom design of an SoC, an ultra-wideband baseband transmitter, using a 90nm industrial standard cell library.

Nonetheless, popular applications such as Skype use\rTCP due to the deployment of NATs and firewalls that prevent UDP\rtraffic. Motivated by this observation we study the delay\rperformance of TCP for real-time media flows. We develop an\ranalytical performance model for the delay of TCP. We use\rextensive experiments to validate the model and to evaluate the\rimpact of various TCP mechanisms on its delay performance. Based\ron our results, we derive the working region for VoIP and live\rvideo streaming applications and provide guidelines for\rdelay-friendly TCP settings. Our research indicates that simple\rapplication-level schemes, such as packet splitting and parallel\rconnections, can reduce the delay of real-time TCP flows by as\rmuch as 30\\% and 90\\%, respectively.

In the absence of a test oracle, one approach to testing these applications is to use metamorphic testing, in which properties of the application are exploited to define transformation\rfunctions on the input, such that the new output will be unchanged or can easily be predicted based on the original output; if the output is not as expected, then a defect must exist in the application. Here, we seek to enumerate and classify the metamorphic properties of some machine learning algorithms, and demonstrate how these can be applied\rto reveal defects in the applications of interest. In addition to the results of our testing, we present a set of properties that can be used to define these metamorphic relationships so that metamorphic testing can be used as a general approach to testing machine learning applications.

Although SCTP is an\ralternative transport protocol for the Session Initiation Protocol\r(SIP), we do not know how SCTP features influence SIP server\rscalability and performance. To estimate this, we measured the\rscalability and performance of two servers, an echo server and a\rsimplified SIP server on Linux, comparing to TCP.\rOur measurements found that using SCTP does not significantly\raffect on data latency: approximately 0.3 ms longer for the handshake than that for TCP.

Ross, John Cieslewicz                    2008-02-27                    Partitioning is an important step in several database algorithms, including sorting, aggregation, and joins. Partitioning is also fundamental for dividing work into equal-sized (or balanced) parallel subtasks. In this paper, we aim to find, materialize and maintain a set of partitioning elements (splitters) for a data set. Unlike traditional partitioning elements, our splitters define both inequality and equality partitions, which allows us to bound the size of the inequality partitions. We provide an algorithm for determining an optimal set of splitters from a sorted data set and show that it has time complexity O(k lg_2 N), where k is the number of splitters requested and N is the size of the data set. We show how the algorithm can be extended to pairs of tables, so that joins can be partitioned into work units that have balanced cost. We demonstrate experimentally (a) that finding the optimal set of splitters can be done efficiently, and (b) that using the precomputed splitters can improve the time to sort a data set by up to 76%, with particular benefits in the presence of a few heavy hitters.

How does the choice of TCP affect the scalability and performance compared to UDP? We experimentally analyze the impact of using TCP as a transport protocol for a SIP server. We first investigate scalability of a TCP echo server, then compare performance of a SIP server for three TCP connection lifetimes: transaction, dialog, and persistent. Our results show that a Linux machine can establish 450,000+ TCP connections and maintaining connections does not affect the transaction response time. Additionally, the transaction response times using the three TCP connection lifetimes and UDP show no significant difference at 2,500 registration requests/second and at 500 call requests/second. However, sustainable request rate is lower for TCP than for UDP, since using TCP requires more message processing. More message processing causes longer delays at the thread queue for the server implementing a thread-pool model. Finally, we suggest how to reduce the impact of TCP for a scalable SIP server especially under overload control. This is applicable to other servers with very large connection counts.

Bellovin                    2008-02-16                    Internet applications are being used for more and more important business and personal purposes. Despite efforts to lock down web servers and isolate databases, there is an inherent problem in the web application architecture that leaves databases necessarily exposed to possible attack from the Internet. We propose a new design that removes the web server as a trusted component of the architecture and provides an extra layer of protection against database attacks. We have created a prototype system that demonstrates the feasibility of the new design.

Buss                    2008-02-07                    Modern society is irreversibly dependent on computers and,\rconsequently, on software. However, as the complexity of programs\rincrease, so does the number of defects within them. To\ralleviate the problem, automated techniques are constantly used to\rimprove software quality. Static analysis is one such approach in\rwhich violations of correctness properties are searched and\rreported. Static analysis has many advantages, but it is necessarily\rconservative because it symbolically executes the program instead of\rusing real inputs, and it considers all possible executions\rsimultaneously. Being conservative often means issuing false alarms,\ror missing real program errors.\r\rPointer variables are a challenging aspect of many languages that can\rforce static analysis tools to be overly conservative. It is often\runclear what variables are affected by pointer-manipulating\rexpressions, and aliasing between variables is one of the banes of\rprogram analysis. To alleviate that, a common solution is to allow\rthe programmer to provide annotations such as declaring a variable\ras unaliased in a given scope, or providing special constructs\rsuch as the ``never-null'' pointer of Cyclone. However,\rprogrammers rarely keep these annotations up-to-date.\r\rThe solution is to provide some form of pointer analysis, which\rderives useful information about pointer variables in the program.  An\rappropriate pointer analysis equips the static tool so that it is\rcapable of reporting more errors without risking too many false alarms.\r\rThis dissertation proposes a methodology for pointer analysis that is\rspecially tailored for ``modular bug finding.'' It presents a new\ranalysis space for pointer analysis, defined by finer-grain ``dimensions\rof precision,'' which allows us to explore and evaluate a variety of\rdifferent algorithms to achieve better trade-offs between analysis\rprecision and efficiency. This framework is developed around a new\rabstraction for computing points-to sets, the Assign-Fetch Graph, that\rhas many interesting features. Empirical evaluation shows promising\rresults, as some unknown errors in well-known applications were\rdiscovered.

Stolfo                    2008-01-31                    Embedding malcode within documents provides a convenient means of penetrating systems which may be unreachable by network-level service attacks. Such attacks can be very targeted and difficult to detect compared to the typical network worm threat due to the multitude of document-exchange vectors. Detecting malcode embedded in a document is difficult owing to the complexity of modern document formats that provide ample opportunity to embed code in a myriad of ways. We focus on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers as a case study in this paper. We introduce a hybrid system that integrates static and dynamic techniques to detect the presence and location of malware embedded in documents. The system is designed to automatically update its detection models to improve accuracy over time. The overall hybrid detection system with a learning feedback loop is demonstrated to achieve a 99.27% detection rate and 3.16% false positive rate on a corpus of 6228 Word documents.

This may be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, assumptions made during the creation of test cases, or the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible configurations for a complex system. Testing approaches such as perpetual testing or continuous testing seek to continue to test these applications even after deployment, in hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we present our initial work towards a testing methodology we call in vivo testing, in which unit tests are continuously executed inside a running application in the deployment environment. These tests execute within the current state of the program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without affecting or altering that state. Our approach can reveal defects both in the applications of interest and in the unit tests themselves. It can also be used for detecting concurrency or robustness issues that may not have appeared in a testing lab. Here we describe the approach and the testing framework called Invite that we have developed for Java applications. We also enumerate the classes of bugs our approach can discover, and provide the results of a case study on a publicly-available application, as well as the results of experiments to measure the added overhead.

One of the\rmain reasons is that the current P2P systems cannot guarantee\rreasonable performance as they depend on the willingness of users to\rcontribute bandwidth. Moreover, even systems like BitTorrent, which\remploy a tit-for-tat protocol to encourage fair bandwidth exchange\rbetween users, are prone to free-riding (i.e. peers that do not\rupload). Our experiments on PlanetLab extend previous research\r(e.g. LargeViewExploit, BitTyrant) demonstrating that\rsuch selfish behavior can seriously degrade the performance of regular\rusers in many more scenarios beyond simple free-riding: we observed an\roverhead of upto 430\\% for 80\\% of free-riding identities easily\rgenerated by a small set of selfish users.\r\rTo mitigate the effects of selfish users, we propose a new P2P\rarchitecture that classifies peers with the help of a small number of\r{\\em trusted nodes} that we call Trusted Auditors (TAs). TAs\rparticipate in P2P download like regular clients and detect\rfree-riding identities by observing their neighbors' behavior. Using\rTAs, we can separate compliant users into a separate service pool\rresulting in better performance. Furthermore, we show that TAs are\rmore effective ensuring the performance of the system than a mere\rincrease in bandwidth capacity: for 80\\% of free-riding identities a\rsingle-TA system has a 6\\% download time overhead while without the\rTA and three times the bandwidth capacity we measure a 100\\%\roverhead.

In this paper, we present the results of a three-year study of such an online software engineering course targeted to graduate students, and describe some of the specific challenges faced, such as students’ aversion to aspects of XP and difficulties in scheduling. We discuss our findings in terms of the course’s educational objectives, and present suggestions to other educators who may face similar situations.

At each clock period, if new data has not arrived on an input channel or a stalling request has arrived on an output channel, the shell stalls the core and buffers other incoming valid data for future processing.  The combination of finite buffers and backpressure from stalling can cause throughput degradation.  Previous works addressed this problem by increasing buffer space to reduce the backpressure requests or inserting extra buffering to balance the channel latency around a LIS.  We explore the theoretical complexity of these approaches and propose a heuristic algorithm for efficient queue sizing.  We also practically characterize several LIS topologies and how the topology of a LIS can impact not only how much throughput degradation will occur, but also the difficulty of finding optimal queue sizing solutions.

Keromytis                    2008-01-05                    We introduce LinkWidth, a method for estimating capacity and available\rbandwidth using single-end controlled TCP packet probes. To estimate\rcapacity, we generate a train of TCP RST packets ``sandwiched''\rbetween trains of TCP SYN packets. Capacity is computed from the\rend-to-end packet dispersion of the received TCP RST/ACK packets\rcorresponding to the TCP SYN packets going to closed ports. Our\rtechnique is significantly different from the rest of the packet-pair\rbased measurement techniques, such as {\\em CapProbe,} {\\em pathchar}\rand {\\em pathrate,} because the long packet trains minimize errors due\rto bursty cross-traffic. Additionally, TCP RST packets do not generate\radditional ICMP replies, thus avoiding cross-traffic due to such\rpackets from interfering with our probes. In addition, we use TCP\rpackets for all our probes to prevent QoS-related traffic shaping\r(based on packet types) from affecting our measurements (eg. CISCO\rrouters by default are known have to very high latency while\rgenerating to ICMP TTL expired replies).\r\rWe extend the {\\it Train of Packet Pairs} technique to approximate the\ravailable link capacity. We use a train of TCP packet pairs with\rvariable intra-pair delays and sizes. This is the first attempt to\rimplement this technique using single-end TCP probes, tested on a\rrange of networks with different bottleneck capacities and cross\rtraffic rates. The method we use for measuring from a single point of\rcontrol uses TCP RST packets between a train of TCP SYN packets. The\ridea is quite similar to the technique for measuring the bottleneck\rcapacity. We compare our prototype with {\\em pathchirp,} {\\em\rpathload,} {\\em IPERF,} which require control of both ends as well as\ranother single end controlled technique {\\em abget}, and demonstrate\rthat in most cases our method gives approximately the same results if\rnot better.

In this paper we attempt to improve the recall of text search by automatically assigning appropriate tags to models. Our algorithm finds relevant tags by appealing to a large corpus of partially labeled example models, which does not have to be preclassified or otherwise prepared. For this purpose we use a copy of Google 3DWarehouse, a database of user contributed models which is publicly available on the Internet. Given a model to tag, we find geometrically similar models in the corpus, based on distances in a reduced dimensional space derived from Zernike descriptors. The labels of these neighbors are used as tag candidates for the model with probabilities proportional to the degree of geometric similarity. We show experimentally that text based search for 3D models using our computed tags can work as well as geometry based search. Finally, we demonstrate our 3D model search engine that uses this algorithm and discuss some implementation issues.

Ross, Julia Stoyanovich                    2007-12-17                    Conceptual complexity is emerging as a new bottleneck as database\rdevelopers, application developers, and database administrators\rstruggle to design and comprehend large, complex schemas.  The\rsimplicity and conciseness of a schema depends critically on the\ridioms available to express the schema.  We propose a formal\rconceptual schema representation language that combines different\rdesign formalisms, and allows schema manipulation that exposes the\rstrengths of each of these formalisms. We demonstrate how the schema\rfactorization framework can be used to generate relational,\robject-oriented, and faceted physical schemas, allowing a wider\rexploration of physical schema alternatives than traditional\rmethodologies.  We illustrate the potential practical benefits of\rschema factorization by showing that simple heuristics can\rsignificantly reduce the size of a real-world schema description.  We\ralso propose the use of schema polynomials to model and derive\ralternative representations for complex relationships with\rconstraints.

Data intensive programs are difficult to program on multicore architectures because they require efficient utilization of inter-core communication.  Models for programming multicore systems available today generally lack the ability to automatically extract concurrency from a sequential style program and map concurrent tasks to efficiently leverage data and temporal locality.  For divide-and-conquer algorithms, a recursive programming model can address both of these problems.  Furthermore, since a recursive function has the same behavior patterns at all granularities of a problem, the same recursive model can be used to implement a multicore program at all of its levels: 1. the operations of a single core, 2. how to distribute tasks among several cores, and 3. in what order  to schedule tasks on a multicore system when it is not possible to schedule all of the tasks at the same time.  We present a novel selective execution technique that can enable automatic parallelization and task mapping of a recursive program onto a multicore system.  To verify the practicality of this approach, we perform a case-study of bitonic sort on the Cell BE processor.

Nayar                    2007-11-25                    This paper presents a complete framework for creating speech-enabled\r2D and 3D avatars from a single image of a person. Our approach uses a\rgeneric facial motion model which represents deformations of the prototype face during speech. \rWe have developed an HMM-based facial\ranimation algorithm which takes into account both lexical stress and\rcoarticulation. This algorithm produces realistic animations of the\rprototype facial surface from either text or speech. The generic facial motion model is transformed to\ra novel face geometry using a set of corresponding points between the generic mesh and the novel face.\rIn the case of a 2D avatar, a single photograph of the person is used as input. We manually select a small number of features on the photograph and these are used to deform the prototype surface. The deformed surface is then used to animate the photograph. In the case of a 3D avatar, we use a single stereo image of the person as input. The sparse geometry of the face is computed from this image and used to warp the prototype surface to obtain the complete 3D surface of the person's face. This surface is etched into a glass cube using sub-surface laser engraving (SSLE) technology. Synthesized facial animation videos are then projected onto the etched glass cube. Even though the etched surface is static, the projection of facial animation onto it results in a compelling experience for the viewer. We show several examples of 2D and 3D avatars that are driven by text and speech inputs.

Most of the successful partial evaluators have\rbeen designed for general-purpose languages. Our observation is that\rdomain-specific languages are also suitable targets for partial\revaluation. The unusual computational models in many DSLs bring\rchallenges as well as optimization opportunities to the compiler.\r\rTo enable aggressive optimization, partial evaluation\rhas to be specialized to fit the specific paradigm of a DSL. In this\rdissertation, we present three such specialized partial evaluation\rtechniques designed for specific languages that address a variety of\rcompilation concerns. The first algorithm provides a low-cost solution\rfor simulating concurrency on a single-threaded processor. The second\renables a compiler to compile modest-sized synchronous programs in\rpieces that involve communication cycles. The third statically\relaborates recursive function calls that enable programmers to\rdynamically create a system's concurrent components in a convenient\rand algorithmic way. Our goal is to demonstrate the potential of\rpartial evaluation to solve challenging issues in code generation for\rdomain-specific languages.\r\rNaturally, we do not cover all DSL compilation issues.  We hope our\rwork will enlighten and encourage future research on the application\rof partial evaluation to this area.

The motivation is that\rthe “known state” approach of traditional unit testing is unrealistic;\rdeployed applications rarely operate under such\rconditions, and it may be more informative to perform the\rtesting in live environments. One of the limitations of this\rapproach is the high performance cost it incurs, as the unit\rtests are executed in parallel with the application. Here we\rpresent distributed in vivo testing, which focuses on easing\rthe burden by sharing the load across multiple instances of\rthe application of interest. That is, we elevate the scope\rof in vivo testing from a single instance to a community of\rinstances, all participating in the testing process. Our approach\ris different from prior work in that we are actively\rtesting during execution, as opposed to passively monitoring\rthe application or conducting tests in the user environment\rprior to execution. We discuss new extensions to\rthe existing in vivo testing framework (called Invite) and\rpresent empirical results that show the performance overhead\rimproves linearly with the number of clients.

Werschulz                    2007-11-08                    We want to compute a worst case $\\varepsilon$-approximation to the solution\rof the Helmholtz equation $-\\Delta u+qu=f$ over the unit $d$-cube~$I^d$,\rsubject to Neumann boundary conditions $\\partial_\\nu u=g$ on~$\\partial\rI^d$.  Let $\\mathop{\\rm card}(\\varepsilon,d)$ denote the minimal number of\revaluations of $f$, $g$, and~$q$ needed to compute an absolute or\rnormalized $\\varepsilon$-approximation, assuming that $f$, $g$, and~$q$\rvary over balls of weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.  This\rproblem is said to be weakly tractable if $\\mathop{\\rm\r  card}(\\varepsilon,d)$ grows subexponentially in~$\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and\r$d$.  It is said to be polynomially tractable if $\\mathop{\\rm\r  card}(\\varepsilon,d)$ is polynomial in~$\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and~$d$, and\rstrongly polynomially tractable if this polynomial is independent of~$d$.\rWe have previously studied tractability for the homogeneous version $g=0$\rof this problem.  In this paper, we investigate the tractability of the\rnon-homogeneous problem, with general~$g$.  First, suppose that we use\rproduct weights, in which the role of any variable is moderated by its\rparticular weight.  We then find that if the weight sum is sublinearly\rbounded, then the problem is weakly tractable; moreover, this condition is\rmore or less necessary.  We then show that the problem is polynomially\rtractable if the weight sum is logarithmically or uniformly bounded, and we\restimate the exponents of tractability for these two cases.  Next, we turn\rto finite-order weights of fixed order~$\\omega$, in which a $d$-variate\rfunction can be decomposed as sum, each term depending on at most\r$\\omega$~variables.  We show that the problem is always polynomially\rtractable for finite-order weights, and we give estimates for the exponents\rof tractability.  Since our results so far have established nothing\rstronger than polynomial tractability, we look more closely at whether\rstrong polynomial tractability is possible.  We show that our problem is\rnever strongly polynomially tractable for the absolute error criterion.\rMoreover, we believe that the same is true for the normalized error\rcriterion, but we have been able to prove this lack of strong tractability\ronly when certain conditions hold on the weights.  Finally, we use the\rKorobov- and min-kernels, along with product weights, to illustrate our\rresults.

Implementing packet processors in pipelined\rarchitectures is a well-known, established technique, albeit different\rapproaches have been proposed.\r\rThe design of packet processing pipelines is a delicate trade-off\rbetween the desire for abstract specifications, short development time,\rand design maintainability on one hand and very aggressive performance\rrequirements on the other.\r\rThis thesis proposes a coherent design flow for packet processing\rpipelines.  Like the design process itself, I start by introducing a\rnovel domain-specific language that provides a high-level\rspecification of the pipeline.  Next, I address synthesizing this\rmodel and calculating its worst-case throughput.  Finally, I address\rsome specific circuit optimization issues.\r\rI claim, based on experimental results, that my proposed technique can\rdramatically improve the design process of these pipelines, while the\rresulting performance matches the expectations of hand-crafted design.\r\rThe considered pipelines exhibit a pseudo-linear topology, which can\rbe too restrictive in the general case.  However, especially due to\rits high performance, such an architecture may be suitable for\rapplications outside packet processing, in which case some of my\rproposed techniques could be easily adapted.\r\rSince I ran my experiments on FPGAs, this work has an inherent bias\rtowards that technology; however, most results are\rtechnology-independent.

We study linear tensor product\rproblems for which we can compute linear information which is given by\rarbitrary continuous linear functionals. We want to approximate an\roperator $S_d$ given as the $d$-fold tensor product of a compact\rlinear operator $S_1$ for $d=1,2,\\dots\\,$, with $\\|S_1\\|=1$ and $S_1$\rhas at least two positive singular values.\r\rLet $n(\\varepsilon,S_d)$ be the minimal number of information\revaluations needed to approximate $S_d$ to within\r$\\varepsilon\\in[0,1]$. We study \\emph{generalized tractability} by\rverifying when $n(\\varepsilon,S_d)$ can be bounded by a multiple of a\rpower of $T(\\varepsilon^{-1},d)$ for all\r$(\\varepsilon^{-1},d)\\in\\Omega \\subseteq[1,\\infty)\\times \\mathbb{N}$.  Here,\r$T$ is a \\emph{tractability} function which is non-decreasing in both\rvariables and grows slower than exponentially to infinity.  We study\rthe \\emph{exponent of tractability} which is the smallest power of\r$T(\\varepsilon^{-1},d)$ whose multiple bounds $n(\\varepsilon,S_d)$.\rWe also study \\emph{weak tractability}, i.e., when\r$\\lim_{\\varepsilon^{-1}+d\\to\\infty,(\\varepsilon^{-1},d)\\in\\Omega}\r\\ln\\,n(\\varepsilon,S_d)/(\\varepsilon^{-1}+d)=0$.\r \rIn our previous paper, we studied generalized tractability for proper\rsubsets $\\Omega$ of $[1,\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{N}$, whereas in this paper we\rtake the unrestricted domain $\\Omega^{\\rm unr}=[1,\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{N}$.\r\rWe consider the three cases for which we have only finitely many\rpositive singular values of $S_1$, or they decay exponentially or\rpolynomially fast. Weak tractability holds for these three cases, and\rfor all linear tensor product problems for which the singular values\rof $S_1$ decay slightly faster that logarithmically.  We provide\rnecessary and sufficient conditions on the function~$T$ such that\rgeneralized tractability holds. These conditions are obtained in terms\rof the singular values of $S_1$ and mostly limiting properties of $T$.\rThe tractability conditions tell us how fast $T$ must go to infinity.\rIt is known that $T$ must go to infinity faster than polynomially. We\rshow that generalized tractability is obtained for\r$T(x,y)=x^{1+\\ln\\,y}$. We also study tractability functions $T$ of\rproduct form, $T(x,y) =f_1(x)f_2(x)$. Assume that\r$a_i=\\liminf_{x\\to\\infty}(\\ln\\,\\ln f_i(x))/(\\ln\\,\\ln\\,x)$ is finite\rfor $i=1,2$.  Then generalized tractability takes place iff\r$$a_i>1 \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\  (a_1-1)(a_2-1)\\ge1,$$\rand if $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)=1$ then we need to assume one more condition\rgiven in the paper. If $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)>1$ then the exponent of\rtractability is zero, and if $(a_1-1)(a_2-1)=1$ then the exponent of\rtractability is finite. It is interesting to add that for $T$ being of\rthe product form, the tractability conditions as well as the exponent\rof tractability depend only on the second singular eigenvalue of $S_1$\rand they do \\emph{not} depend on the rate of their decay.\r\rFinally, we compare the results obtained in this paper for the\runrestricted domain $\\Omega^{\\rm unr}$ with the results from our\rprevious paper obtained for the restricted domain \r$\\Omega^{\\rm res}=\r[1,\\infty)\\times\\{1,2,\\dots,d^*\\}\\,\\cup\\,[1,\\varepsilon_0^{-1})\\times\\mathbb{N}$\rwith $d^*\\ge1$ and $\\varepsilon_0\\in(0,1)$. In general, the tractability \rresults are quite different. We may have generalized tractability\rfor the restricted domain and no generalized tractability for the\runrestricted domain which is the case, for instance, \rfor polynomial tractability $T(x,y)=xy$. We may also have generalized\rtractability for both domains with different or with the same\rexponents of tractability. \r\\end{document}                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Optimizing Frequency Queries for Data Mining Applications                                        Hassan Malik, John Kender                    2007-10-27                    Data mining algorithms use various Trie and bitmap-based representations to optimize the support (i.e., frequency) counting performance. In this paper, we compare the memory requirements and support counting performance of FP Tree, and Compressed Patricia Trie against several novel variants of vertical bit vectors. First, borrowing ideas from the VLDB domain, we compress vertical bit vectors using WAH encoding. Second, we evaluate the Gray code rank-based transaction reordering scheme, and show that in practice, simple lexicographic ordering, obtained by applying LSB Radix sort, outperforms this scheme.  \r\rLed by these results, we propose HDO, a novel Hamming-distance-based greedy transaction reordering scheme, and aHDO, a linear-time approximation to HDO. We present results of experiments performed on 15 common datasets with varying degrees of sparseness, and show that HDO- reordered, WAH encoded bit vectors can take as little as 5% of the uncompressed space, while aHDO achieves similar compression on sparse datasets. Finally, with results from over a billion database and data mining style frequency query executions, we show that bitmap-based approaches result in up to hundreds of times faster support counting, and HDO-WAH encoded bitmaps offer the best space-time tradeoff.

Multiple sets of documents are formed and analyzed to create multiple sets of frames. The overall procedure is wholly unsupervised and domain independent. The end result will be a collection of sets of semantic frames that will be useful in a wide range of applications, including question-answering, information extraction, summarization and  text generation.

This may be the result of flaws in the test cases themselves, assumptions made during the creation of test cases, or the infeasibility of testing the sheer number of possible configurations for a complex system. Testing approaches such as perpetual testing or continuous testing seek to continue to test these applications even after deployment, in hopes of finding any remaining flaws. In this paper, we present our initial work towards a testing methodology we call “in vivo testing”, in which unit tests are continuously executed inside a running application in the deployment environment. In this novel approach, unit tests execute within the current state of the program (rather than by creating a clean slate) without affecting or altering that state. Our approach has been shown to reveal defects both in the applications of interest and in the unit tests themselves. It can also be used for detecting concurrency or robustness issues that may not have appeared in a testing lab. Here we describe the approach, the testing framework we have developed for Java applications, classes of bugs our approach can discover, and the results of experiments to measure the added overhead.

In this paper, we present our experiences and observations from managing such an online software engineering course, and describe some of the specific challenges we faced, such as students’ aversion to using XP and difficulties in scheduling. We also present some suggestions to other educators who may face similar situations.

Stolfo, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2007-10-10                    There is a considerable body of literature and technology that\rprovides access control and security of communication for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) based on cryptographic authentication technologies\rand protocols. We introduce a new method of granting access and securing communication in a MANET environment to augment, not replace, existing techniques. Previous approaches grant access to the MANET, or to its services, merely by means of an authenticated identity or a qualified role. We present BARTER, a framework that, in addition, requires nodes to exchange a model of their behavior to grant access to the MANET\rand to assess the legitimacy of their subsequent communication. This framework forces the nodes not only to say who\ror what they are, but also how they behave. BARTER will continuously\rrun membership acceptance and update protocols to give access to and accept traffic only from nodes whose behavior model is considered ``normal'' according to the behavior model of the nodes in the MANET.\rWe implement and experimentally evaluate the merger between BARTER and other cryptographic technologies and show that BARTER can implement\ra fully distributed automatic access control and update with\rsmall cryptographic costs. Although the methods proposed involve the use of content-based anomaly detection models, the generic infrastructure\rimplementing the methodology may utilize any behavior model.\rEven though the experiments are implemented for MANETs, the idea\rof model exchange for access control can be applied to any type of network.

Locasto, Gabriela F. Cretu, Shlomo Hershkop, Angelos Stavrou                    2007-10-05                    Applying patches, although a disruptive activity, remains a vital part\rof software maintenance and defense. When host-based anomaly detection\r(AD) sensors monitor an application, patching the application requires\ra corresponding update of the sensor's behavioral model.  Otherwise,\rthe sensor may incorrectly classify new behavior as malicious (a false\rpositive) or assert that old, incorrect behavior is normal (a false\rnegative). Although the problem of ``model drift'' is an almost\runiversally acknowledged hazard for AD sensors, relatively little work\rhas been done to understand the process of re-training a ``live'' AD\rmodel --- especially in response to legal behavioral updates like\rvendor patches or repairs produced by a self-healing system.\r\rWe investigate the feasibility of automatically deriving and applying\ra ``model patch'' that describes the changes necessary to update a\r``reasonable'' host-based AD behavioral model ({\\it i.e.,} a model\rwhose structure follows the core design principles of existing\rhost--based anomaly models).  We aim to avoid extensive retraining and\rregeneration of the entire AD model when only parts may have changed\r--- a task that seems especially undesirable after the exhaustive\rtesting necessary to deploy a patch.

Bellovin, William R. Cheswick                    2007-09-25                    It is often necessary for two or more or more parties that do not\rfully trust each other to share data selectively.  For example,\rone intelligence agency might be willing to turn over certain\rdocuments to another such agency, but only if the second agency\rrequests the specific documents.  The problem, of course, is finding\rout that such documents exist when access to the database is\rrestricted.\r\rWe propose a search scheme based on Bloom filters and group ciphers\rsuch as Pohlig-Hellman encryption.  A semi-trusted third party can\rtransform one party's search queries to a form suitable for querying\rthe other party's database, in such a way that neither the third\rparty nor the database owner can see the original query.  Furthermore,\rthe encryption keys used to construct the Bloom filters are not\rshared with this third party.  Multiple providers and queriers are\rsupported; provision can be made for third-party ``warrant servers'',\ras well as ``censorship sets'' that limit the data to be shared.

GloServ classifies services in an\rontology and maps knowledge obtained by the ontology onto a\rscalable hybrid hierarchical peer-to-peer network. The network\rmirrors the semantic relationships of service classes and as a\rresult, reduces the number of message hops across the global\rnetwork due to the domain-specific way services are distributed.\rAlso, since services are described in greater detail, due to\rthe ontology representation, greater reasoning is applied when\rquerying and registering services. In this paper, we describe an\renhancement to the GloServ querying mechanism which allows\rGloServ servers to process and issue subqueries between servers\rof different classes. Thus, information about different service\rclasses may be queried for in a single query and issued directly\rfrom the front end, creating an extensible platform for service\rcomposition. The results are then aggregated and presented to the\ruser such that services which share an attribute are categorized\rtogether. We have built and evaluated a location-based web\rservice discovery prototype which demonstrates the flexibility\rof service composition in GloServ and discuss the design and\revaluation of this system.

According to this hypothesis, the prices of financial assets, such as stocks, incorporate all information that may affect their future performance. However, the translation of publicly\ravailable information into predictions of future performance is far from trivial. Making such predictions is the livelihood of stock traders, market analysts, and the like. Clearly, the efficient market hypothesis is only an approximation which ignores the cost of producing accurate predictions. \r\rMarkets are becoming more efficient and more accessible because of the use of ever faster methods for communicating and analyzing financial data. Algorithms developed in machine learning can be used to automate parts of this translation process. In other words, we can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of information and compile them to predict the performance of companies, stocks, or even market analysts. In financial terms, we would say that such algorithms discover inefficiencies in the current market. These discoveries can be used to make a profit and, in turn, reduce the market inefficiencies or support strategic planning processes.\r\rRelevance: Currently, the major stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ are transforming their markets into electronic financial markets. Players in these markets must process large amounts of information and make instantaneous investment decisions. \r\rMachine learning techniques help investors and corporations recognize new business opportunities or potential corporate problems in these markets. With time, these techniques help the financial market become better regulated and more stable. Also, corporations could save significant amount of resources if they can automate certain corporate finance functions such as planning and trading.\r\rResults: This dissertation offers a novel approach to using boosting as a predictive and interpretative tool for problems in finance. Even more, we demonstrate how boosting can support the automation of strategic planning and trading functions. \r\rMany of the recent bankruptcy scandals in publicly held US companies such as Enron and WorldCom are inextricably linked to the conflict of interest between shareholders (principals) and managers (agents). We evaluate this conflict in the case of Latin American and US companies. In the first part of this dissertation, we use Adaboost to analyze the impact of corporate governance variables on performance. In this respect, we present an algorithm that calculates alternating decision trees (ADTs), ranks variables according to their level of importance, and generates representative ADTs. We develop a board Balanced Scorecard (BSC) based on these representative ADTs which is part of the process to automate the planning functions. \r\rIn the second part of this dissertation we present three main algorithms to improve forecasting and automated trading. First, we introduce a link mining algorithm using a mixture of economic and social network indicators to forecast earnings surprises, and cumulative abnormal return. Second, we propose a trading algorithm for short-term technical trading. The algorithm was tested in the context of the Penn-Lehman Automated Trading Project (PLAT) competition using the Microsoft stock. The algorithm was profitable during the competition. Third, we present a multi-stock automated trading system that includes a machine learning algorithm that makes the prediction, a weighting algorithm that combines the experts, and a risk management layer that selects only the strongest prediction and avoids trading when there is a history of negative performance. This algorithm was tested with 100 randomly selected S&P 500 stocks. We find that even an efficient learning algorithm, such as boosting, still requires powerful control mechanisms in order to reduce unnecessary and unprofitable trades that increase transaction costs.

While image matching has attracted a great deal of attention in the computer vision community, it was never treated in a cryptographic sense.\r\rIn this paper we study the private version of the problem, oblivious image matching, and provide an efficient protocol for it.  In doing so, we design a novel image matching algorithm, and a few private protocols that may be of independent interest.  Specifically, we first show how to reduce the image matching problem to a two-level version of the fuzzy set matching problem, and then present a novel protocol to privately compute this (and several other) matching problems.

We believe that the main reason is not\rdisbelief in their ability to protect anonymity, but rather the\rpractical limitations in bandwidth and latency that stem from\rlimited participation. This limited participation, in turn, is due\rto a lack of incentives. We propose providing economic incentives,\rwhich historically have worked very well.\r\rIn this technical report, we demonstrate a payment scheme that can\rbe used to compensate nodes which provide anonymity in Tor, an\rexisting onion routing, anonymizing network. We show that current\ranonymous payment schemes are not suitable and  introduce a hybrid\rpayment system based on a combination of the Peppercoin Micropayment\rsystem and a new type of ``one use'' electronic cash. Our system\rclaims to maintain users' anonymity, although payment techniques\rmentioned previously --- when adopted individually --- provably\rfail.

Bellovin, Tal G. Malkin                    2007-09-12                    We present a reputation scheme for a pseudonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) system in an anonymous network.\rMisbehavior is one of the biggest problems in pseudonymous P2P systems, where there is little incentive for\rproper behavior. In our scheme, using ecash for reputation points, the reputation of each user is closely related to\rhis real identity rather than to his current pseudonym. Thus, our scheme allows an honest user to switch to a new\rpseudonym keeping his good reputation, while hindering a malicious user from erasing his trail of evil deeds with\ra new pseudonym.

Keromytis                    2007-09-07                    By exploiting the object-oriented dynamic composability of\rmodern document applications and formats, malcode hidden in otherwise\rinconspicuous documents can reach third-party applications that may\rharbor exploitable vulnerabilities otherwise unreachable by network-level service attacks. Such attacks can be very selective and difficult to detect compared to the typical network worm threat, owing to the complexity of these applications and data formats, as well as the multitude of document-exchange vectors. As a case study, this paper focuses on Microsoft Word documents as malcode carriers. We investigate the possibility of detecting embedded malcode in Word documents using two techniques: static content analysis using statistical models of typical document content, and run-time dynamic tests on diverse platforms. The experiments demonstrate these approaches can not only detect known malware, but also most zero-day attacks. We identify several problems with both approaches, representing both challenges in addressing the problem and opportunities for future research.

While much work has focused on the first two, there are very few tools that exist for interpreting the sometimes cryptic messages that result from runtime errors. Novice programmers in particular have difficulty dealing with uncaught exceptions in their code and the resulting stack traces, which are by no means easy to understand. We present Backstop, a tool for debugging runtime errors in Java applications. This tool provides more user-friendly error messages when an uncaught exception occurs, but also provides debugging support by allowing users to watch the execution of the program and the changes to the values of variables. We also present the results of two studies conducted on introductory-level programmers using the two different features of the tool.

However, developing such a benchmark is a non-trivial task given the many evaluation issues to be resolved, including but not limited to: quantifying the impacts\rof faults, analyzing various styles of healing (reactive, preventative, proactive), accounting for partially automated healing and accounting for incomplete/imperfect healing. We posit, however,that it is possible to realize a self-healing benchmark using a collection of analytical techniques and practical tools as building blocks. This paper highlights the flexibility of one analytical tool, the Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS) model, and illustrates its power and relevance\rto the problem of evaluating self-healing mechanisms/systems, when combined with practical tools for fault-injection.

We significantly extend previous work on BRDF editing for static scenes (with fixed lighting and view), by developing a precomputed polynomial representation that enables interactive BRDF editing with global illumination. Unlike previous recomputation based rendering techniques, the image is not linear in the BRDF when considering interreflections. We introduce a framework for precomputing a multi-bounce tensor of polynomial coefficients, that encapsulates the nonlinear nature of the task. Significant reductions in complexity are achieved by leveraging the low-frequency nature of indirect light. We use a high-quality representation for the BRDFs at the first bounce from the eye, and lower-frequency (often diffuse) versions for further bounces. This approximation correctly captures the general global illumination in a scene, including color-bleeding, near-field object reflections, and even caustics. We adapt Monte Carlo path tracing for precomputing the tensor of coefficients for BRDF basis functions. At runtime, the high-dimensional tensors can be reduced to a simple dot product at each pixel for rendering. We present a number of examples of editing BRDFs in complex scenes, with interactive feedback rendered with global illumination.

In the absence of sufficient real-world data, creating suitably large data sets for testing can be a difficult task. Random testing is one solution, but may have limited effectiveness in cases in which a reliable test oracle does not exist, as is the case of the machine learning applications of interest. To address this problem, we have developed an approach to creating data sets called “parameterized random data generation”. Our data generation framework allows us to isolate or combine different equivalence classes as desired, and then randomly generate large data sets using the properties of those equivalence classes as parameters. This allows us to take advantage of randomness but still have control over test case selection at the system testing level. We present our findings from using the approach to test two different machine learning ranking applications.

Nonetheless, popular applications such as Skype use\rTCP due to the deployment of NATs and firewalls that prevent UDP\rtraffic. This observation motivated us to study the delay\rperformance of TCP for real-time media flows using an analytical\rmodel and experiments. The results obtained yield the working region\rfor VoIP and live video streaming applications and guidelines for\rdelay-friendly TCP settings. Further, our research indicates that\rsimple application-level schemes, such as packet splitting and\rparallel connections, can significantly improve the delay\rperformance of real-time TCP flows.

Cretu, Angelos Stavrou, Slavatore J. Stolfo, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2007-05-30                    The efficacy of Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors depends\rheavily on the quality of the data used to train them. Arti-\rficial or contrived training data may not provide a realistic\rview of the deployment environment. Most realistic data\rsets are dirty; that is, they contain a number of attacks\ror anomalous events. The size of these high-quality training\rdata sets makes manual removal or labeling of attack\rdata infeasible. As a result, sensors trained on this data can\rmiss attacks and their variations. We propose extending the\rtraining phase of AD sensors (in a manner agnostic to the\runderlying AD algorithm) to include a sanitization phase.\rThis phase generates multiple models conditioned on small\rslices of the training data. We use these “micro-models”\rto produce provisional labels for each training input, and\rwe combine the micro-models in a voting scheme to determine\rwhich parts of the training data may represent attacks.\rOur results suggest that this phase automatically and significantly\rimproves the quality of unlabeled training data\rby making it as “attack-free” and “regular” as possible in\rthe absence of absolute ground truth. We also show how a\rcollaborative approach that combines models from different\rnetworks or domains can further refine the sanitization process\rto thwart targeted training or mimicry attacks against\ra single site.

In this paper we apply analytical\rtechniques based on Reliability, Availability and Serviceability\r(RAS) models to evaluate individual remediation\rmechanisms of select system components and their combined\reffects on the system. We demonstrate the applicability\rof RAS-models to the evaluation of self-healing systems\rby using them to analyze various styles of remediations (reactive,\rpreventative etc.), quantify the impact of imperfect\rremediations, identify sub-optimal (less effective) remediations\rand quantify the combined effects of all the activated\rremediations on the system as a whole.

However, companies\rthat sell digital content on-line are hesitant to rely on P2P \rmodels for paid content distribution due to the free file-sharing\rinherent in P2P models. \r\rIn this paper we present Aequitas, a P2P system in which users \rshare paid content anonymously via a layer of intermediate nodes.\rWe argue that with the extra anonymity in Aequitas, vendors\rcould leverage P2P bandwidth while effectively maintaining\rthe same level of trust towards their customers as in traditional \rmodels of paid content distribution. As a result, a \rcontent provider could reduce its infrastructure costs and \rsubsequently lower the costs for the end-users. \r\rThe intermediate nodes are \rincentivized to contribute their bandwidth via electronic micropayments. \rWe also introduce techniques that prevent the intermediate nodes\rfrom learning the content of the files they help transmit. \r\rIn this paper we present the design of our system, an analysis of its\rproperties and an implementation and experimental evaluation.  We\rquantify the value of the intermediate nodes, both in terms of\refficiency and their effect on anonoymity.  We argue in support of the\reconomic and technological merits of the system.

CPs such as\rApple iTunes that command a large base of paying users are hesitant to\ruse a P2P model that could easily degrade their user base into yet\ranother free file-sharing community.\r\rWe present TP2, a system that makes P2P file sharing a viable\rdelivery mechanism for paid digital content by providing the same\rsecurity properties as the currently used direct-download model.}\r introduces the novel notion of trusted auditors (TAs) -- P2P\rpeers that are controlled by the system operator. TAs monitor the\rbehavior of other peers and help detect and prevent formation of\rillegal file-sharing clusters among the CP's user base.  TAs both\rcomplement and exploit the strong authentication and authorization\rmechanisms that are used in TP2 to control access to content.  It\ris important to note that TP2 does not attempt to solve the\rout-of-band file-sharing or DRM problems, which also exist in the\rdirect-download systems currently in use.\r\rWe analyze TP2 by modeling it as a novel game between misbehaving\rusers who try to form unauthorized file-sharing clusters and TAs who\rcurb the growth of such clusters.  Our analysis shows that a small\rfraction of TAs is sufficient to protect the P2P system against\runauthorized file sharing.  In a system with as many as 60\\% of\rmisbehaving users, even a small fraction of TAs can detect 99\\% of\runauthorized cluster formation.  We developed a simple economic model\rto show that even with such a large fraction of malicious nodes,\rTP2 can improve CP's profits (which could translate to user\rsavings) by 62 to 122\\%, even while assuming conservative estimates of\rcontent and bandwidth costs.  We implemented TP2 as a layer on top\rof BitTorrent and demonstrated experimentally using PlanetLab that our\rsystem provides trusted P2P file sharing with negligible performance\roverhead.

Bellovin                    2007-03-21                    Firewalls are a effective means of protecting a local system or network of systems  from network-based security threats. In this paper, we propose a policy algebra  framework for security policy enforcement in hybrid firewalls, ones that exist both in the network and on end systems. To preserve the security semantics, the policy algebras  provide a formalism to compute addition, conjunction, subtraction, and summation on  rule sets; it also defines the cost and risk functions associated with policy enforcement.  Policy outsourcing triggers global cost minimization. We show that our framework can easily be extended to support packet filter firewall policies. Finally, we discuss special challenges and requirements for applying the policy algebra  framework to MANETs.

Latency-insensitive design (LID) has been proposed as \ra \"correct-by-construction\" design methodology to cope with this \rproblem. In this paper we present the design and implementation \rof a new and more efficient class of interface circuits to support \rLID.

These claims are supported by the \rexperimental results that we obtained completing semi-custom \rimplementations of the three designs with a 90nm industrial \rstandard-cell library. We also report on the formal verification \rof our design: using the NuSMV model checker we verified that \rthe RTL synthesizable implementations of our LID interface \rcircuits (relay stations and shells) are correct refinements of the corresponding abstract specifications according to the theory of \rLID [3].

However, numerous other demands are placed on computing systems besides speed. Current generation and next generation computing systems are expected\rto be reliable, highly available, easy to manage and able to repair faults and recover from failures with minimal human intervention.\rThe extra-functional requirements concerned with reliability, high availability, and serviceability (manageability, repair and recovery) represent an additional set of high-level goals the system is expected to meet or exceed. These goals govern the system’s operation and are codified using policies and service level agreements (SLAs).\rTo satisfy these extra-functional requirements, system-designers explore or employ a number of mechanisms geared towards improving the system’s reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) characteristics. However, to evaluate these mechanisms and their impact, we need something more than performance metrics.\r\rPerformance-measures are suitable for studying the feasibility of the mechanisms i.e. they can be used to conclude that the level of performance delivered by the system with these mechanisms\ractive does not preclude its usage. However, performance numbers convey little about the efficacy of the systems RAS-enhancing mechanisms. Further, they do not allow us to analyze the (expected or actual) impact of individual mechanisms or make comparisons/discuss tradeoffs\rbetween mechanisms. \r\rWhat is needed is an evaluation methodology that is able to analyze the details of the RAS-enhancing mechanisms – the micro-view as well as the high-level goals, expressed as policies, SLAs etc., governing the system’s operation – the macro-view. Further, we must establish a link\rbetween the details of the mechanisms and their impact on the high-level goals. This thesis is concerned with developing the tools and applying analytical techniques to enable this kind of evaluation. We make three contributions.\r\rFirst, we contribute to a suite of runtime fault-injection tools with Kheiron. Kheiron demonstrates a feasible, low-overhead, transparent approach to performing system-adaptations in a variety of execution environments at runtime. We use Kheiron’s runtime-adaptation capability to inject faults into running programs. We present three implementations of Kheiron, each targeting a different execution environment. Kheiron/C manipulates compiled C-programs running in an unmanaged execution environment – comprised of the operating system and the underlying\rprocessor. Kheiron/CLR manipulates programs running in Microsoft’s Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Kheiron/JVM manipulates programs running in Sun Microsystems’ Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kheiron’s operation is transparent to both the application and the execution\renvironment. Further, the overheads imposed by Kheiron on the application and the execution environment are negligible, <5%, when no faults are being injected.\r\rSecond, we describe analytical techniques based on RAS-models, represented as Markov chains and Markov reward models, to demonstrate their power in evaluating RAS-mechanisms and their impact on the high-level goals governing system-operation. We demonstrate the flexibility of these models in evaluating reactive, proactive and preventative mechanisms as well as their ability to explore the feasibility of yet-to-be-implemented mechanisms. Our analytical techniques focus on remediations rather than observed mean time to failures (MTTF). Unlike hardware, where the laws of physics govern the failure rates of mechanical and electrical parts, there\rare no such guarantees for software failure rates. Software failure-rates can however be influenced using fault-injection, which we employ in our experiments. In our analysis we consider a number\rof facets of remediations, which include, but go beyond mean time to recovery (MTTR). For example we consider remediation success rates, the (expected) impact of preventative-maintenance and the degradation-impact of remediations in our efforts to establish a framework for reasoning\rabout the tradeoffs (the costs versus the benefits) of various remediation mechanisms.\r\rFinally, we distill our experiences developing runtime fault-injection tools, performing fault-injection experiments and constructing and analyzing RAS-models into a 7-step process for evaluating\rcomputing systems – the 7U-evaluation methodology. Our evaluation method succeeds in establishing the link between the details of the low-level mechanisms and the high-level goals governing the system’s operation. It also highlights the role of environmental constraints and\rpolicies in establishing meaningful criteria for scoring and comparing these systems and their RAS-enhancing mechanisms.

Parekh                    2007-02-26                    Event correlation is a widely-used data processing methodology for a broad variety of applications, and is especially useful in the context of distributed monitoring for software faults and vulnerabilities. However, most existing solutions have typically been focused on \"intra-organizational\" correlation; organizations typically employ privacy policies that prohibit the exchange of information outside of the organization. At the same time, the promise of \"inter-organizational\" correlation is significant given the broad availability of Internet-scale communications, and its potential role in both software fault maintenance and software vulnerability detection.\r\rIn this thesis, I present a framework for reconciling these opposing forces via the use of privacy preservation integrated into the event processing framework. I introduce the notion of event corroboration, a reduced yet flexible form of correlation that enables collaborative verification, without revealing sensitive information. By accommodating privacy policies, we enable the corroboration of data across different organizations without actually releasing sensitive information. The framework supports both source anonymity and data privacy, yet allows for temporal corroboration of a broad variety of data. The framework is designed as a lightweight collection of components to enable integration with existing COTS platforms and distributed systems. I also present an implementation of this framework: Worminator, a collaborative Intrusion Detection System, based on an earlier platform, XUES (XML Universal Event Service), an event processor used as part of a software monitoring platform called KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme).\r\rKX comprised a series of components, connected together with a publish-subscribe content-based routing event subsystem, for the autonomic software monitoring, reconfiguration, and repair of complex distributed systems. Sensors were installed in legacy systems; XUES' two modules then performed event processing on sensor data: information was collected and processed by the Event Packager, and correlated using the Event Distiller. While XUES itself was not privacy-preserving, it laid the groundwork for this thesis by supporting event typing, the use of publish-subscribe and extensibility support via pluggable event transformation modules. I also describe techniques by which corroboration and privacy preservation could optionally be \"retrofitted\" onto XUES without breaking the correlation applications and scenarios described.\r\rWorminator is a ground-up rewrite of the XUES platform to fully support privacy-preserving event types and algorithms in the context of a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), whereby sensor alerts can be exchanged and corroborated without revealing sensitive information about a contributor's network, services, or even external sources, as required by privacy policies. Worminator also fully anonymizes source information, allowing contributors to decide their preferred level of information disclosure. Worminator is implemented as a monitoring framework on top of a collection of non-collaborative COTS and in-house IDS sensors, and demonstrably enables the detection of not only worms but also \"broad and stealthy\" scans; traditional single-network sensors either bury such scans in large volumes or miss them entirely. Worminator supports corroboration for packet and flow headers (metadata), packet content, and even aggregate models of network traffic using a variety of techniques.\r\rThe contributions of this thesis include the development of a cross-application-domain event processing framework with native privacy-preserving types, the use and validation of privacy-preserving corroboration, and the establishment of a practical deployed collaborative security system. The thesis also quantifies Worminator's effectiveness at attack detection, the overhead of privacy preservation and the effectiveness of our approach against adversaries, be they \"honest-but-curious\" or actively malicious.

Our work exhibits several important properties that include: (1) routing decisions are made locally by network nodes without the centralized information of the entire network topology, (2) routing decisions minimize throughput loss under a single-link attack with respect to\rdifferent session models, and (3) routing decisions address multiple link attacks via lexicographic optimization. We devise two algorithms\rtermed the {\\em Bound-Control algorithm} and the {\\em Lex-Control algorithm}, both of which provide provably optimal solutions.  Experiments show that the Bound-Control algorithm is more effective to prevent the worst-case single-link attack when compared to the single-path approach, and that the Lex-Control algorithm further enhances the Bound-Control algorithm by countering severe single-link attacks and various types of multi-link attacks. Moreover, the Lex-Control algorithm offers prominent protection after only a few execution rounds, implying that we can sacrifice minimal routing\rprotection for significantly improved algorithm performance.  Finally, we examine the applicability of our proposed algorithms in a specialized\rdefensive network architecture called the attack-resistant network and analyze how the algorithms address resiliency and security in different network settings.

Our system integrates\rthree data sources: the International HapMap project, whole-genome\rmarker correlation data and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man\r(OMIM) database. It accepts SNP data of individuals as query input\rand delivers disease susceptibility hypotheses even if the original set\rof typed SNPs is incomplete. Our system is scalable and flexible: it\roperates in real time and can be configured on the fly to produce\rpopulation, technology, and confidence-specific predictions.\rAvailability: Efforts are underway to deploy our system as part of the\rNCBI Reference Assembly.

Cretu, Angelos Stavrou, Salvatore J. Stolfo, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2007-02-15                    Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors have become an invaluable\rtool for forensic analysis and intrusion detection.\rUnfortunately, the detection performance of all\rlearning-based ADs depends heavily on the quality of the\rtraining data. In this paper, we extend the training phase\rof an AD to include a sanitization phase. This phase significantly\rimproves the quality of unlabeled training data\rby making them as ”attack-free” as possible in the absence\rof absolute ground truth. Our approach is agnostic\rto the underlying AD, boosting its performance based\rsolely on training-data sanitization. Our approach is to\rgenerate multiple AD models for content-based AD sensors\rtrained on small slices of the training data. These\rAD “micro-models” are used to test the training data,\rproducing alerts for each training input. We employ voting\rtechniques to determine which of these training items\rare likely attacks. Our preliminary results show that sanitization\rincreases 0-day attack detection while in most\rcases reducing the false positive rate. We analyze the performance\rgains when we deploy sanitized versus unsanitized\rAD systems in combination with expensive hostbased\rattack-detection systems. Finally, we show that\rour system incurs only an initial modest cost, which can\rbe amortized over time during online operation.

Zeroconf can be used in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks which are based on IEEE 802.11 and IP. However, Zeroconf has problems in mobile ad-hoc networks as it cannot detect changes in the network topology. In highly mobile networks, Zeroconf causes network overhead while discovering new services. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to accelerate service discovery for mobile ad-hoc networks. Our algorithm involves the monitoring of network interface changes that occur when a device with IEEE 802.11 enabled joins a new network area. This algorithm allows users to discover network topology changes and new services in real-time while minimizing network overhead.

Cretu, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2007-02-10                    Most computer defense systems crash the process that they protect as\rpart of their response to an attack.  In contrast, self-healing\rsoftware recovers from an attack by automatically repairing the\runderlying vulnerability. Although recent research explores the\rfeasibility of the basic concept, self-healing faces four major\robstacles before it can protect legacy applications and COTS\rsoftware. Besides the practical issues involved in applying the system\rto such software (<i>e.g.</i>, not modifying source code), self-healing\rhas encountered a number of problems: knowing when to engage, knowing\rhow to repair, and handling communication with external entities.\r<p>\rOur previous work on a self-healing system, STEM, left these\rchallenges as future work.  STEM provides self-healing by\rspeculatively executing ``slices'' of a process. This paper improves\rSTEM's capabilities along three lines: (1) applicability of the\rsystem to COTS software (STEM does not require source code, and it\rimposes a roughly 73% performance penalty on Apache's normal\roperation), (2) semantic correctness of the repair (we introduce\r<i>virtual proxies</i> and <i>repair policy</i> to assist the healing\rprocess), and (3) creating a behavior profile based on aspects of\rdata and control flow.

Previous works have addressed the problem of LIS performance in different ways.  In particular, the insertion of relay stations and the sizing of the input queues in the shells are the two main optimization techniques that have been proposed.\rWe provide a unifying framework for this problem by outlining which approaches work for different system topologies, and highlighting counterexamples where some solutions do not work.  We also observe that in the most difficult class of topologies, instances with the greatest throughput degradation are typically very amenable to simplifications. The contributions of this paper include a characterization of topologies that maintain optimal throughput with fixed-size queues and a heuristic for sizing queues that produces solutions close to optimal in a fraction of the time.

Locasto, Angelos Stavrou, Angelos D. Keromytis, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2007-02-04                    POlymorphic malcode remains one of the most troubling threats for information security and intrusion defense systems. The ability for malcode to be automatically transformed into a semantically equivalent variant frustrates attemtps to construct a single, simple, easily verifiable representation. We present a quantitative analysis of the strentghs and limitations of shellcode polymorphism and consider the impact of this analysis on the current practices in intrusion detection.\r\rOur examination focuses on the nature of shellcode \"decoding routines\", and the empirical evidence we gather illustrate our mail result: that the challenge of modeling the class of self-modifying code is  likely intractable - even when the size of the instruction sequence (i.e. the decoder) is relatively small. We develop metrics to gauge the power of polymorphic engines and use them to provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of some popular engines. We believe this analysis supplies a novel and useful way to understand the limitations of the current generation of signature-based techniques. We analyze some contemporary polymorphic techniques, explore ways to improve them in order to forecast the nature of future threats, and present our suggestions for countermeasures. Our resulsts indicate that the class of polymorphic behavior is too greatly spread and varied to model effectively. We conclude that modeling normal content is ulatimately a more promising defense mechanism than modeling malicious or abnormal content.

The underlying service discovery\rarchitecture used is GloServ. GloServ uses the Web Ontology Language\r(OWL) to classify services in an ontology and map knowledge obtained\rby the ontology onto a hierarchical peer-to-peer network. Initially,\ran ontology-based first order predicate logic query is issued in order\rto route the query to the appropriate server and to obtain exact and\rrelated service data.  Text search further enhances querying by\rallowing services to be described not only with ontology attributes,\rbut with plain text so that users can query for them using key\rwords. Currently, querying is limited to either simple attribute-value\rpair searches, ontology queries or text search. Combining ontology\rqueries with text search enhances current service discovery\rmechanisms.

Cretu, Angelos Stavrou, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2007-01-20                    Many users value applications that continue execution in the face of\rattacks. Current software protection techniques typically abort a\rprocess after an intrusion attempt ({\\it e.g.}, a code injection\rattack). We explore ways in which the security property of integrity\rcan support availability. We extend the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model\rto provide primitives and rules for specifying and enforcing repair\rmechanisms and validation of those repairs. Users or administrators\rcan use this model to write or automatically synthesize \\emph{repair\rpolicy}.  The policy can help customize an application's response to\rattack.  We describe two prototype implementations for transparently\rapplying these policies without modifying source code.

In particular, a shell stalls a pearl whenever new valid data are not available on its input channels. We study how functional independence \rconditions (FIC) can be applied to the performance optimization of a latency-insensitive system by avoiding unnecessary stalling of their pearls. We present a novel circuit design of a generic shell template that can exploit FICs. We also provide an automatic procedure for the logic synthesis of a shell instance that is only based on the particular local characteristics of its corresponding pearl and does not require any input from the designers. We conclude reporting on a set of experimental results that illustrate the beneits and overhead of the proposed technique.

They look to the Java community, where these needs are being met with language enhancements, improved developer tools and middleware, and better runtime support. We present a business case for why Microsoft should give priority to supporting better modularization techniques, also known as advanced separation of concerns (ASOC), for the .NET platform, and we provide a roadmap for how to do so.

The multiprocessor architectures being\rdeveloped will have a major impact on existing software. Current\rlanguages provide facilities for concurrent and distributed\rprogramming, but are prone to races and non-determinism. SHIM, a\rdeterministic concurrent language, guarantees the behavior of its\rprograms are independent of the scheduling of concurrent\roperations. The language currently supports atomic arrays only, i.e.,\rparts of arrays cannot be sent to concurrent processes for evaluation\r(and edition). In this report, we propose a way to add non-atomic\rarrays to SHIM and describe the semantics that should be considered\rwhile allowing concurrent processes to edit parts of the same array.

Recent approaches used frequent itemsets and closed frequent itemsets to reduce dimensionality, and to improve the efficiency of hierarchical document clustering. In this paper, we introduce the notion of “closed interesting” itemsets (i.e. closed itemsets with high interestingness). We provide heuristics such as “super item” to efficiently mine these itemsets and show that they provide significant dimensionality reduction over closed frequent itemsets. \r\rUsing “closed interesting” itemsets, we propose a new hierarchical document clustering method that outperforms state of the art agglomerative, partitioning and frequent-itemset based methods both in terms of FScore and Entropy, without requiring dataset specific parameter tuning. We evaluate twenty interestingness measures on nine standard datasets and show that when used to generate “closed interesting” itemsets, and to select parent nodes, Mutual Information, Added Value, Yule’s Q and Chi-Square offers best clustering performance, regardless of the characteristics of underlying dataset. We also show that our method is more scalable, and results in better run-time performance as compare to leading approaches. On a dual processor machine, our method scaled sub-linearly and was able to cluster 200K documents in about 40 seconds.

Keromytis                    2006-12-15                    We introduce LinkWidth, a method for estimating capacity and\ravailable bandwidth using single-end controlled TCP packet probes.\rTo estimate capacity, we generate a train of TCP RST packets “sandwiched” between two TCP SYN packets. Capacity is obtained by\rend-to-end packet dispersion of the received TCP RST/ACK packets corresponding to the TCP SYN packets. Our technique is significantly different from the rest of the packet-pair-based measurement techniques, such as CapProbe, pathchar and pathrate, because the long packet trains minimize errors due to bursty cross-traffic. TCP RST packets do not generate additional ICMP replies preventing cross-traffic interference with our probes. In addition, we use TCP packets for all our probes to prevent some types of QoS-related traffic shaping from affecting our measurements. We extend the Train of Packet Pairs technique to approximate the available link capacity. We use pairs of TCP packets with variable intra-pair delays and sizes. This is the first attempt to implement this technique using single-end TCP probes, tested on a wide range of real networks with variable cross-traffic. We compare our prototype with pathchirp and pathload, which require control of both\rends, and demonstrate that in most cases our method gives approximately the same results.

Due to their focus on problem detection, diagnosis and remediation any evaluation methodology should facilitate an objective evaluation and/or comparison of these activities. Measures of “raw” performance are easily quantified and hence facilitate measurement and comparison on the basis of numbers. However, classifying a system better at problem detection, diagnosis and remediation purely on the basis of performance measures is not useful. The proposed evaluation methodology devised will differ from traditional benchmarks, which are primarily concerned with measures of performance. In order to develop this methodology we rely on a set of experiments which will enable us to compare the self-healing capabilities of one system versus another. As currently we do not have available “real” self-healing systems, we will simulate the behavior of some target self-healing systems, system faults and the operational and repair activities of target systems. Further, we will use the results derived from the simulation experiments to answer questions relevant to the utility of a benchmark report.

In the first part of the project, DNS server replica counts and maximum DNS server separation are found for each domain. In the second part, these domains are queried for a one-month period in order to find their uptime percentages.

Forte, Henning Schulzrinne                    2006-12-07                    In a wireless network, mobile nodes (MNs) repeatedly\rperform tasks such as layer 2 (L2) handoff, layer 3 (L3)\rhandoff and authentication. These tasks are critical, particularly\rfor real-time applications such as VoIP. We propose a novel\rapproach, namely Cooperative Roaming (CR), in which MNs\rcan collaborate with each other and share useful information\rabout the network in which they move.\rWe show how we can achieve seamless L2 and L3 handoffs\rregardless of the authentication mechanism used and without any\rchanges to either the infrastructure or the protocol. In particular,\rwe provide a working implementation of CR and show how, with\rCR, MNs can achieve a total L2+L3 handoff time of less than\r16 ms in an open network and of about 21 ms in an IEEE 802.11i\rnetwork. We consider behaviors typical of IEEE 802.11 networks,\ralthough many of the concepts and problems addressed here\rapply to any kind of mobile network.

In this paper, using a general physical channel model, we develop an allocation algorithm for log-utility fairness. To maximize the aggregate utility, our algorithm determines channel access attempt probabilities of nodes using partial derivatives of the utility. Our algorithm is verified through extended simulations. The results indicate that our algorithm could quickly\rachieve allocations close to the optimum with 8.6% accuracy error on average.

Keromytis                    2006-11-28                    P2P file sharing provides a powerful content distribution model\rby leveraging users' computing and bandwidth resources.  However,\rcompanies have been reluctant to rely on P2P systems for paid content\rdistribution due to their inability to limit the exploitation of these\rsystems for free file sharing.  We present \\sname, a system that\rcombines the more cost-effective and scalable distribution capabilities of\rP2P systems with a level of trust and control over content\rdistribution similar to direct download content delivery networks.  \\sname\\\ruses two key mechanisms that can be layered on top of existing P2P\rsystems.  First, it provides strong authentication to prevent free\rfile sharing in the system.  Second, it introduces a new notion of trusted\rauditors to detect and limit malicious attempts to gain information\rabout participants in the system to facilitate additional out-of-band\rfree file sharing.  We analyze \\sname\\ by modeling it as a novel game\rbetween malicious users who try to form free file sharing clusters\rand trusted auditors who curb the growth of such clusters.  Our analysis\rshows that a small fraction of trusted auditors\ris sufficient to protect the P2P system against unauthorized file\rsharing.  Using a simple economic model, we further show that\r\\sname\\ provides a more cost-effective content distribution solution,\rresulting in higher profits for a content provider even in the\rpresence of a large percentage of malicious users.  Finally, we\rimplemented \\sname\\ on top of BitTorrent and use PlanetLab to show\rthat our system can provide trusted P2P f                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Presence Traffic Optimization Techniques                                        Vishal Singh, Henning Schulzrinne, Markus Isomaki, Piotr Boni                    2006-11-02                    With the growth of presence-based services, it is important to provision the network to support high traffic and load generated by presence services. Presence event distribution systems amplify a single incoming PUBLISH message into possibly numerous outgoing NOTIFY messages from the server. This can increase the network load on inter-domain links and can potentially disrupt other QoS-sensitive applications. In this document, we present existing as well as new techniques that can be used to reduce presence traffic both in inter-domain and intra-domain scenarios. Specifically, we propose two new techniques: sending common NOTIFY for multiple watchers and batched notifications. We also propose some generic heuristics that can be used to reduce network traffic due to presence.

We also show a case study on how VSPs can use this mechanism for\ridentity and topology hiding in VoIP peering.

It plays an increasingly\rimportant role as the bridge between Internet and traditional\rtelecommunications services. ENUM is based on the Domain Name System\r(DNS), but places unique performance requirements on DNS server. In\rparticular, ENUM server needs to host a huge number of records,\rprovide high query throughput for both existing and non-existing\rrecords in the server, maintain high query performance under update\rload, and answer queries within a tight latency budget. In this\rreport, we evaluate and compare performance of serving ENUM queries by\rthree servers, namely BIND, PDNS and Navitas. Our objective is to\ranswer whether and how these servers can meet the unique performance\rrequirements of ENUM.  Test results show that the ENUM query response\rtime on our platform has always been on the order of a few\rmilliseconds or less, so this is likely not a concern. Throughput then\rbecomes the key.  The throughput of BIND degrades linearly as the\rrecord set size grows, so BIND is not suitable for ENUM. PDNS delivers\rhigher performance than BIND in most cases, while the commercial\rNavitas server presents even better ENUM performance than PDNS. Under\rour 5M-record set test, Navitas server with its default configuration\rconsumes one tenth to one sixth the memory of PDNS, achieves six times\rhigher throughput for existing records and an order of two magnitudes\rhigher throughput for non-existing records than the bottom line PDNS\rserver without caching.  The throughput of Navitas is also the highest\ramong the tested servers when the database is being updated in the\rbackground. We investigated ways to improve PDNS performance. For\rexample, doubling CPU processing power by putting PDNS and its backend\rdatabase in two separate machines can increase PDNS throughput for\rexisting records by 45% and that for nonexisting records by 40%. Since\rPDNS is open source, we also instrumented the source code to obtain a\rdetailed profile of contributions of various systems components to the\roverall latency.  We found that when the server is within its normal\rload range, the main component of server processing latency is caused\rby backend database lookup operations.  Excessive number of backend\rdatabase lookups is the reason that makes PDNS throughput for\rnon-existing records its key weakness. We studied using PDNS caching\rto reduce the number of database lookups. With a full packet cache and\ra modified cache maintenance mechanism, the PDNS throughput for\rexisting records can be improved by 100%. This brings the value to one\rthird of its Navitas counterpart. After enabling the PDNS negative\rquery cache, we improved PDNS throughput for non-existing records to\rthe level comparable to its throughput for existing records, but this\rresult is still an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding\rvalue in Navitas. Further improvements of PDNS throughput for\rnon-existing records will require optimization of related processing\rmechanism in its implementation.

Edwards                    2006-09-22                    We address the problem of specifying concurrent processes that can make local\rnondeterministic decisions without affecting global system\rbehavior---the sequence of events communicated along each\rinter-process communication channel.  Such nondeterminism can be used\rto cope with unpredictable execution rates and communication delays.\r\rOur model\rresembles Kahn's, but does not include unbounded buffered\rcommunication, so it is much simpler to reason about and implement.\rAfter formally characterizing these so-called confluent processes, we\rpropose a collection of operators, including sequencing, parallel, and\rour own creation, confluent choice, that guarantee confluence by\rconstruction.\r\rThe result is a set of primitive constructs that form the formal basis\rof a concurrent programming language for both hardware and software\rsystems that gives deterministic behavior regardless of the relative\rexecution rates of the processes.  Such a language greatly simplifies\rthe verification task because any correct implementation of such a\rsystem is guaranteed to have the same behavior, a property rarely\rfound in concurrent programming environments.

Edwards                    2006-09-22                    Nondeterminism is a central challenge in most concurrent models of\rcomputation.  That programmers must worry about races and other\rtiming-dependent behavior is a key reason that parallel programming\rhas not been widely adopted.  The SHIM concurrent language,\rintended for hardware/software codesign applications, avoids this\rproblem by providing deterministic (race-free) concurrency, but does\rnot support automatic parallelization of sequential algorithms.\r\rIn this paper, we present a compiler able to parallelize a simple\rMATLAB-like language into concurrent SHIM processes.  From a\ruser-provided partitioning of arrays to processes, our compiler\rdivides the program into coarse-grained processes and schedules and\rsynthesizes inter-process communication.  We demonstrate the\reffectiveness of our approach on some image-processing algorithms.

Edwards                    2006-09-21                    Concurrent programming languages should be a good fit for embedded\rsystems because they match the intrinsic parallelism of their\rarchitectures and environments.  Unfortunately, most concurrent\rprogramming formalisms are prone to races and nondeterminism, despite\rthe presence of mechanisms such as monitors.\r\rIn this paper, we propose SHIM, the core of a concurrent language with\rdisciplined shared variables that remains deterministic, meaning the\rbehavior of a program is independent of the scheduling of concurrent\roperations. SHIM does not sacrifice power or flexibility to achieve\rthis determinism. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous\rparadigms---loosely and tightly synchronized threads---the dynamic\rcreation of threads and shared variables, recursive procedures, and\rexceptions.\r\rWe illustrate our programming model with examples including\rbreadth-first-search algorithms and pipelines. By construction, they\rare race-free. We provide the formal semantics of SHIM and a\rpreliminary implementation.

Nevertheless, many AOP systems lack adequate support for debugging, making it difficult to diagnose faults and understand the program's structure and control flow.  We discuss why debugging aspect behavior is hard and how harvesting results from related research on debugging optimized code can make the problem more tractable.  We also specify general debugging criteria that we feel all AOP systems should support.\r\rWe present a novel solution to the problem of debugging aspect-enabled programs.  Our Wicca system is the first dynamic AOP system to support full source-level debugging of woven code.  It introduces a new weaving strategy that combines source weaving with online byte-code patching.  Changes to the aspect rules, or base or aspect source code are rewoven and recompiled on-the-fly.  We present the results of an experiment that show how these features provide the programmer with a powerful interactive debugging experience with relatively little overhead.

Assuming all nodes interfere with each other, completely or partially, log-utility fairness significantly enhances the total throughput compared to max-min fairness since the nodes should have the same throughput in max-min fairness. The improvement is enlarged especially when the effect of cumulated interference from multiple senders cannot be ignored.

In this paper, using a general physical channel model, we develop the equation for the optimal attemp rate to maximize the aggregate log utility. We use the least squares method to approximate the equation to a linear function of the attempt rate. Our analysis on the approximation error shows that the linear function obtained is close enough to the original with the square of the residuals more than 0.9.

Werschulz                    2006-07-27                    In a previous paper, we developed a general framework for establishing\rtractability and strong tractability for quasilinear multivariate\rproblems in the worst case setting.  One important example of such a\rproblem is the solution of the heat equation $u_t = \\Delta u - qu$ in\r$I^d\\times(0,T)$, where $I$ is the unit interval and $T$ is a maximum\rtime value.  This problem is to be solved subject to homogeneous\rDirichlet boundary conditions, along with the initial conditions\r$u(\\cdot,0)=f$ over~$I^d$.  The solution~$u$ depends linearly on~$f$,\rbut nonlinearly on~$q$.  Here, both $f$ and~$q$ are $d$-variate\rfunctions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with finite-order\rweights of order~$\\omega$.  This means that, although~$d$ can be\rarbitrary large, $f$ and~$q$ can be decomposed as sums of functions of\rat most $\\omega$~variables, with $\\omega$ independent of~$d$.\r\rIn this paper, we apply our previous general results to the heat\requation.  We study both the absolute and normalized error criteria.\rFor either error criterion, we show that the problem is \\emph.  That\ris, the number of evaluations of $f$ and~$q$ needed to obtain an\r$\\varepsilon$-approximation is polynomial in~$\\varepsilon$ and~$d$,\rwith the degree of the polynomial depending linearly on~$\\omega$.  In\raddition, we want to know when the problem is \\emph{strongly\rtractable}, meaning that the dependence is polynomial only\rin~$\\varepsilon$, independently of~$d$.  We show that if the sum of\rthe weights defining the weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert space is\runiformly bounded in~$d$ and the integral of the univariate kernel is\rpositive, then the heat equation is strongly tractable.

Nayar, Vijay N. Anand                    2006-07-25                    In this paper, we present a new class of volumetric displays that can\rbe used to display 3D objects. The basic approach is to trade-off the\rspatial resolution of a digital projector (or any light engine) to gain\rresolution in the third dimension. Rather than projecting an image\ronto a 2D screen, a depth-coded image is projected onto a 3D cloud\rof passive optical scatterers. The 3D point cloud is realized using a\rtechnique called Laser Induced Damage (LID), where each scatterer\ris a physical crack embedded in a block of glass or plastic. We show\rthat when the point cloud is randomized in a specific manner, a very\rlarge fraction of the points are visible to the viewer irrespective of\rhis/her viewing direction. We have developed an orthographic projection\rsystem that serves as the light engine for our volumetric displays.\rWe have implemented several types of point clouds, each one\rdesigned to display a specific class of objects. These include a cloud\rwith uniquely indexable points for the display of true 3D objects, a\rcloud with an independently indexable top layer and a dense extrusion\rvolume to display extruded objects with arbitrarily textured top\rplanes and a dense cloud for the display of purely extruded objects.\rIn addition, we show how our approach can be used to extend simple\rvideo games to 3D. Finally, we have developed a 3D avatar in which\rvideos of a face with expression changes are projected onto a static\rsurface point cloud of the face.

We study constraint formalisms for\rexpressing user preferences as base facts in a partial order.  We\rconsider a language that allows comparison and a limited form of\rarithmetic, and show that the transitive closure computation required\rto complete the partial order terminates.  We consider various ways of\rcomposing partial orders from smaller pieces, and provide results on\rthe size of the resulting transitive closures.  We introduce the\rnotion of ``covering composition,'' which solves some semantic problems\rapparent in previous notions of composition.  Finally, we show how\rpreference queries within our language can be supported by suitable\rindex structures for efficient evaluation over large data sets.  Our\rresults provide guidance about when complex preferences can be\refficiently evaluated, and when they cannot.

A growing number\rof VoIP service providers such as Skype, Vonage, Broadvoice, as well\ras many cable services are using the Internet to offer telephone\rservices at much lower costs.  However, VoIP services rely on the\ruser's Internet connection, and this can often translate into lower\rquality communication.  Overlay networks offer a potential solution to\rthis problem by improving the default Internet routing and overcome\rfailures.\r\rTo assess the feasibility of using overlays to improve VoIP\ron the Internet, we have conducted a detailed experimental study to\revaluate the benefits of using an overlay on PlanetLab nodes for\rimproving voice communication connectivity and performance around the\rworld.  Our measurements demonstrate that an overlay architecture\rcan significantly improve VoIP communication across most regions\rand provide their greatest benefit for locations with poorer default\rInternet connectivity.  We explore overlay topologies and show that a\rsmall number of well-connected intermediate nodes is sufficient to\rimprove VoIP performance.  We show that there is significant\rvariation over time in the best overlay routing paths and argue for\rthe need for adaptive routing to account for this variation to deliver\rthe best performance.

These methods separate the\rscene’s static and dynamic components allowing the static portion to be computed as a\rpreprocess. In this work, we hold geometry static and allow either the lighting or BRDF\rto be dynamic. To achieve real-time performance, both static and dynamic components\rare compressed by exploiting spatial and angular coherence. Temporal coherence of the\rdynamic component from frame to frame is an important, but unexplored additional form\rof coherence. In this thesis, we explore temporal coherence of two forms of all-frequency\rPRT: BRDF material editing and lighting design. We develop incremental methods for\rapproximating the differences in the dynamic component between consecutive frames. For\rBRDF editing, we find that a pure incremental approach allows quick convergence to an\rexact solution with smooth real-time response.\rFor relighting, we observe vastly differing degrees of temporal coherence accross levels of\rthe lighting’s wavelet hierarchy. To address this, we develop an algorithm that treats each\rlevel separately, adapting to available coherence. The proposed methods are othogonal to\rother forms of coherence, and can be added to almost any PRT algorithm with minimal\rimplementation, computation, or memory overhead. We demonstrate our technique within\rexisting codes for nonlinear wavelet approximation, changing view with BRDF factorization,\rand clustered PCA. Exploiting temporal coherence of dynamic lighting yields a 3×–4× per-\rformance improvement, e.g., all-frequency effects are achieved with 30 wavelet coefficients,\rabout the same as low-frequency spherical harmonic methods. Distinctly, our algorithm\rsmoothly converges to the exact result within a few frames of the lighting becoming static.

In an effort to\rovercome these obstacles, systems often incorporate self-monitoring\rand self-healing functionality. Our hypothesis is that internal\rmonitoring is not an effective long-term strategy.  However,\rmonitoring mechanisms that are completely external lose the advantage\rof application-specific knowledge available to an inline monitor. To\rbalance these tradeoffs, we present the design of VxF, an environment\rwhere both supervision and automatic remediation can take place by\rspeculatively executing \"slices\" of an application. VxF introduces\rthe concept of an endolithic kernel by providing execution as\ran operating system service: execution of a process slice takes place\rinside a kernel thread rather than directly on the system\rmicroprocessor.

Packet payload sharing techniques hold far more promise, as they can convey exploit vectors and/or malcode used upon successful exploit of a target system, irrespective of obfuscated source addresses.  However, payload sharing has had minimal success due to regulatory or business-based privacy concerns of transmitting raw or even sanitized payloads. The currently accepted form of content exchange has been limited to the exchange of known-suspicious content, e.g., packets captured by honeypots; however, signature generation assumes that each site receives enough traffic in order to correlate a meaningful set of payloads from which common content can be derived, and places fundamental and computationally stressful requirements on signature generators that may miss particularly stealthy or carefully-crafted polymorphic malcode.\r\rInstead, we propose a new approach to enable the sharing of suspicious payloads via privacy-preserving technologies. We detail the work we have done with two example payload anomaly detectors, PAYL and Anagram, to support generalized payload correlation and signature generation without releasing identifiable payload data and without relying on single-site signature generation. We present preliminary results of our approaches and suggest how such deployments may practically be used for not only cross-site, but also cross-domain alert sharing and its implications for profiling threats.

It is a configurable policy in the sense that a tunable parameter is provided to change its behavior. With different settings of the parameter, this policy  can emulate the first-come first-serve, the processing sharing, or the feedback policies, as well as different levels of their mixtures. This policy is implemented in the Linux kernel as a replacement of the default scheduler. The drastic changes of behaviors as the parameter changes are analyzed and simulated. Its performance is measured with the real systems by the workload generators and benchmarks.

Gradients\rare well suited for analyzing the intricate combination of appearance\reffects, since each gradient term corresponds directly to variation in\ra specific factor.  First, we show how the spatial {\\em and}\rdirectional gradients of the light field change, as light interacts\rwith curved objects.  This extends the recent frequency analysis of\rDurand et al.\\ to gradients, and has many advantages for operations,\rlike bump-mapping, that are difficult to analyze in the\rFourier domain.  Second, we consider the individual terms responsible\rfor shading gradients, such as lighting variation, convolution with\rthe surface BRDF, and the object's curvature.  This analysis indicates\rthe relative importance of various terms, and shows precisely how they\rcombine in shading.  As one practical application, our theoretical\rframework can be used to adaptively sample images in high-gradient\rregions for efficient rendering.  Third, we understand the effects of\rsoft shadows, computing accurate visibility gradients.  We generalize\rprevious work to arbitrary curved occluders, and develop a \rlocal framework that is easy to integrate with conventional\rray-tracing methods.  Our visibility gradients can be directly used in\rpractical gradient interpolation methods for efficient rendering.

Cretu, Angelos D. Keromytis, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2006-04-08                    The increasing sophistication of software attacks has created the need\rfor increasingly finer-grained intrusion and anomaly detection\rsystems, both at the network and the host level. We believe that the\rnext generation of defense mechanisms will require a much more\rdetailed dynamic analysis of application behavior than is currently\rdone.  We also note that the same type of behavior analysis is needed\rby the current embryonic attempts at self-healing systems. Because\rsuch mechanisms are currently perceived as too expensive in terms of\rtheir performance impact, questions relating to the feasibility and\rvalue of such analysis remain unexplored and unanswered.\r\rWe present a new mechanism for profiling the behavior space of an\rapplication by analyzing all function calls made by the process,\rincluding regular functions and library calls, as well as system\rcalls. We derive behavior from aspects of both control and data flow.\rWe show how to build and check profiles that contain this information\rat the binary level -- that is, without making changes to the\rapplication's source, the operating system, or the compiler. This\rcapability makes our system, Lugrind, applicable to a variety of\rsoftware, including COTS applications. Profiles built for the\rapplications we tested can predict behavior with 97% accuracy given a\rcontext window of 15 functions. Lugrind demonstrates the\rfeasibility of combining binary-level behavior profiling with\rdetection and automated repair.

By using higher- \rorder n-grams, Anagram can detect significant anomalous byte  \rsequences and generate robust signatures of validated malicious  \rpacket content. The Anagram content models are implemented using  \rhighly efficient Bloom filters, reducing space requirements and  \renabling privacy-preserving cross-site correlation. The sensor models  \rthe distinct content flow of a network or host using a semi- \rsupervised training regimen. Previously known exploits, extracted  \rfrom the signatures of an IDS, are likewise modeled in a Bloom filter  \rand are used during training as well as detection time. We demon- \rstrate that Anagram can identify anomalous traffic with high accuracy  \rand low false positive rates. Anagram^Òs high-order n-gram analysis  \rtechnique is also resil-ient against simple mimicry attacks that  \rblend exploits with ^Ónormal^Ô appearing byte padding, such as the  \rblended polymorphic attack recently demonstrated in [1]. We discuss  \rrandomized n-gram models, which further raises the bar and makes it  \rmore difficult for attackers to build precise packet structures to  \revade Anagram even if they know the distribution of the local site  \rcontent flow. Finally, Ana-gram^Òs speed and high detection rate makes  \rit valuable not only as a standalone sensor, but also as a network  \ranomaly flow classifier in an instrumented fault-tolerant host-based  \renvironment; this enables significant cost amortization and the  \rpossibility of a ^Ósymbiotic^Ô feedback loop that can improve accuracy  \rand reduce false positive rates over time.

Keromytis                    2006-04-05                    Many current systems security research efforts focus on mechanisms for\rIntrusion Prevention and Self-Healing Software.  Unfortunately, such\rsystems find it difficult to gain traction in many deployment\rscenarios.  For self-healing techniques to be realistically employed,\rsystem owners and administrators must have enough confidence in the\rquality of a generated fix that they are willing to allow its\rautomatic deployment. \r\rIn order to increase the level of confidence in these systems, the efficacy of a 'fix' must be tested and validated after it\rhas been automatically developed, but before it is actually\rdeployed. Due to the nature of attacks, such verification must proceed\rautomatically.  We call this problem Automatic Repair Validation\r(ARV). As a way to illustrate the difficulties faced by ARV, we\rpropose the design of a system, Bloodhound, that tracks and\rstores malicious network flows for later replay in the validation\rphase for self-healing software.

The approach is based\ron novel and unique custom-designed silicon microtools, which we\rexperimentally verified to produce results similar to the results\rfrom traditionally used boar bristles.  The advantage to using\rsilicon is that it allows the employment of state-of-the-art\rmicro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology to produce\rmicrotools of various shapes and sizes and thatit is rigid and can\rbe easily adopted as an accurately calibrated end-effector on a\rmicrorobotic system.

Keromytis                    2006-03-22                    Collaborative security is a promising solution to many types of security\rproblems. Organizations and individuals often have a limited amount of \rresources to detect and respond to the threat of automated attacks.\rEnabling them to take advantage of the resources of their peers by sharing information related to such threats is a major step towards automating defense systems.\r\rIn particular, comment spam posted on blogs as a way for attackers to\rdo Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a major annoyance. Many measures\rhave been proposed to thwart such spam, but all such measures are currently enacted and operate within one administrative domain. We propose and implement a system for cross-domain information sharing to improve the quality and speed of defense against such spam.

Belhumeur                    2006-03-18                    In this paper, we consider using angle of arrival information\r(bearing) for network localization and control in two different\rfields of multi-agent systems: (i) wireless sensor networks; (ii)\rrobot networks. The essential property we require in this paper is\rthat a node can infer heading information from its neighbors. We\raddress the uniqueness of network localization solutions by the\rtheory of globally rigid graphs. We show that while the parallel\rrigidity problem for formations with bearings is isomorphic to the\rdistance case, the global rigidity of the formation is simpler (in\rfact identical to the simpler rigidity case) for a network with\rbearings, compared to formations with distances. We provide the\rconditions of localization for networks in which the neighbor\rrelationship is not necessarily symmetric.

We derive novel identities, which are the angular frequency domain analogs to common spatial domain invariants such as reflectance ratios. They apply in a number of canonical cases, including single and multiple images of objects under the same and different lighting conditions. One important case we consider is two different glossy objects in two different lighting environments. While this paper is primarily theoretical,\rit has the potential to lay the mathematical foundations for two important practical applications. First, we can develop more general algorithms for inverse rendering problems, which can directly relight and change material properties by transferring the BRDF or lighting from another object or illumination. Second, we can check the consistency of an image, to detect tampering or image splicing.

The main differences between\rDUC 2003 and 2005 datasets pertain to the document length, cluster\rsizes, and model summary length. For five of the DUC 2003 document sets,\rtwo pyramids each were\rconstructed by annotators working independently. Scores of the same\rpeer using different pyramids were highly correlated. Sixteen systems\rwere evaluated on eight document sets.\rAnalysis of variance using Tukey's Honest Significant Difference\rmethod showed significant differences among all eight document sets,\rand more significant differences among the sixteen systems than for DUC 2005.

Belhumeur                    2006-02-25                    This paper is concerned with information structures used in rigid\rformations of autonomous agents that have leader-follower\rarchitecture. The focus of the paper is on sensor/network\rtopologies to secure control of rigidity. This papers extends the\rprevious rigidity based approaches for formations with symmetric\rneighbor relations to include formations with leader-follower\rarchitecture. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for\rrigidity of directed formations, with or without cycles. We\rpresent the directed Henneberg constructions as a sequential\rprocess for all guide rigid digraphs. We refine those results for\racyclic formations, where guide rigid formations had a simple\rconstruction. The analysis in this paper confirms that acyclicity\ris not a necessary condition for stable rigidity. The cycles are\rnot the real problem, but rather the lack of guide freedom is the\rreason behind why cycles have been seen as a problematic topology.\rTopologies that have cycles within a larger architecture can be\rstably rigid, and we conjecture that all guide rigid formations\rare stably rigid for internal control. We analyze how the external\rcontrol of guide agents can be integrated into stable rigidity of\ra larger formation. The analysis in the paper also confirms the\rinconsistencies that result from noisy measurements in redundantly\rrigid formations. An algorithm given in the paper establishes a\rsequential way of determining the directions of links from a given\rundirected rigid formation so that the necessary and sufficient\rconditions are fulfilled.

Carloni, Alberto L. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli                    2006-02-20                    Packet-switched networks-on-chip (NOC) have been advocated as the solution to the challenge of organizing efficient and reliable communication structures among the components of a system-on-chip (SOC). A critical issue in designing a NOC is to determine its topology given the set of point-to-point communication requirements among these\rcomponents. We present a novel approach to on-chip communication synthesis that is based on the iterative combination of two efficient computational steps: (1) an application of the k-Median algorithm to coarsely determine the global communication structure (which may turned out not be a network after all), and a (2) a variation of the shortest-path algorithm in order to finely tune the data flows on the communication channels. The application of our method to case\rstudies taken from the literature shows that we can automatically synthesize optimal NOC topologies for multi-core on-chip processors and it offers new insights on why NOC are not necessarily a value proposition for some classes of applcation-specific SOCs.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Theoretical Bounds on Control-Plane Self-Monitoring in Routing Protocols                                        Raj Kumar Rajendran, Vishal Misra, Dan Rubenstein                    2006-02-15                    Routing protocols rely on the cooperation of nodes in the network to\rboth forward packets and to select the forwarding routes.\rThere have been several instances in which an entire\rnetwork's routing collapsed simply because a seemingly insignificant\rset of nodes reported erroneous routing information to their\rneighbors. It may have been possible for other nodes to trigger an automated response\rand prevent the problem by analyzing received routing information for\rinconsistencies that revealed the errors. Our theoretical study seeks to\runderstand when nodes can detect the existence of errors in the\rimplementation of route\rselection elsewhere in the network through monitoring their own\rrouting states for inconsistencies. We start by constructing a\rmethodology, called Strong-Detection, that helps answer the\rquestion. We then apply Strong-Detection to three classes of routing\rprotocols: distance-vector, path-vector, and link-state.  For each\rclass, we derive low-complexity, self-monitoring algorithms that use\rthe routing state created by these routing protocols to identify any\rdetectable anomalies. These algorithms are then used\rto compare and contrast the self-monitoring power these various\rclasses of protocols possess. We also study the trade-off between\rtheir state-information complexity and ability to identify routing anomalies.

We survey techniques that are used for security and privacy of presence information. In particular, we describe the SIMPLE based presence specific authentication, integrity and confidentiality. We also discuss the IETF’s common policy for geo-privacy, presence authorization for presence information privacy and distribution of different levels of presence information to different watchers. Additionally, we describe an open problem of getting the aggregated presence from the trusted server without the server knowing the presence information, and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss denial of service attacks on the presence system and ways to mitigate them.

Presence-based services depend on accurate and timely delivery of presence information. Hence, presence systems need to be appropriately dimensioned to meet the growing number of users, varying number of devices as presence sources, the rate at which they update presence information to the network and the rate at which network distributes the user’s presence information to the watchers. SIMPLEstone is a set of metrics for benchmarking the performance of presence systems based on SIMPLE. SIMPLEstone benchmarks a presence server by generating requests based on a work load specification. It measures server capacity in terms of request handling capacity as an aggregate of all types of requests as well as individual request types. The benchmark treats different configuration modes in which presence server interoperates with the Session Initiation protocol (SIP) server as one block.

GDQ achieves accurate proportional fairness scheduling with only O(1) scheduling overhead.\r\rGDQ takes a novel approach to distributed queuing: instead of creating per-processor queues that need to be constantly balanced to achieve any measure of proportional sharing fairness, GDQ uses a simple grouping strategy to organize processes into groups based on similar processor time allocation rights, and then assigns processors to groups based on aggregate group shares. Group membership of processes is static, and fairness is achieved by dynamically migrating processors among groups. The set of processors working on a group use simple, low-overhead round-robin queues, while processor reallocation among groups is achieved using a new multiprocessor adaptation of the well-known Weighted Fair Queuing algorithm. By commoditizing processors and decoupling their allocation from process scheduling, GDQ provides, with only constant scheduling cost, fairness within a constant of the ideal generalized processor sharing model for process weights with a fixed upper bound.\r\rWe have implemented GDQ in Linux and measured its performance. Our experimental results show that GDQ has low overhead and scales well with the number of processors.

Keromytis                    2006-02-06                    While web communications are increasingly protected by transport\rlayer cryptographic operations (SSL/TLS), there are many\rsituations where even the communications infrastructure provider\rcannot be trusted. The end-to-end (E2E) encryption of data\rbecomes increasingly important in these trust models to protect\rthe confidentiality and integrity of the data against snooping\rand modification by the communications provider.\r\rWe introduce W3Bcrypt, an extension to the Mozilla Firefox web\rplatform that enables application-level cryptographic protection\rfor web content. In effect, we view cryptographic operations as\ra type of style to be applied to web content along with layout\rand coloring operations. Among the main benefits of using\rencryption as a stylesheet are $(a)$ reduced workload on a web\rserver, $(b)$ targeted content publication, and $(c)$ greatly\rincreased privacy. This paper discusses our implementation for\rFirefox, but the core ideas are applicable to most current\rbrowsers.

The adaptations we are concerned\rwith assist with problem detection, diagnosis and\rremediation. Many existing computing systems do not include\rsuch adaptation mechanisms, as a result these systems\reither need to be re-designed to include them or there\rneeds to be a mechanism for retro-fitting these mechanisms.\rThe purpose of the adaptation mechanisms is to ease the\rjob of the system administrator with respect to managing\rsoftware systems. This paper introduces Kheiron, a framework\rfor facilitating adaptations in running programs in a\rvariety of execution environments without requiring the redesign\rof the application. Kheiron manipulates compiled\rC programs running in an unmanaged execution environment\ras well as programs running in Microsoft’s Common\rLanguage Runtime and SunMicrosystems’ Java VirtualMachine.\rWe present case-studies and experiments that demonstrate\rthe feasibility of using Kheiron to support self-healing\rsystems. We also describe the concepts and techniques used\rto retro-fit adaptations onto existing systems in the various\rexecution environments.

To\rsupport SHS, we propose Smart Error Virtualization (SEV),\rwhich treats functions as transactions but provides a way to\rguide the program state and remediation to be a more correct\rvalue than previous work.\r\rWe perform runtime binary-level profiling on unmodified \rapplications to learn both good return values and error return \rvalues (produced when the program encounters ``bad'' input). \rThe goal is to ``learn from mistakes'' by converting malicious \rinput to the program's notion of ``bad'' input.\r\rWe introduce two implementations of this system that support\rthree major uses: function profiling for regression testing, \rfunction profiling for host-based anomaly detection \r(envinroment-specialized fault detection), and function profiling\rfor automatic attack remediation via SEV. Our systems do not\rrequire access to the source code of the application to enact\ra fix. Finally, this paper is, in part, a critical examination of \rerror virtualization in order to shed light on how to approach\rsemantic correctness.

Bessen                    2005-12-14                    We study the complexity of approximating the smallest eigenvalue of a univariate Sturm-Liouville problem on a quantum computer. This general problem includes the special case of solving a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation with a given potential for the ground state energy. \rThe Sturm-Liouville problem depends on a function q, which, in the case of the Schroedinger equation, can be identified with the potential function V. Recently Papageorgiou and Wozniakowski proved that quantum computers achieve an exponential reduction in the number of queries over the number needed in the classical worst-case and randomized settings for smooth functions q. Their method uses the (discretized) unitary propagator and arbitrary powers of it as a query (\"power queries\"). They showed that the Sturm-Liouville equation can be solved with O(log(1/e)) power queries, while the number of queries in the worst-case and randomized settings on a classical computer is polynomial in 1/e. This proves that a quantum computer with power queries achieves an exponential reduction in the number of queries compared to a classical computer. \rIn this paper we show that the number of queries in Papageorgiou's and Wozniakowski's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In particular we prove a matching lower bound of log(1/e) power queries, therefore showing that log(1/e) power queries are sufficient and necessary. Our proof is based on a frequency analysis technique, which examines the probability distribution of the final state of a quantum algorithm and the dependence of its Fourier transform on the input.

Autonomic controllers often require\rthat events be correlated across multiple components using rule patterns with timer-based transitions, e.g., to detect denial\rof service attacks and to warn of staging problems with business critical applications. This short paper discusses automatic\radjustment of timer values for event correlation rules, in particular compensating for the variability of event propagation\rdelays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. We describe a corresponding Management Station\rarchitecture and present experimental studies on a testbed system that suggest that this approach can produce results at least\ras good as an optimal fixed setting of timer values.

These computers are often far more capable than is needed to accomplish their primary task, whether it be guarding a circuit breaker, displaying a map, or running a word processor.  These devices would be far more useful if they had some awareness of the world around them: a controller that resists tripping a switch, knowing that it would set off a cascade failure, a PDA that warns its owner of imminent danger, a PC that exchanges reports of suspicious network activity to its peers to identify stealthy computer crackers.  \r\rIn order to provide these higher-level services, the devices need a model of their environment.  The controller needs a model of the distribution grid, the PDA needs a model of the battlespace, and the PC needs a model of the network and of normal network and user behavior. Unfortunately, not only might models such as these require substantial computational resources, but generating and updating them is even more demanding. Modelbuilding algorithms tend to be bad in three ways: requiring large amounts of CPU and memory to run, needing large amounts of data from the outside to stay up to date, and running so slowly that can’t keep up with any fast changes in the environment that might occur.  \r\rWe can solve these problems by reducing the scope of the model to the immediate locale of the device, since reducing the size of the model makes the problem of model generation much more tractable. But such models are also much less useful, having no knowledge of the wider system.  \r\rThis thesis proposes a better solution to this problem called Level of Detail, after the computer graphics technique of the same name. Instead of simplifying the representation of distant objects, however, we simplify less-important data. Compute devices in the system receive streams of data that is a mixture of detailed data from devices that directly affect them and data summaries (aggregated data) from less directly influential devices. The degree to which the data is aggregated (i.e., how much it is reduced) is determined by calculating an influence metric between the target device and the remote device. The smart controller thus receives a continuous stream of raw data from the adjacent transformer, but only an occasional small status report summarizing all the equipment in a neighborhood in another part of the city.  \r\rThis thesis describes the data distribution system, the aggregation functions, and the influence metrics that can be used to implement such a system. I also describe my current towards establishing a test environment and validating the concepts, and describe the next steps in the research plan.

Long                    2005-12-06                    We view a dataset of points or samples as having an underlying, yet\runspecified, tree structure and exploit this assumption in learning\rproblems. Such a tree structure assumption is equivalent to treating a\rdataset as being tree dependent identically distributed or tdid and\rpreserves exchange-ability. This extends traditional iid assumptions\ron data since each datum can be sampled sequentially after being\rconditioned on a parent. Instead of hypothesizing a single best tree\rstructure, we infer a richer Bayesian posterior distribution over tree\rstructures from a given dataset. We compute this posterior over\r(directed or undirected) trees via the Laplacian of conditional\rdistributions between pairs of input data points. This posterior\rdistribution is efficiently normalized by the Laplacian's\rdeterminant and also facilitates novel maximum likelihood estimators,\refficient expectations and other useful inference computations. In a\rclassification setting, tdid assumptions yield a criterion that\rmaximizes the determinant of a matrix of conditional distributions\rbetween pairs of input and output points. This leads to a novel\rclassification algorithm we call the Maximum Determinant\rMachine. Unsupervised and supervised experiments are shown.

The critical\rproblem is that systems currently lack the capability to respond \rintelligently and automatically to attacks -- especially attacks \rthat exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities or are delivered by\rpreviously unseen inputs. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to \rprovide an environment where both supervision and automatic \rremediation can take place. Also provided is a mechanism to guide \rthe supervision environment in detection and repair activities.\r\rThis thesis supports the notion of Self-Healing Software by\rintroducing three novel techniques: \\emph{micro-sandboxing}, \r\\emph{micro-speculation}, and \\emph{self-correcting assertions}. These\rtechniques are combined in a kernel-level emulation framework to \rspeculatively execute code that may contain faults or \rvulnerabilities and automatically repair such faults or exploited \rvulnerabilities. The framework, VPUF, introduces the concept of\rcomputation as an operating system service by providing control\rfor an array of virtual processors in the Linux kernel (creating\rthe concept of an \\emph{endolithic} kernel). This thesis introduces\rROAR (Recognize, Orient, Adapt, Respond) as a conceptual\rworkflow for Self-healing Software systems.\r\rThis thesis proposal outlines a 17 month program for developing the \rmajor components of the proposed system, implementing them on a \rCOTS operating system and programming language, subjecting them to \ra battery of evaluations for performance and efficacy, and publishing \rthe results. In addition, this proposal looks forward to several \rareas of follow-on work, including implementing some of the proposed \rtechniques in hardware and leveraging the general kernel-level \rframework to support Application Communities.

This paper explores the extent to which control\rtheory can provide an architectural and analytic foundation for\rbuilding self-managing systems. Control theory provides a rich set of\rmethodologies for building automated self-diagnosis and self-repairing\rsystems with properties such as stability, short settling times, and\raccurate regulation. However, there are challenges in applying control\rtheory to computing systems, such as developing effective resource\rmodels, handling sensor delays, and addressing lead times in effector\ractions. We propose a deployable testbed for autonomic computing\r(DTAC) that we believe will reduce the barriers to addressing research\rproblems in applying control theory to computing systems. The initial\rDTAC architecture is described along with several problems that it can\rbe used to investigate.

Recent findings have revealed that the minimum-hop metric can not achieve the maximum throughput because it tries to reduce the number of hops by containing long range links, where packets need to be transmitted at the lowest transmission rate. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between transmission rates and throughputs and show that in dense networks with uniform-distributed traffic, there exists the optimal rate that may not be the lowest rate. Based on our observation, we propose a new routing metric, which measures the expected capability of a path assuming the per-node fairness. We develop a routing protocol based on DSDV and demonstrate that the routing metric enhances the system throughput by 20% compared to the original DSDV.

However, none of these services directly enables performing reconfigurations, repairs or diagnostics on the managed\rapplications and/or its constituent subsystems and components.\rIn this paper we examine how the facilities of a managed execution environment can be leveraged to support runtime system adaptations, such as reconfigurations and repairs. We describe an adaptation framework we have developed, which uses these facilities to dynamically attach/detach an engine capable of performing reconfigurations and repairs on a target system while it executes. Our adaptation framework is lightweight, and transparent to the application and the managed execution environment: it does not require recompilation of the application nor specially compiled\rversions of the managed execution runtime. Our prototype was implemented for the CLR. To evaluate our framework beyond toy examples, we searched on SourceForge for potential target systems already implemented on the CLR that might benefit from runtime adaptation. We report on our experience using our prototype to effect runtime reconfigurations in a system that was developed and is in use by others: the Alchemi enterprise Grid Computing System developed at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

In addition, the introduction of lecture videos into the online curriculum has drawn attention to the disparity in the network resources available to students. We present an e-Learning architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Interactive Internet Team Video), which allows groups of students to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each student will view semantically equivalent content at all times.  A semantic compression model is developed to provide instructional videos at different level-of-details to accommodate dynamic network conditions and users’ system requirements.  We take advantage of the semantic compression algorithm’s ability to provide different layers of semantically equivalent video by adapting the client to play at the appropriate layer that provides the client with the richest possible viewing experience.  Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any group member and and the results of those actions are synchronized with all the other students.  These features allow students to review a lecture video in tandem, facilitating the learning process. Experimental trials show that AI2TV successfully synchronizes instructional videos for distributed students while concurrently optimizing the video quality, even under conditions of fluctuating bandwidth, by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each student while still maintaining the invariant.

We have\rdeveloped a framework, Crunch, which employs various heuristics for\rcontent extraction in the form of filters applied to the webpage's DOM\rtree; the filters aim to prune or transform the clutter, leaving only the content. Crunch allows users to tune what we call \"settings\", consisting of thresholds for applying a particular filter and/or for toggling a filter on/off, because the HTML components that characterize clutter can vary significantly from website to website. However, we have found that the same settings tend to work well across different websites of the same genre, e.g., news or shopping, since the designers often employ similar page layouts. In particular, Crunch could obtain the settings for a previously unknown website by automatically classifying it as sufficiently similar to a cluster of known websites with previously adjusted settings. We present our approach to clustering a large corpus of websites into genres, using their pre-extraction textual material augmented by the snippets generated by searching for the website's domain name in web search engines. Including these snippets increases the frequency of function words needed for clustering. We use existing Manhattan distance measure and hierarchical clustering techniques, with some modifications, to pre-classify the corpus into genres offline. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the set of genres that websites fit into, but to be useful a priori settings must be available for some member of each cluster or a nearby cluster (otherwise defaults are used). Crunch classifies newly encountered websites online in linear-time, and then applies the corresponding filter settings, with no noticeable delay added by our content-extracting web proxy.

However, most existing solutions have typically been focused on \"intra-organizational\" correlation; organizations typically employ privacy policies that prohibit the exchange of information outside of the organization. At the same time, the promise of \"inter-organizational\" correlation is significant given the broad availability of Internet-scale communications, and its potential role in both software maintenance and software vulnerability exploits.\r\rIn this proposal, I present a framework for reconciling these opposing forces in event correlation via the use of privacy preservation integrated into the event processing framework. By integrating flexible privacy policies, we enable the correlation of organizations' data without actually releasing sensitive information. The framework supports both source anonymity and data privacy, yet allows for the time-based correlation of a broad variety of data. The framework is designed as a lightweight collection of components to enable integration with existing COTS platforms and distributed systems. I also present two different implementations of this framework: XUES (XML Universal Event Service), an event processor used as part of a software monitoring platform called KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme), and Worminator, a collaborative Intrusion Detection System.\r\rKX comprised a series of components, connected together with a publish-subscribe content-based routing event subsystem, for the autonomic software monitoring of complex distributed systems. Sensors were installed in legacy systems. XUES' two modules then performed event processing on sensor data: information was collected and processed by the Event Packager, and correlated using the Event Distiller. While XUES itself was not privacy-preserving, it laid the groundwork for this thesis by supporting event typing, the use of publish-subscribe and extensibility support via pluggable event transformation modules.\r\rWorminator, the second implementation, extends the XUES platform to fully support privacy-preserving event types and algorithms in the context of a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), whereby sensor alerts can be exchanged and corroborated--a reduced form of correlation that enables collaborative verification--without revealing sensitive information about a contributor's network, services, or even external sources as required. Worminator also fully anonymizes source information, allowing contributors to decide their preferred level of information disclosure. Worminator is implemented as a monitoring framework on top of a COTS IDS sensor, and demonstrably enables the detection of not only worms but also \"broad and stealthy\" scans; traditional single-network sensors either bury such scans in large volumes or miss them entirely. Worminator has been successfully deployed at 5 collaborating sites and work is under way to scale it up further.\r\rThe contributions of this thesis include the development of a cross-application-domain event correlation framework with native privacy-preserving types, the use and validation of privacy-preserving corroboration, and the establishment of a practical deployed collaborative security system. I also outline the next steps in the thesis research plan, including the development of evaluation metrics to quantify Worminator's effectiveness at long-term scan detection, the overhead of privacy preservation and the effectiveness of our approach against adversaries, be they \"honest-but-curious\" or actively malicious. This thesis has broad future work implications, including privacy-preserving signature detection and distribution, distributed stealthy attacker profiling, and \"application community\"-based software vulnerability detection.

II: Second-order elliptic problems                                        A. G. Werschulz, H. Wozniakowski                    2005-11-01                    In a previous paper, we developed a general framework for establishing\rtractability and strong tractability for quasilinear multivariate\rproblems in the worst case setting.  One important example of such a\rproblem is the solution of the Poisson equation $-\\Delta u + qu = f$\rin the $d$-dimensional unit cube, in which $u$ depends linearly\ron~$f$, but nonlinearly on~$q$.  Here, both $f$ and~$q$ are\r$d$-variate functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with\rfinite-order weights of order~$\\omega$.  This means that, although~$d$\rcan be arbitrary large, $f$ and~$q$ can be decomposed as sums of\rfunctions of at most $\\omega$~variables, with $\\omega$ independent\rof~$d$.\r\rIn this paper, we apply our previous general results to the Poisson\requation, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann homogeneous boundary\rconditions.  We study both the absolute and normalized error criteria.\rFor all four possible combinations of boundary conditions and error\rcriteria, we show that the problem is \\emph{tractable}.  That is, the\rnumber of evaluations of $f$ and~$q$ needed to obtain an\r$\\e$-approximation is polynomial in~$\\e^{-1}$ and~$d$, with the degree\rof the polynomial depending linearly on~$\\omega$.  In addition, we\rwant to know when the problem is \\emph{strongly tractable}, meaning\rthat the dependence is polynomial only in~$\\e^{-1}$, independently\rof~$d$.  We show that if the sum of the weights defining the weighted\rreproducing kernel Hilbert space is uniformly bounded in~$d$ and the\rintegral of the univariate kernel is positive, then the Poisson\requation is strongly tractable for three of the four possible\rcombinations of boundary conditions and error criterion, the only\rexception being the Dirichlet boundary condition under the normalized\rerror criterion.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           TCP-Friendly Rate Control with Token Bucket for VoIP Congestion Control                                        Miguel Maldonado, Salman Abdul Baset, Henning Schulzrinne                    2005-10-17                    TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control algorithm that provides a smooth transmission rate for real-time\rnetwork applications. TFRC refrains from halving the sending rate on every packet drop, instead it is adjusted as a function of\rthe loss rate during a single round trip time. TFRC has been proven to be fair when competing with TCP flows over congested\rlinks, but it lacks quality-of-service parameters to improve the performance of real-time traffic. A problem with TFRC is that it\ruses additive increase to adjust the sending rate during periods with no congestion. This leads to short term congestion that can\rdegrade the quality of voice applications.\r\rWe propose two changes to TFRC that improve the performance of VoIP applications. Our implementation, TFRC with Token\rBucket (TFRC-TB), uses discrete calculated bit rates based on audio codec bandwidth usage to increase the sending rate. Also, it\ruses a token bucket to control the sending rate during congestion periods. We have used ns2, the network simulator, to compare\rour implementation to TFRC in a wide range of network conditions. Our results suggest that TFRC-TB can provide a quality of\rservice (QoS) mechanism to voice applications while competing fairly with other traffic over congested links.

All four\rarchitectures implemented a series of typical web\rapplication tasks. Our findings indicated that PHP\rproduced the smallest delay, while the SOAP\rimplementation produces the largest.

We adapt square root algo­rithms, popular in Kalman filtering, to graphs with arbitrary topologies. The method consists of maintaining potentials and generating messages that involve the square root of precision matrices. Combining this with the machinery of the junction tree algorithm leads to an efficient and nu­merically stable algorithm. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the method to numerical errors that can arise in com­plex learning and inference problems.

Aner Ben-Artzi                    2005-10-07                    In this note, I explore why the the common approximation of the reflection integral is not written with a delta omega-in ( ) to replace the differential omega-in ( ).  After that, I go on to discover what really happens when the sum over all directions is reduced to a sum over a small number of directions.  In the final section, I make recommendations for correctly approximating the reflection sum, and briefly suggest a possible framework for multiple importance sampling on both lighting and brdf.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           DotSlash: Providing Dynamic Scalability to Web Applications with On-demand Distributed Query Result Caching                                        Weibin Zhao, Henning Schulzrinne                    2005-09-29                    Scalability poses a significant challenge for today's web applications,\rmainly due to the large population of potential users. To effectively\raddress the problem of short-term dramatic load spikes caused by web\rhotspots, we developed a self-configuring and scalable rescue system\rcalled DotSlash. The primary goal of our system is to provide dynamic\rscalability to web applications by enabling a web site to obtain\rresources dynamically, and use them autonomically without any\radministrative intervention. To address the database server bottleneck,\rDotSlash allows a web site to set up on-demand distributed query result\rcaching, which greatly reduces the database workload for read mostly\rdatabases, and thus increases the request rate supported at a\rDotSlash-enabled web site. The novelty of our work is that our query\rresult caching is on demand, and operated based on load conditions.\rThe caching remains inactive as long as the load is normal, but is\ractivated once the load is heavy. This approach offers good data\rconsistency during normal load situations, and good scalability with\rrelaxed data consistency for heavy load periods. We have built a\rprototype system for the widely used LAMP configuration, and evaluated\rour system using the RUBBoS bulletin board benchmark. Experiments show\rthat a DotSlash-enhanced web site can improve the maximum request rate\rsupported by a factor of 5 using 8 rescue servers for the RUBBoS\rsubmission mix, and by a factor of 10 using 15 rescue servers for\rthe RUBBoS read-only mix.

We\rview the underlying structure of an elastic block cipher as a network,\rwhich we refer to as an elastic network, and analyze the network in a manner similar to the analysis performed by Luby and Rackoff on Fesitel networks. We prove that a three round elastic network is a pseudorandom permutation and a four round network is a strong pseudorandom permutation when the round functions are pseudorandom permutations.

We relate the security of the elastic version\rof a block cipher to the fixed-length version by forming a reduction\rbetween the versions. Our method is independent of the specific\rblock cipher used. The results imply that if the fixed-length version\rof a block cipher is secure against attacks which attempt key recovery then the elastic version is also secure against such attacks.

Our scheme\rallows us to dynamically \"stretch\" the supported block size of\ra block cipher up to a length double the original block size, while\rincreasing the computational workload proportionally to the\rblock size. We show that traditional attacks against an elastic block\rcipher are impractical if the original cipher is secure. In this paper\rwe focus on differential and linear attacks. Specifically, we employ\ran elastic version of Rijndael supporting block sizes of 128 to 256\rbits as an example, and show it is resistant to both differential and\rlinear attacks. In particular, employing a different method than what\ris employed in Rijndael design, we show that the probability of any\rdifferential characteristic for the elastic version of Rijndael is\r<= 2^-(block size). We further prove that both linear and\rnonlinear attacks are computationally infeasible for any elastic block\rcipher if the original cipher is not subject to such an attack and\rinvolves a block size for which an exhaustive plaintext search is\rcomputationally infeasible (as is the case for Rijndael).

Keromytis                    2005-08-26                    Many websites are driven by web applications that deliver dynamic content stored in SQL databases. Such systems take input directly from the client via HTML forms. Without proper input validation, these systems are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\r\rThe predominant defense against such attacks is to implement better input validation. This strategy is unlikely to succeed on its own. A better approach is to protect systems against SQL injection automatically and not rely on manual supervision or testing strategies (which are incomplete by nature). SQL randomization is a technique that defeats SQL injection attacks by transforming the language of SQL statements in a web application such that an attacker needs to guess the transformation in order to successfully inject his code.\r\rWe present PachyRand, an extension to the PostgreSQL JDBC driver that performs SQL randomization. Our system is easily portable to most other JDBC drivers, has a small performance impact, and makes SQL injection attacks infeasible.

We prove that under\rseveral assumptions the search space is a complete grammar lattice,\rand the lattice top element is a grammar that can always be learned\rfrom a set of representative examples and a sublanguage used to\rreduce the grammar semantics.

However, many of these techniques share a\rsurprisingly high number of similarities. In this technical report we analyze and\revaluate the most relevant mobility management techniques, pointing out\rdifferences and similarities. For macro-mobility we consider Mobile IP (MIP),\rthe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and mobility management techniques\rtypical of a GSM network; for micro-mobility we describe and analyze several\rprotocols such as: Hierarchical MIP, TeleMIP, IDMP, Cellular IP and HAWAII.

Existing techniques for pointer analysis apply a collection of inference rules to a dismantled intermediate form of the source program, making them difficult to apply to source-to-source tools that generally work on abstract syntax trees to preserve details of the source program. Our pointer analysis algorithm operates directly on the abstract syntax tree of a C program and uses a form of standard dataflow analysis to compute the desired points-to information. We have implemented our algorithm in a source-to-source translation framework and experimental results show that it is practical on real-world examples.

In addition, the introduction of lecture videos into the online curriculum has drawn attention to the disparity in the network resources used by students. We present an e-Learning architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Internet Interactive Team Video), a system that allows borderless, virtual students, possibly some or all disadvantaged in network resources, to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each student will view semantically equivalent content at all times. Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any of the students and the results of those actions are seen by all the other students. These features allow group members to review a lecture video in tandem to facilitate the learning process. We show in experimental trials that our system can successfully synchronize video for distributed students while, at the same time, optimizing the video quality given actual (fluctuating) bandwidth by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each student.

In this paper we study the tractability of quasilinear multivariate problems.  That is, we wish to approximate nonlinear operators~$S_d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ that depend linearly on the first argument and satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to both arguments.  Here, both arguments are functions of $d$~variables.  Many computational problems of practical importance have this form.  Examples inlude the solution of specific Dirichlet, Neumann, and Schr\\\"odinger problems.  We show, under appropriate assumptions, that quasilinear problems, whose domain spaces are equipped with product or finite-order weights, are tractable or strongly tractable in the worst case setting.\r\rThis paper is the first part in a series of papers.  Here, we present tractability results for quasilinear problems under general assumptions on quasilinear operators and weights.  In future papers, we shall verify these assumptions for quasilinear problems such as the solution of specific Dirichlet, Neumann, and Schr\\\"odinger problems.

Servedio                    2005-08-02                    We consider the problem of learning a halfspace in the agnostic framework \rof Kearns et al., where a learner is given access to a distribution on labelled examples but the labelling may be arbitrary. The learner's goal is to output a hypothesis which performs almost as well as the optimal halfspace with respect to future draws from this distribution. Although the agnostic learning framework does not explicitly deal with noise, it is closely related to learning in worst-case noise models such as malicious noise.\r\rWe give the first polynomial-time algorithm for agnostically learning halfspaces with respect to several distributions, such as the uniform distribution over the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube {0,1}^n or unit sphere in n-dimensional Euclidean space, as well as any log-concave distribution in n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Given any constant additive factor eps>0, our algorithm runs in poly(n) time and constructs a hypothesis whose error rate is within an additive eps of the optimal halfspace. We also show this algorithm agnostically learns Boolean disjunctions in time roughly 2^{\\sqrt{n}} with respect to any distribution; this is the first subexponential-time algorithm for this problem. Finally, we obtain a new algorithm for PAC learning halfspaces under the uniform distribution on the unit sphere which can tolerate the highest level of malicious noise of any algorithm to date.\r\rOur main tool is a polynomial regression algorithm which finds a polynomial that best fits a set of points with respect to a particular metric.  We show that, in fact, this algorithm is an arbitrary-distribution generalization of the well known ``low-degree'' Fourier algorithm of Linial, Mansour, & Nisan and has excellent noise tolerance properties when minimizing with respect to the L_1 norm. We apply this algorithm in conjunction with a non-standard Fourier transform (which does not use the traditional parity basis) for learning halfspaces over the uniform distribution on the unit sphere; we believe this technique is of independent interest.

Servedio                    2005-07-28                    We consider the problem of learning mixtures of product distributions\rover discrete domains in the distribution learning framework\rintroduced by Kearns et al.  We give a $\\poly(n/\\eps)$ time algorithm\rfor learning a mixture of $k$ arbitrary product distributions over the\r$n$-dimensional Boolean cube $\\{0,1\\}^n$ to accuracy $\\eps$, for any\rconstant $k$. Previous polynomial time algorithms could only achieve\rthis for $k = 2$ product distributions; our result answers an open\rquestion stated independently by Cryan and by Freund and Mansour.  We\rfurther give evidence that no polynomial time algorithm can succeed\rwhen $k$ is superconstant, by reduction from a notorious open problem\rin PAC learning.  Finally, we generalize our $\\poly(n/\\eps)$ time\ralgorithm to learn any mixture of $k = O(1)$ product distributions\rover $\\{0,1, \\dots, b\\}^n$, for any $b = O(1)$.

Conway, Kedar Namjoshi, Dennis Dams, Stephen A. Edwards                    2005-07-10                    Automaton-based static program analysis has proved to be an effective tool for bug finding. Current tools generally\rre-analyze a program from scratch in response to a change in the code, which can result in much duplicated\reffort. We present an inter-procedural algorithm that analyzes incrementally in response to program changes and\rpresent experiments for a null-pointer dereference analysis. It shows a substantial speed-up over re-analysis from\rscratch, with a manageable amount of disk space used to store information between analysis runs.

These features\rmake the grammars suitable for developing robust and scalable natural language understanding systems. Our grammars capture both syntax and semantics and have two types of constraints at the rule level: one for semantic composition and one for ontology-based semantic interpretation. We prove that these grammars can always be learned from a small set of\rsemantically annotated, ordered representative examples, using a\rrelational learning algorithm. We introduce a new semantic\rrepresentation for natural language, which is suitable for an\rontology-based interpretation and allows us to learn the compositional\rconstraints together with the grammar rules. Besides the learnability\rresults, we give a principle for grammar merging. The experiments\rpresented in this paper show promising results for the adequacy of\rthese grammars in learning natural language. Relatively simple\rlinguistic knowledge is needed to build the small set of semantically\rannotated examples required for the grammar induction.

Nayar                    2005-05-31                    Skin is the outer most tissue of the human body. As a result, people\rare very aware of, and very sensitive to, the appearance of their\rskin. Consequently, skin appearance has been a subject of great\rinterest in various fields of science and technology. \rResearch on skin appearance has been\rintensely pursued in the fields of medicine, cosmetology, computer\rgraphics and computer vision.  Since the goals of these fields are\rvery different, each field has tended to focus on specific aspects of\rthe appearance of skin. The goal of this work is to present a\rcomprehensive survey that includes the most prominent results related\rto skin in these different fields and show how these seemingly\rdisconnected studies are related to one another.

Yet,\rthere is an abundance of materials in nature whose appearance varies\rdramatically with time, such as cracking paint, growing grass, or\rripening banana skins.  In this paper, we take a significant step\rtowards addressing this problem, investigating a new class of\rtime-varying textures.  We make three contributions.  First, we\rdescribe the carefully controlled acquisition of datasets of a variety\rof natural processes including the growth of grass, the accumulation\rof snow, and the oxidation of copper.  Second, we show how to adapt\rquilting-based methods to time-varying texture synthesis, addressing\rthe important challenges of maintaining temporal coherence, efficient\rsynthesis on large time-varying datasets, and reducing visual\rartifacts specific to time-varying textures.  Finally, we show how\rsimple procedural techniques can be used to control the evolution of\rthe results, such as allowing for a faster growth of grass in well lit\r(as opposed to shadowed) areas.

A key element in all\rfuture multi-agent systems will be the role of sensor and\rcommunication networks as an integral part of coordination.\rNetwork topologies are critically important for autonomous\rsystems involving mobile underwater, ground and\rair vehicles and for sensor networks. This paper focuses on\rdeveloping techniques and strategies for the analysis and\rdesign of sensor and network topologies required to merge\rglobally rigid formations for cooperative tasks. Central to\rthe development of these techniques and strategies will be\rthe use of tools from rigidity theory, and graph theory.

The scheduling policies for these servers can be either processor-sharing or first-come first-serve. Furthermore, a dispatcher that assigns jobs to the servers takes as input only the size of the arriving job and the overall job-size distribution.This general model captures the behavior of a variety of real systems, such as web server clusters. Our goal is to identify assignment strategies that the dispatcher can perform to minimize expected completion time and waiting time. We show that there exist optimal strategies that are deterministic, fixing the server to which jobs of particular sizes are always sent. We prove that the optimal strategy for systems with identical servers assigns a non-overlapping interval range of job sizes to each server. We then prove that when server processing speeds differ, it is necessary to assign each server a distinct set of intervals of job sizes in order to minimize expected waiting or response times. We explore some of the practical challenges of identifying the optimal strategy, and also study a related problem that uses our model of how to provision server processing speeds to minimize waiting and completion time given a job size distribution and fixed aggregate processing power.

Allen                    2005-04-27                    We present a hybrid method for localizing a mobile robot in a complex environment. The method combines the use of multiresolution histograms with a signal strength analysis of existing wireless networks. We tested this localization procedure on the campus of Columbia University with our mobile robot, the Autonomous Vehicle for Exploration and Navigation of Urban Environments. Our results indicate that localization accuracy is significantly improved when five levels of resolution are used instead of one in color histogramming. We also find that incorporating wireless signal strengths into the method further improves reliability and helps to resolve ambiguities which arise when different regions have similar visual appearances.

We consider a univariate Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with a nonnegative function $q$ from the class $C^2([0,1])$ and study the minimal number $n(\\e)$ of function evaluations or queries that are necessary to compute an $\\e$-approximation of the smallest eigenvalue.

Ross, Mihir Shah                    2005-04-18                    Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allows multiple threads to supply instructions to the instruction pipeline of a superscalar processor. Because threads share processor resources, an SMT system is inherently different from a multiprocessor system and, therefore, utilizing multiple threads on an SMT processor creates new challenges for database implementers.We investigate three thread-based techniques to exploit SMT architectures on memory-resident data. First, we consider running independent operations in separate threads, a technique applied to conventional multiprocessor systems. Second, we describe a novel implementation strategy in which individual operators are implemented in a multi-threaded fashion. Finally, we introduce a new data-structure called a work-ahead set that allows us to use one of the threads to aggressively preload data into the cache for use by the other thread.We evaluate each method with respect to its performance, implementation complexity, and other measures. We also provide guidance regarding when and how to best utilize the various threading techniques. Our experimental results show that by taking advantage of SMT technology we achieve a 30\\% to 70\\% improvement in throughput over single threaded implementations on in-memory database operations.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Quantum algorithms and complexity for certain continuous and related discrete problems                                        Marek Kwas                    2005-04-14                    The thesis contains an analysis of two computational problems. The first problem is discrete quantum Boolean summation. This problem is a building block of quantum algorithms for many continuous problems, such as integration, approximation, di®erential equations and path integration. The second problem is continuous multivariate\rFeynman-Kac path integration, which is a special case of path integration. \r\rThe quantum Boolean summation problem can be solved by the quantum summation (QS) algorithm of Brassard, Høyer, Mosca and Tapp, which approximates the arithmetic mean of a Boolean function. We improve the error bound of Brassard et al. for the worst-probabilistic setting. Our error bound is sharp. We also present new sharp error bounds in the average-probabilistic and worst-average settings. Our average-probabilistic error bounds prove the optimality of the QS algorithm for a certain choice of its parameters. The study of the worst-average error shows that the QS algorithm is not optimal in this setting; we need to use a certain number of repetitions to regain its optimality.\r\rThe multivariate Feynman-Kac path integration problem for smooth multivariate functions su®ers from the provable curse of dimensionality in the worst-case deterministic setting, i.e., the minimal number of function evaluations needed to compute an approximation depends exponentially on the number of variables. We show that in\rboth the randomized and quantum settings the curse of dimensionality is vanquished, i.e., the minimal number of function evaluations and/or quantum queries required to compute an approximation depends only polynomially on the reciprocal of the desired accuracy and has a bound independent of the number of variables. The exponents\rof these polynomials are 2 in the randomized setting and 1 in the quantum setting. These exponents can be lowered at the expense of the dependence on the number of variables. Hence, the quantum setting yields exponential speedup over the worst-case\rdeterministic setting, and quadratic speedup over the randomized setting.

We propose a global service discovery system, GloServ, that uses the description logic Web Ontology Language (OWL DL). The GloServ architecture spans both local and wide area networks. It maps knowledge obtained by the service classification ontology to a structured peer-to-peer network such as a Content Addressable Network (CAN). GloServ also performs automated and intelligent registration and querying by exploiting the logical relationships within the service ontologies.

Our implementa-tion is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and allows applications written in any .NET language to be dynamically updatable. Our solution works with the standard ver-sion of the Microsoft Common Language Runtime, and does not require a custom com-piler or runtime. Because no application changes are needed, it is transparent to the appli-cation developer. The runtime overhead of our implementation is low enough to support updating real-time applications (e.g., interactive 3D graphics applications).

Klavans                    2005-03-31                    We present a new approach for summarizing clusters of documents on the same event, some of which are machine translations of foreign-language documents and some of which are English. Our approach to multilingual multi-document summarization uses text similarity to choose sentences from English documents based on the content of the machine translated documents. A manual evaluation shows that 68\\% of the sentence replacements improve the summary, and the overall summarization approach outperforms first-sentence extraction baselines in automatic ROUGE-based evaluations.

Recent findings have revealed that the carriersensing range set in current major implementations does not detect and prevent all interference signals even using RTS/CTS access method together. In this paper, we investigate the effect of interference and develop a mathematical model for it. We demonstrate that the 802.11 DCF does not properly act on the interference channel due to the small size and the exponential increment of backoff windows. The accuracy of our model is verified via simulations. Based on an insight from our model, we present a simple protocol that operates on the top of 802.11 MAC layer and achieves more throughput than rate-adjustment schemes.

Our analysis generalizes existing lower bound approaches to the case where the oracle Q is given by controlled powers Q^p of Q, as it is for example in Shor's order finding algorithm. In this setting we will prove a log (1/epsilon) lower bound for the number of applications of Q^p1, Q^p2, ... This bound is tight due to a matching upper bound. We obtain the lower bound using a new technique based on frequency analysis.

Bessen                    2005-03-22                    The computation of combinatorial and numerical problems on quantum computers is often much faster than on a classical computer in numbers of queries. A query is a procedure by which the quantum computer gains information about the specific problem. Different query definitions were given and our aim is to review them and to show that these definitions are not equivalent. To achieve this result we will study the simulation and approximation of one query type by another. While approximation is easy in one direction, we will show that it is hard in the other direction by a lower bound for the numbers of queries needed in the simulation. The main tool in this lower bound proof is a relationship between quantum algorithms and trigonometric polynomials that we will establish.

Belhumeur                    2005-03-14                    This paper is concerned with information\rstructures used in rigid formations of autonomous agents that\rhave leader-follower architecture. The focus of this paper is\ron sensor/network topologies to secure control of rigidity. We\rextend our previous approach for formations with symmetric\rneighbor relations to include formations with leader-follower\rarchitecture. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stably\rrigid directed formations are given including both cyclic and\racyclic directed formations. Some useful steps for creating\rtopologies of directed rigid formations are developed. An\ralgorithm to determine the directions of links to create\rstably rigid directed formations from rigid undirected\rformations is presented.

The CVE employs a peer-to-peer approach to the frequent real-time updates to the 3D virtual worlds required by avatar movements (fellow students in the same room are depicted by avatars). This paper focuses on our extension to the P2P model to support group viewing of lecture videos, called VECTORS, for Video Enhanced Collaboration for Team Oriented Remote Synchronization. VECTORS supports synchronized viewing of lecture videos, so the students all see \"the same thing at the same time\", and can pause, rewind, etc. in synchrony while discussing the lecture material via \"chat\". We are particularly concerned with the needs of the technologically disenfranchised, e.g., whose only Web/Internet access if via dialup or other relatively low-bandwidth networking. Thus VECTORS employs semantically compressed videos with meager bandwidth requirements. Further, the videos are displayed as a sequence of JPEGs on the walls of a 3D virtual room, requiring fewer local multimedia resources than full motion MPEGs.

In this report we present a routing measurement experiment to characterize current Internet dynamics, including routing pathology, routing prevalence and routing persistence. The focus of our study is route change. We look at the types, duration and likely causes of different route changes and discuss their impact to the design of NSIS. We also review common route change detection methods and investigate rules to determine whether a route change happened in a node's forward-looking or backward-looking direction is detectable. We introduce typical NSIS deployment models and discuss specific categories of route changes that should be considered in each of these models. With the NSIS deployment models in mind, we further give experimental evaluation of two route change detection methods - the packet TTL monitoring method and a new delay variation monitoring method.

Automatic extraction of \"useful and relevant\" content from web pages has many applications, including browsing on small cell phone and PDA screens, speech rendering for the visually impaired, and reducing noise for information retrieval systems. Prior work has led to the development of Crunch, a framework which employs various heuristics in the form of filters and filter settings for content extraction. Crunch allows users to tune these settings, essentially the thresholds for applying each filter. However, in order to reduce human involvement in selecting these heuristic settings, we have extended this work to utilize a website's classification, defined by its genre and physical layout. In particular, Crunch would then obtain the settings for a previously unknown website by automatically classifying it as sufficiently similar to a cluster of known websites with previously adjusted settings - which in practice produces better content extraction results than a single one-size-fits-all set of setting defaults. In this paper, we present our approach to clustering a large corpus of websites by their genre, utilizing the snippets generated by sending the website's domain name to search engines as well as the website's own text. We find that exploiting these snippets not only increased the frequency of function words that directly assist in detecting the genre of a website, but also allow for easier clustering of websites. We use existing techniques like Manhattan distance measure and Hierarchical clustering, with some modifications, to pre-classify websites into genres. Our clustering method does not require prior knowledge of the set of genres that websites fit into, but instead discovers these relationships among websites. Subsequently, we are able to classify newly encountered websites in linear-time, and then apply the corresponding filter settings, with no noticeable delay introduced for the content-extracting web proxy.

While completely generic ^Sone size fits all^T effector technologies seem implausible, we propose a general-purpose programming model and interaction layer that abstracts away from the peculiarities of target-specific effectors, enabling a uniform approach to controlling and coordinating the low-level execution of reconfigurations, repairs, micro-reboots, etc.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Dynamic Adaptation of Rules for Temporal Event Correlation in Distributed Systems                                        Rean Griffith, Joseph L. Hellerstein, Yixin Diao, Gail Kaiser                    2005-01-30                    Event correlation is essential to realizing self-managing distributed systems. For example, distributed systems often require that events be correlated from multiple systems using temporal patterns to detect denial of service attacks and to warn of problems with business critical applications that run on multiple servers. This paper addresses how to specify timer values for temporal patterns so as to manage the trade-off between false alarms and undetected alarms. A central concern is addressing the variability of event propagation delays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. To this end, we develop an architecture and an adaptive control algorithm that dynamically compensate for variations in propagation delays. Our approach makes Management Stations more autonomic by avoiding the need for manual adjustments of timer values in temporal rules. Further, studies we conducted of a testbed system suggest that our approach produces results that are at least as good as an optimal fixed setting of timer values.

The autonomic controller is used within a tool for enhancing distance learning with synchronous group review of online multimedia material. The autonomic controller monitors video state at the clients' end, and adapts the quality of the video according to the resources of each client in (soft) real time. Experimental results show that the autonomic controller successfully synchronizes video for small groups of distributed clients and, at the same time, enhances the video quality experienced by users, in conditions of fluctuating bandwidth and variable frame rate.

Edwards                    2004-12-20                    State assignment is a formidable task. As designs written in a hardware description language such as Esterel inherently carry more high level information that a register transfer level model, such information can be used to guide the encoding process. A question arises if the high level information alone is strong enough to suggest an efficient state assignment, allowing low-level details to be ignored.This report suggests that with Esterel's flexibility, most optimization potential is not within the high-level structure. It appears effective state assignment cannot rely solely on high level information.

Edwards, Chun Li                    2004-12-20                    Porting software usually requires understanding what library functions the program being ported uses since this functionality must be either found or reproduced in the ported program's new environment. This is usually done manually through code inspections. We propose a type inference algorithm able to infer basic information about the library functions a particular C program uses in the absence of declaration information for the library (e.g., without header files). Based on a simple but efficient inference algorithm, we were able to infer declarations for much of the PalmOS API from the source of a twenty-seven-thousand-line C program. Such a tool will aid in the problem of program understanding when porting programs, especially from poorly-documented or lost legacy environments.

Keromytis                    2004-12-11                    Software that covertly monitors user actions, also known as {\\it\rspyware,} has become a first-level security threat due to its ubiquity\rand the difficulty of detecting and removing it. Such software may be\rinadvertently installed by a user that is casually browsing the web,\ror may be purposely installed by an attacker or even the owner of a\rsystem. This is particularly problematic in the case of utility\rcomputing, early manifestations of which are Internet cafes and\rthin-client computing. Traditional trusted computing approaches offer\ra partial solution to this by significantly increasing the size of the\rtrusted computing base (TCB) to include the operating system and other\rsoftware.\r\rWe examine the problem of protecting a user accessing specific\rservices in such an environment. We focus on secure video broadcasts\rand remote desktop access when using any convenient, and often\runtrusted, terminal as two example applications.  We posit that, at\rleast for such applications, the TCB can be confined to a suitably\rmodified graphics processing unit (GPU). Specifically, to prevent\rspyware on untrusted clients from accessing the user's data, we\rrestrict the boundary of trust to the client's GPU by moving image\rdecryption into GPUs. We use the GPU in order to leverage existing\rcapabilities as opposed to designing a new component from scratch.\rWe discuss the applicability of GPU-based\rdecryption in these two sample scenarios and identify the limitations\rof the current generation of GPUs. We propose straightforward\rmodifications to future GPUs that will allow the realization of the\rfull approach.

In such cases, there is a high risk of collision with possible undetected obstacles. The proposed method, adapted for use in urban outdoors environments, minimizes such risks while guiding the robot towards a predefined target location. During the process, a compact and accurate representation of the environment can be obtained.

We look into ITU Q.1211 services, AT&T 5ESS switch services, services defined in CSTA Phase III, and new services integrating other Internet services, such as presence information. We also explore how to use the Language for End System Services (LESS) to program the services.

WebPod leverages capacity improvements in portable solid state memory devices to provide a consistent environment to access the web. WebPod provides a thin virtualization layer that decouples a user's web session from any particular end-user device, allowing users freedom to move their work environments around. We have implemented a prototype in Linux that works with existing unmodified applications and operating system kernels. Our experimental results demonstrate that WebPod has very low virtualization overhead and can provide a full featured web browsing experience, including support for all helper applications and plug-ins one expects. WebPod is able to efficiently migrate a user's web session. This enables improved user mobility while maintaining a consistent work environment.

Edwards                    2004-11-17                    After a few decades of research and experimentation, register-transfer dialects of two standard languages---Verilog and VHDL---have emerged as the industry standard starting point for automatic large-scale digital integrated circuit synthesis. Writing RTL descriptions of hardware remains a largely human process and hence the clarity, precision, and ease with which such descriptions can be coded correctly has a profound impact on the quality of the final product and the speed with which the design can be created.While the efficiency of a design (e.g., the speed at which it can run or the power it consumes) is obviously important, its correctness is usually the paramount issue, consuming the majority of the time (and hence money) spent during the design process. In response to this challenge, a number of so-called verification languages have arisen. These have been designed to assist in a simulation-based or formal verification process by providing mechanisms for checking temporal properties, generating pseudorandom test cases, and for checking how much of a design's behavior has been exercised by the test cases.Through examples and discussion, this report describes the two main design languages---VHDL and Verilog---as well as SystemC, a language currently used to build large simulation models; SystemVerilog, a substantial extension of Verilog; and OpenVera, e, and PSL, the three leading contenders for becoming the main verification language.

Extraction of \"useful and relevant\" content from web pages has many applications, including cell phone and PDA browsing, speech rendering for the visually impaired, reducing noise for information retrieval systems and to generally improve the web browsing experience. In our previous work [16], we developed a framework that employed an easily extensible set of techniques that incorporated results from our earlier work on content extraction [16]. Our insight was to work with DOM trees, rather than raw HTML markup. We present here filters that reduce human involvement in applying heuristic settings for websites and instead automate the job by detecting and utilizing the physical layout and content genre of a given website. We also present work we have done towards improving the usability and performance of our content extraction proxy as well as the quality and accuracy of the heuristics that act as filters for inferring the context of a webpage.

This is achieved at the cost of higher latency for locating the resources of interest in the P2P overlay network. Internet telephony can be viewed as an application of P2P architecture where the participants form a self-organizing P2P overlay network to locate and communicate with other participants. We propose a pure P2P architecture for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based IP telephony systems. Our P2P-SIP architecture supports basic user registration and call setup as well as advanced services such as offline message delivery, voice/video mails and multi-party conferencing. We also provide an overview of practical challenges for P2P-SIP such as firewall, Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal and security.

It will be a great help to users if their desired services can be created automatically. We developed an intelligent communication service creation environment which can handle automatic service creation by learning from users' daily communication behaviors. The service creation environment models communication services as decision trees and uses the Incremental Tree Induction (ITI) algorithm for decision tree learning. We use Language for End System Services (LESS) scripts to represent learned results and implemented a simulation environment to verify the learning algorithm. We also noticed that when users get their desired services, they may not be aware of unexpected behaviors that the serivces could introduce, for example, mistakenly rejecting expected calls. In this paper, we also did a comprehensive analysis on communication service fail-safe handling and propose several approaches to create fail-safe services.

Allen, Ting Song, Andrew Laine, William Edstrom, John Hunt                    2004-10-28                    We present a microrobotic system for protein crystal micromanipulation\rtasks.  The focus in this report is on a task called streak seeding,\rwhich is used by crystallographers to entice certain protein crystals\rto grow.  Our system features a set of custom designed micropositioner\rend-effectors we call microshovels to replace traditional tools used\rby crystallographers for this task.  We have used micro-electrical\rmechanical system (MEMS) techniques to design and manufacture various\rshapes and quantities of microshovels.  Visual feedback from a camera\rmounted on the microscope is used to control the micropositioner as it\rlowers a microshovel into the liquid containing the crystals for poking\rand streaking.  We present experimental results that illustrate the\rapplicability of our approach.

As is evident from the fate of email, protection against spam has to be built into SIP systems otherwise they are bound to fall prey to spam. Traditional approaches used to prevent spam in email such as content-based filtering and access lists are not applicable to SIP calls and instant messages in their present form. We propose Domain-based Authentication and Policy-Enforced for SIP (DAPES): a system that can be easily implemented and deployed in existing SIP networks. Our system is capable of determining in real time, whether an incoming call or instant message is likely to be spam or not, while at the same time, supporting communication between both known and unknown parties. DAPES includes the deployment of reputation systems in SIP networks to enable real-time transfer of reputation information between parties to allow communication between entities unknown to each other.

These services require a service programming architecture that can easily incorporate new Internet services into the existing conferencing functionalities, such as voice-enabled conference control. W3C has defined the Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML), along with its VoiceXML, for telephony call control services in a point-to-point call. However, it cannot handle other Internet service events such as presence enabled conferences. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining VoiceXML with our Language for End System Services (LESS) and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for multi-party conference service programming that integrates existing Internet services. VoiceXML provides the voice interface to LESS and CGI scripts. Our architecture enables many novel services such as conference setup based on participant location and presence status. We give some examples of the new services and describe our on-going implementation.

Baset, Henning Schulzrinne                    2004-10-11                    Skype is a peer-to-peer VoIP client developed by KaZaa in 2003. Skype claims that it can work almost seamlessly across NATs and firewalls and has better voice quality than the MSN and Yahoo IM applications. It encrypts calls end-to-end, and stores user information in a decentralized fashion. Skype also supports instant messaging and conferencing. This report analyzes key Skype functions such as login, NAT and firewall traversal, call establishment, media transfer, codecs, and conferencing under three different network setups. Analysis is performed by careful study of Skype network traffic.

Locasto, Stephen W. Boyd, Angelos D. Keromytis                    2004-10-10                    We propose a new approach for reacting to a wide variety of software failures, ranging from remotely exploitable vulnerabilities to more mundane bugs that cause abnormal program termination (e.g., illegal memory dereference). Our emphasis is in creating \"self-healing\" software that can protect itself against a recurring fault until a more comprehensive fix is applied.Our system consists of a set of sensors that monitor applications for various types of failure and an instruction-level emulator that is invoked for selected parts of a program's code. Use of such an emulator allows us to predict recurrences of faults, and recover program execution to a safe control flow. Using the emulator for small pieces of code, as directed by the sensors, allows us to minimize the performance impact on the immunized application.We discuss the overall system architecture and a prototype implementation for the x86 platform. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach against a range of attacks and other software failures and investigate its performance impact on several server-type applications. We conclude that our system is effective in preventing the recurrence of a wide variety of software failures at a small performance cost.

Edwards                    2004-10-04                    In this paper, we present a performance comparison of two linux live CD distributions, Knoppix (v.3.3) and Quantian (v 0.4.96). The library used for performance evaluation is the Parallel Image Processing Toolkit (PIPT), a software library that contains several parallel image processing routines. A set of images was chosen and a batch job of PIPT routines were run and timed using both live CD distributions. The point of comparison between the two live CDs was the total time the batch job required for completion.

Anderson, A. Stephen Morse, Peter N. Belhumeur                    2004-09-29                    This paper is concerned with rigid formations of mobile autonomous agents using a leader-follower structure. A formation is a group of agents moving in real 2- or 3- dimensional space. A formation is called rigid if the distance between each pair of agents does not change over time under ideal conditions. Sensing/communication links between agents are used to maintain a rigid formation. Two agents connected by a sensing/communication link are called neighbors. There are two types of neighbor relations in rigid formations. In the first type, the neighbor relation is symmetric. In the second type, the neighbor relation is asymmetric. Rigid formations with a leader-follower structure have the asymmetric neighbor relation. A framework to analyze rigid formations with symmetric neighbor relations is given in our previous work. This paper suggests an approach to analyze rigid formations that have a leader-follower structure.

McKeown                    2004-09-29                    This paper explores new-information detection, describing a strategy for filtering a stream of documents to present only information that is fresh. We focus on multi-document summarization and seek to efficiently use more linguistic information than is often seen in such systems. We experimented with our linguistic system and with a more traditional sentence-based, vector-space system and found that a combination of the two approaches boosted performance over each one alone.

McKeown                    2004-09-29                    This paper explores a combination of machine learning, approximate text segmentation and a vector-space model to distinguish novel information from repeated information. In experiments with the data from the Novelty Track at the Text Retrieval Conference, we show improvements over a variety of approaches, in particular in raising precision scores on this data, while maintaining a reasonable amount of recall.

For TCP, we also do experiments using TCP NODELAY which sends out requests immediately. We compare the performance of different protocols by their 90th percentile delay and jitter. The performance of UDP is better than that of TCP NODELAY and the performance TCP NODELAY is better than that of TCP. We also explore the relation between TCP delay time minus the transmission time and the packet loss rate and find there is a linear relationship between them.

Keromytis                    2004-09-13                    We examine the problem of containing buffer overflow attacks in a safe and efficient manner. Briefly, we automatically augment source code to dynamically catch stack and heap-based buffer overflow and underflow attacks, and recover from them by allowing the program to continue execution. Our hypothesis is that we can treat each code function as a transaction that can be aborted when an attack is detected, without affecting the application's ability to correctly execute. Our approach allows us to selectively enable or disable components of this defensive mechanism in response to external events, allowing for a direct tradeoff between security and performance. We combine our defensive mechanism with a honeypot-like con guration to detect previously unknown attacks and automatically adapt an application's defensive posture at a negligible performance cost, as well as help determine a worm's signature. The main benefits of our scheme are its low impact on application performance, its ability to respond to attacks without human intervention, its capacity to handle previously unknown vulnerabilities, and the preservation of service availability. We implemented a stand-alone tool, DYBOC, which we use to instrument a number of vulnerable applications. Our performance benchmarks indicate a slow-down of 20% for Apache in full-protection mode, and 1.2% with partial protection. We validate our transactional hypothesis via two experiments: first, by applying our scheme to 17 vulnerable applications, successfully fixing 14 of them; second, by examining the behavior of Apache when each of 154 potentially vulnerable routines are made to fail, resulting in correct behavior in 139 of cases.

Belhumeur                    2004-09-13                    In this paper we provide a theoretical foundation for the problem of network localization in which some nodes know their locations and other nodes determine their locations by measuring distances or bearings to their neighbors. Distance information is the separation between two nodes connected by a sensing/communication link. Bearing is the angle between a sensing/communication link and the x-axis of a node's local coordinate system. We construct grounded graphs to model network localization and apply graph rigidity theory and parallel drawings to test the conditions for unique localizability and to construct uniquely localizable networks. We further investigate partially localizable networks.

Ipeirotis, Alexandros Ntoulas, Junghoo Cho, Luis Gravano                    2004-08-12                    Large amounts of (often valuable) information are stored in web-accessible text databases. ``Metasearchers'' provide unified interfaces to query multiple such databases at once. For efficiency, metasearchers rely on succinct statistical summaries of the database contents to select the best databases for each query. So far, database selection research has largely assumed that databases are static, so the associated statistical summaries do not need to change over time. However, databases are rarely static and the statistical summaries that describe their contents need to be updated periodically to reflect content changes. In this paper, we first report the results of a study showing how the content summaries of 152 real web databases evolved over a period of 52 weeks. Then, we show how to use ``survival analysis'' techniques in general, and Cox's proportional hazards regression in particular, to model database changes over time and predict when we should update each content summary. Finally, we exploit our change model to devise update schedules that keep the summaries up to date by contacting databases only when needed, and then we evaluate the quality of our schedules experimentally over real web databases.

Ishak, Steven Feiner                    2004-08-09                    We present a set of interaction techniques for a hybrid user interface that integrates existing 2D and 3D visualization and interaction devices. Our approach is built around one- and two-handed gestures that support the seamless transition of data between co-located 2D and 3D contexts. Our testbed environment combines a 2D multi-user, multi-touch, projection surface with 3D head-tracked, see-through, head-worn displays and 3D tracked gloves to form a multi-display augmented reality. We also address some of the ways in which we can interact with private data in a collaborative, heterogeneous workspace.

We present Group Ratio Round-Robin ($GR^3$), thefirst proportional share scheduler that combines accurateproportional fairness scheduling behavior with $O(1)$scheduling overhead on both uniprocessor and multiprocessorsystems. $GR^3$ uses a novel client grouping strategy toorganize clients into groups of similar processor allocationswhich can be more easily scheduled. Using this groupingstrategy, $GR^3$ combines the benefits of low overheadround-robin execution with a novel ratio-based schedulingalgorithm. $GR^3$ can provide fairness within a constantfactor of the ideal generalized processor sharing model forclient weights with a fixed upper bound and preserves itsfairness properties on multiprocessor systems. We haveimplemented $GR^3$ in Linux and measured its performanceagainst other schedulers commonly used in research andpractice, including the standard Linux scheduler, WeightedFair Queueing, Virtual-Time Round-Robin, and SmoothedRound-Robin. Our experimental results demonstrate that $GR^3$can provide much lower scheduling overhead and much betterscheduling accuracy in practice than these other approaches.

Baratto, Jason Nieh, Leo Kim                    2004-07-29                    Rapid improvements in network bandwidth, cost, and ubiquity combined with the security hazards and high total cost of ownership of personal computers have created a growing market for thin-client computing. We introduce THINC, a remote display system architecture for high-performance thin-client computing in both LAN and WAN environments. THINC transparently maps high-level application display calls to a few simple low-level commands which can be implemented easily and efficiently. THINC introduces a number of novel latency-sensitive optimization techniques, including offscreen drawing awareness, command buffering and scheduling, non-blocking display operation, native video support, and server-side screen scaling. We have implemented THINC in an XFree86/Linux environment and compared its performance with other popular approaches, including Citrix MetaFrame, Microsoft Terminal Services, SunRay, VNC, and X. Our experimental results on web and video applications demonstrate that THINC can be as much as five times faster than traditional thin-client systems in high latency network environments and is capable of playing full-screen video at full frame rate.

Since accurate rendering of shadows from environment maps requires hundreds of lights, the expensive computation is determining visibility from each pixel to each light direction, such as by ray-tracing. We show that coherence in both spatial and angular domains can be used to reduce the number of shadow rays that need to be traced. Specifically, we use a coarse-to-fine evaluation of the image, predicting visibility by reusing visibility calculations from four nearby pixels that have already been evaluated. This simple method allows us to explicitly mark regions of uncertainty in the prediction. By only tracing rays in these and neighboring directions, we are able to reduce the number of shadow rays traced by up to a factor of 20 while maintaining error rates below 0.01\\%. For many scenes, our algorithm can add shadowing from hundreds of lights at twice the cost of rendering without shadows.

One major bottleneck to the further advancement of clock-less design is the lack of optimizing CAD (computer-aided design) algorithms and tools. In synchronous design, CAD packages have been crucial to the advancement of the microelectronics industry. In fact, automated methods seem to be even more crucial for asynchronous design, which is widely considered as being much more error-prone.This thesis proposes several new efficient CAD techniques for the design of asynchronous control circuits. The contributions include: (i) two new and very efficient algorithms for hazard-free two-level logic minimization, including a heuristic algorithm, ESPRESSO-HF, and an exact algorithm based on implicit data structures, IMPYMIN; and (ii) a new synthesis and optimization method for large-scale asynchronous systems, which starts from a Control-Dataflow Graph (CDFG), and produces highly-optimized distributed control.As a case study, this latter method is applied to a differential equation solver; the resulting synthesized circuit is comparable in quality to a highly-optimized manual design.

Servedio                    2004-05-26                    In this note we prove that a monotone boolean function computable by a decision tree of size $s$ has average sensitivity at most $\\sqrt{\\log_2 s}$. As a consequence we show that monotone functions are learnable to constant accuracy under the uniform distribution in time polynomial in their decision tree size.

Much of that complexity is related to ensuring adequate quality levels to services provided by software systems after they are deployed in the field, in particular when those systems are built from and operated as a mix of proprietary and non-proprietary components. That translates to increasing costs and difficulties when trying to operate large-scale distributed software ensembles in a way that continuously guarantees satisfactory levels of service.A solution can be to exert some form of dynamic adaptation upon running software systems: dynamic adaptation can be defined as a set of automated and coordinated actions that aim at modifying the structure, behavior and performance of a target software system, at run time and without service interruption, typically in response to the occurrence of some condition(s). To achieve dynamic adaptation upon a given target software system, a set of capabilities, including monitoring, diagnostics, decision, actuation and coordination, must be put in place.This research addresses the automation of decision and coordination in the context of an end-to-end and externalized approach to dynamic adaptation, which allows to address as its targets legacy and component-based systems, as well as new systems developed from scratch. In this approach, adaptation provisions are superimposed by a separate software platform, which operates from the outside of and orthogonally to the target application as a whole; furthermore, a single adaptation possibly spans concerted interventions on a multiplicity of target components. To properly orchestrate those interventions, decentralized process technology is employed for describing, activating and coordinating the work of a cohort of software actuators, towards the intended end-to-end dynamic adaptation.The approach outlined above, has been implemented in a prototype, code-named Workflakes, within the Kinesthetics eXtreme project investigating externalized dynamic adaptation, carried out by the Programming Systems Laboratory of Columbia University, and has been employed in a set of diverse case studies. This dissertation discusses and evaluates the concept of process-based orchestration of dynamic adaptation and the Workflakes prototype on the basis of the results of those case studies.

Cook,  Moti Yung, , Angelos Keromytis                    2004-05-19                    We discuss the elastic versions of block ciphers whose round function processes subsets of bits from the data block differently, such as occurs in a Feistel network and in MISTY1. We focus on how specific bits are selected to be swapped after each round when forming the elastic version, using an elastic version of MISTY1 and differential cryptanalysis to illustrate why this swap step must be carefully designed. We also discuss the benefit of adding initial and final key dependent permutations in all elastic block ciphers. The implementation of the elastic version of MISTY1 is analyzed from a performance perspective.

However, this scalability comes at the expense of increased vulnerability to specific types of attacks. In this paper, we focus on insider denial of service (DoS) attacks on such systems. In these attacks, nodes that are part of the DHT system are compromised and used to flood other nodes in the DHT with excessive request traffic.We devise a distributed lightweight protocol that detects such attacks, implemented solely within nodes that participate in the DHT. Our approach exploits inherent structural invariants of DHTs to ferret out attacking nodes whose request patterns deviate from ``normal'' behavior. We evaluate our protocol's ability to detect attackers via simulation within a Chord network. The results show that our system can detect a simple attacker whose attack traffic deviates by as little as 5\\% from a normal request traffic. We also demonstrate the resiliency of our protocol to coordinated attacks by up to as many as 25\\% of nodes. Our work shows that DHTs can protect themselves from insider flooding attacks, eliminating an important roadblock to their deployment and use in untrusted environments.

Bui,  Ryan Ferst, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    2004-04-24                    We describe an anomaly detector, called FWRAP, for a Host-based Intrusion Detection System that monitors file system calls to detect anomalous accesses. The system is intended to be used not as a standalone detector but one of a correlated set of host-based sensors. The detector has two parts, a sensor that audits file systems accesses, and an unsupervised machine learning system that computes normal models of those accesses.We report on the architecture of the file system sensor implemented on Linux using the FiST file wrapper technology and results of the anomaly detector applied to experimental data acquired from this sensor. FWRAP employs the Probabilistic Anomaly Detection (PAD) algorithm previously reported in our work on Windows Registry Anomaly Detection. The detector is first trained by operating the host computer for some amount of time and a model specific to the target machine is automatically computed by PAD, intended to be deployed to a real-time detector. In this paper we describe the feature set used to model file system accesses, and the performance results of a set of experiments using the sensor while attacking a Linux host with a variety of malware exploits. The PAD detector achieved impressive detection rates in some cases over 95\\% and about a 2\\% false positive rate when alarming on anomalous processes.

Examples include IBM's Autonomic Computing, HP's Adaptive Infrastructure, and Microsoft's Dynamic Systems Initiative. All of these efforts seek to reduce operations costs by increased automation, ideally to have systems be self-managing without any human intervention (since operator error has been identified as a major source of system failures). While the concept of automated operations has existed for two decades, as a way to adapt to changing workloads, failures and (more recently) attacks, the scope of automation remains limited. We believe this is in part due to the absence of a fundamental understanding of how automated actions affect system behavior, especially system stability.\rOther disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and aeronautical engineering make use of control theory to design feedback systems. This paper uses control theory as a way to identify a number of requirements for and challenges in building self-managing systems,\reither from new components or layering on top of existing components.

In particular, one must consider the multiple scattering of light within the volume. Recently, we presented a path integral-based approach to this problem which identifies the most probable path light takes in the medium and approximates energy transport over all paths by only those surrounding this most probable one. In this report we use the same approach to derive useful expressions for the amount of spacial and angular blurring light experiences as it travels through a medium.

Nayar                    2004-03-25                    Video cameras must produce images at a reasonable frame-rate and with a reasonable depth of field. These requirements impose fundamental physical limits on the spatial resolution of the image detector. As a result, current cameras produce videos with a very low resolution. The resolution of videos can be computationally enhanced by moving the camera and applying super-resolution reconstruction algorithms. However, a moving camera introduces motion blur, which limits super-resolution quality. We analyze this effect and derive a theoretical result showing that motion blur has a substantial degrading effect on the performance of super resolution. The conclusion is, that in order to achieve the highest resolution, motion blur should be avoided.Motion blur can be minimized by sampling the space-time volume of the video in a specific manner. We have developed a novel camera, called the jitter camera, that achieves this sampling. By applying an adaptive super-resolution algorithm to the video produced by the jitter camera, we show that resolution can be notably enhanced for stationary or slowly moving objects, while it is improved slightly or left unchanged for objects with fast and complex motions. The end result is a video that has a significantly higher resolution than the captured one.

Edwards                    2004-03-22                    We present a new procedure for automatically synthesizing controllers from high-level Esterel specifications. Unlike existing \\textsc{rtl} synthesis approaches, this approach frees the designer from tedious bit-level state encoding and certain types of inter-machine communication. Experimental results suggest that even with a fairly primitive state assignment heuristic, our compiler consistently produces smaller, slightly faster circuits that the existing Esterel compiler. We mainly attribute this to a different style of distributing state bits throughout the circuit. Initial results are encouraging, but some hand-optimized encodings suggest room for a better state assignment algorithm. We are confident that such improvements will make our technique even more practical.

MobiDesk transparently virtualizes a user's computing session by abstracting underlying system resources in three key areas: display, operating system and network. MobiDesk provides a thin virtualization layer that decouples a user's computing session from any particular end user device and moves all application logic from end user devices to hosting providers. MobiDesk virtualization decouples a user's computing session from the underlying operating system and server instance, enabling high availability service by transparently migrating sessions from one server to another during server maintenance or upgrades. We have implemented a MobiDesk prototype in Linux that works with existing unmodified applications and operating system kernels. Our experimental results demonstrate that MobiDesk has very low virtualization overhead, can provide a full-featured desktop experience including full-motion video support, and is able to migrate users' sessions efficiently and reliably for high availability, while maintaining existing network connections.

Ipeirotis, Luis Gravano                    2004-03-17                    Database selection is an important step when searching over large numbers of distributed text databases. The database selection task relies on statistical summaries of the database contents, which are not typically exported by databases. Previous research has developed algorithms for constructing an approximate content summary of a text database from a small document sample extracted via querying. Unfortunately, Zipf's law practically guarantees that content summaries built this way for any relatively large database will fail to cover many low-frequency words. Incomplete content summaries might negatively affect the database selection process, especially for short queries with infrequent words. To improve the coverage of approximate content summaries, we build on the observation that topically similar databases tend to have related vocabularies. Therefore, the approximate content summaries of topically related databases can complement each other and increase their coverage. Specifically, we exploit a (given or derived) hierarchical categorization of the databases and adapt the notion of ``shrinkage'' --a form of smoothing that has been used successfully for document classification-- to the content summary construction task. A thorough evaluation over 315 real web databases as well as over TREC data suggests that the shrinkage-based content summaries are substantially more complete than their ``unshrunk'' counterparts. We also describe how to modify existing database selection algorithms to adaptively decide --at run-time-- whether to apply shrinkage for a query. Our experiments, which rely on TREC data sets, queries, and the associated ``relevance judgments,'' show that our shrinkage-based approach is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art database selection algorithms, including a recently proposed hierarchical strategy that also exploits database classification.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                 (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Collaborative Distributed Intrusion Detection                                        Michael E. Locasto,  Janak J. Parekh,  Sal, Vishal Misra                    2004-03-08                    The rapidly increasing array of Internet-scale threats is a pressing problem for every organization that utilizes the network. Organizations often have limited resources to detect and respond to these threats. The sharing of information related to probes and attacks is a facet of an emerging trend toward \"collaborative security.\" Collaborative security mechanisms provide network administrators with a valuable tool in this increasingly hostile environment.The perceived benefit of a collaborative approach to intrusion detection is threefold: greater clarity about attacker intent, precise models of adversarial behavior, and a better view of global network attack activity. While many organizations see value in adopting such a collaborative approach, several critical problems must be addressed before intrusion detection can be performed on an inter-organizational scale. These obstacles to collaborative intrusion detection often go beyond the merely technical; the relationships between cooperating organizations impose additional constraints on the amount and type of information to be shared.We propose a completely decentralized system that can efficiently distribute alerts to each collaborating peer. The system is composed of two major components that embody the main contribution of our research. The first component, named Worminator, is a tool for extracting relevant information from alert streams and encoding it in Bloom filters. The second component, Whirlpool, is a software system for scheduling correlation relationships between peer nodes. The combination of these systems accomplishes alert distribution in a scalable manner and without violating the privacy of each administrative domain.

The paper compares various failover and load sharing methods for registration and call routing servers based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In particular, we consider the SIP server failover techniques based on the clients, DNS (Domain Name Service), database replication and IP address takeover, and the load sharing techniques using DNS, SIP identifiers, network address translators and servers with same IP addresses. Additionally, we present an overview of the failover mechanism we implemented in our test-bed using our SIP proxy and registration server and the open source MySQL database.

Conventional educational materials from heterogeneous backend data sources are reflected in the virtual world through an automated metadata extraction and projection process that structurally organizes container materials into rooms and interconnecting doors, with atomic objects within containers depicted as furnishings and decorations. A novel in-world authoring tool makes it easy for instructors to design environments, with additional in-world modification afforded to the students themselves, in both cases without programming. Specialized educational services can also be added to virtual environments via programmed plugins. We present an example plugin that supports synchronized viewing of lecture videos by groups of students with widely varying bandwidths.

In addition, the introduction of lecture videos into the online curriculum has drawn attention to the disparity in the network resources used by the students. We present an architecture and adaptation model called AI2TV (Adaptive Internet Interactive Team Video), a system that allows geographically dispersed participants, possibly some or all disadvantaged in network resources, to collaboratively view a video in synchrony. AI2TV upholds the invariant that each participant will view semantically equivalent content at all times. Video player actions, like play, pause and stop, can be initiated by any of the participants and the results of those actions are seen by all the members. These features allow group members to review a lecture video in tandem to facilitate the learning process. We employ an autonomic (feedback loop) controller that monitors clients' video status and adjusts the quality of the video according to the resources of each client. We show in experimental trials that our system can successfully synchronize video for distributed clients while, at the same time, optimizing the video quality given actual (fluctuating) bandwidth by adaptively adjusting the quality level for each participant.

Cook,  Moti Yung, , Angelos Keromytis                    2004-02-25                    We introduce a new concept of elastic block ciphers, symmetric-key encryption algorithms that for a variable size input do not expand the plaintext, (i.e., do not require plaintext padding), while maintaining the diffusion property of traditional block ciphers and adjusting their computational load proportionally to the size increase. Elastic block ciphers are ideal for applications where length-preserving encryption is most beneficial, such as protecting variable-length database entries or network packets.We present a general algorithmic schema for converting a traditional block cipher, such as AES, to its elastic version, and analyze the security of the resulting cipher. Our approach allows us to ``stretch'' the supported block size of a block cipher up to twice the original length, while increasing the computational load proportionally to the block size. Our approach does not allow us to use the original cipher as a ``black box'' (i.e., as an ideal cipher or a pseudorandom permutation as is used in constructing modes of encryption). Nevertheless, under some reasonable conditions on the cipher's structure and its key schedule, we reduce the security of the elastic version to that of the fixed size block cipher. This schema and the security reduction enable us to capitalize on secure ciphers and their already established security properties in elastic designs. We note that we are not aware of previous ``reduction type'' proofs of security in the area of concrete (i.e., non ``black-box'') block cipher design. Our implementation of the elastic version of AES, which accepts blocks of all sizes in the range 128 to 255 bits, was measured to be almost twice as fast when encrypting plaintext that is only a few bits longer than a full block (A128 bits), when compared to traditional ``pad and block-encrypt'' approach.

DotSlash allows different web sites to form a mutual-aid community, and use spare capacity in the community to relieve web hotspots experienced by any individual site. As a rescue system, DotSlash intervenes when a web site becomes heavily loaded, and is phased out once the workload returns to normal. It aims to complement existing web server infrastructure such as CDNs to handle short-term load spikes effectively, but is not intended to support a request load constantly higher than a web site's planned capacity. DotSlash is scalable, cost-effective, easy to use, self-configuring, and transparent to clients. It targets small web sites, although large web site can also benefit from it. We have implemented a prototype of DotSlash on top of Apache. Experiments show that DotSlash can provide an order of magnitude improvement for a web server in terms of the request rate supported and the data rate delivered to clients even if only HTTP redirect is used. Parts of this work may be applicable to other services such as the Grid computational services and media streaming.

Even when software updates are applied to address security issues, they often result in system services being unavailable for some time. To address these system security and availability issues, we have developed peas and pods. A pea provides a least privilege environment that can restrict processes to the minimal subset of system resources needed to run. This mechanism enables the creation of environments for privileged program execution that can help with intrusion prevention and containment. A pod provides a group of processes and associated users with a consistent, machine-independent virtualized environment. Pods are coupled with a novel checkpoint-restart mechanism which allows processes to be migrated across minor operating system kernel versions with different security patches. This mechanism allows system administrators the flexibility to patch their operating systems immediately without worrying over potential loss of data or needing to schedule system downtime. We have implemented peas and pods in Linux without requiring any application or operating system kernel changes. Our measurements on real world desktop and server applications demonstrate that peas and pods impose little overhead and enable secure isolation and migration of untrusted applications.

Different services may interfere with each other, a problem which is known as feature interaction. The feature interaction problem has existed in telecommunication systems for many years. The introduction of Internet telephony helps to solve some interaction problems due to the richness of its signaling information. However, many new feature interaction problems are also introduced in Internet telephony systems, especially in end systems, which are usually dumb in PSTN systems, but highly functional in Internet telephony systems. Internet telephony end systems, such as SIP soft-agents, can run on personal computers. The soft-agents can then perform call control and many other functions, such as presence information handling, instant messaging, and network appliance control. These new functionalities make the end system feature interaction problems more complicated. In this paper, we investigate ways features interact in Internet telephony end systems and propose a potential solution for detecting and avoiding feature interactions. Our solutions are based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Language for End System Services (LESS), which is a markup language specifically for end system service creation.

Werschulz                    2004-01-21                    We study the complexity of Fredholm problems of the second kind $u - \\int_\\Omega k(\\cdot,y)u(y)\\,dy = f$. Previous work on the complexity of this problem has assumed that $\\Omega$ was the unit cube~$I^d$. In this paper, we allow~$\\Omega$ to be part of the data specifying an instance of the problem, along with~$k$ and~$f$. More precisely, we assume that $\\Omega$ is the diffeomorphic image of the unit $d$-cube under a $C^{r_1}$ mapping~$\\rho\\:I^d\\to I^l$. In addition, we assume that $k\\in C^{r_2}(I^{2l})$ and $f\\in W^{r_3,p}(I^l)$ with $r_3>l/p$. Our information about the problem data is contaminated by $\\delta$-bounded noise. Error is measured in the $L_p$-sense. We find that the $n$th minimal error is bounded from below by $\\Theta(n^{-\\mu_1}+\\delta)$ and from above by $\\Theta(n^{-\\mu_2}+\\delta)$, where $$\\mu_1 = \\min\\left\\{\\frac{r_1}{d}, \\frac{r_2}{2d}, \\frac{r_3-(d-l)/p}d\\right\\} \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\mu_2 = \\min\\left\\{\\frac{r_1-\\nu}d, \\frac{r_2}{2d}, \\frac{r_3-(l-d)/p}d\\right\\},$$ with $$\\nu = \\begin{cases} \\displaystyle\\frac{d}p & \\text{if $r_1\\ge 2$, $r_2\\ge2$, and $d\\le p$},\\\\ & \\\\ 1 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}$$ In particular, the $n$th minimal error is proportional to $\\Theta(n^{-\\mu_1}+\\delta)$ when $p=\\infty$. The upper bound is attained by a noisy modified Galerkin method, which can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. We thus find bounds on the $\\varepsilon$-complexity of the problem, these bounds depending on the cost $\\mathbf{c}(\\delta)$ of calculating a $\\delta$-noisy function value. As an example, if $\\mathbf{c}(\\delta)=\\delta^{-b}$, we find that the $\\varepsilon$-complexity is between $(1/\\varepsilon)^{b+1/\\mu_1}$ and $(1/\\varepsilon)^{b+1/\\mu_2}$.

Cook,  John Ioannidis,  Angelos D, Jake Luck                    2004-01-13                    One frequently cited reason for the lack of wide deployment of cryptographic protocols is the (perceived) poor performance of the algorithms they employ and their impact on the rest of the system. Although high-performance dedicated cryptographic accelerator cards have been commercially available for some time, market penetration remains low. We take a different approach, seeking to exploit {\\it existing system resources,} such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate cryptographic processing.We exploit the ability for GPUs to simultaneously process large quantities of pixels to offload cryptographic processing from the main processor. We demonstrate the use of GPUs for stream ciphers, which can achieve 75\\% the performance of a fast CPU. We also investigate the use of GPUs for block ciphers, discuss operations that make certain ciphers unsuitable for use with a GPU, and compare the performance of an OpenGL-based implementation of AES with implementations utilizing general CPUs. In addition to offloading system resources, the ability to perform encryption and decryption within the GPU has potential applications in image processing by limiting exposure of the plaintext to within the GPU.                                                                                         (pdf)                                                 (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Automating Content Extraction of HTML Documents                                        Suhit Gupta,  Gail Kaiser,  Peter Grimm,  M, Justin Starren                    2004-01-06                    Web pages often contain clutter (such as unnecessary images and extraneous links) around the body of an article that distracts a user from actual content. Extraction of \"useful and relevant\" content from web pages has many applications, including cell phone and PDA browsing, speech rendering for the visually impaired, and text summarization. Most approaches to making content more readable involve changing font size or removing HTML and data components such as images, which takes away from a webpage's inherent look and feel. Unlike \"Content Reformatting\", which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses \"Content Extraction\". We have developed a framework that employs an easily extensible set of techniques. It incorporates advantages of previous work on content extraction. Our key insight is to work with DOM trees, a W3C specified interface that allows programs to dynamically access document structure, rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly available Web proxy to extract content from HTML web pages. This proxy can be used both centrally, administered for groups of users, as well as by individuals for personal browsers. We have also, after receiving feedback from users about the proxy, created a revised version with improved performance and accessibility in mind.

Locasto                    2003-11-26                    Like e--mail, instant messaging (IM) has become an integral part of life in a networked society. Until recently, IM software has been lax about providing confidentiality and integrity of these conversations.With the introduction of AOL's version 5.2.3211 of the AIM client, users can optionally encrypt and protect the integrity of their conversation. Taking advantage of the encryption capabilities of the AIM client requires that signed certificates for both parties be available. AIM (through VeriSign) makes such certificates available for purchase. However, in a ``public service'' effort to defray the cost of purchasing personal certificates to protect IM conversations, a website (www.aimencrypt.com) is offering a certificate free of cost for download. Unfortunately, the provided certificate is the same for everyone; this mistake reveals the dangers of a public undereducated about computer security, especially public key cryptography.

Keromytis                    2003-11-19                    The ability of worms to spread at rates that effectively preclude human-directed reaction has elevated them to a first-class security threat to distributed systems. We propose an architecture for automatically repairing software flaws that are exploited by zero-day worms.Our approach relies on source code transformations to quickly apply automatically-created (and tested) localized patches to vulnerable segments of the targeted application. To determine these susceptible portions, we use a sandboxed instance of the application as a ``clean room'' laboratory that runs in parallel with the production system and exploit the fact that a worm must reveal its infection vector to achieve its goal ( i.e., further infection). We believe our approach to be the first end-point solution to the problem of malicious self-replicating code. The primary benefits of our approach are (a) its low impact on application performance, (b) its ability to respond to attacks without human intervention, and (c) its capacity to deal with zero-day worms (for which no known patches exist). Furthermore, our approach does not depend on a centralized update repository, which can be the target of a concerted attack similar to the Blaster worm. Finally, our approach can also be used to protect against lower intensity attacks, such as intrusion (``hack-in'') attempts. To experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we use our prototype implementation to test a number of applications with known vulnerabilities. Our preliminary results indicate a success rate of 82\\%, and a maximum repair time of 8.5 seconds.

DSTs extendnonlinear dynamical systems to an interactive groupscenario. Various individual processes interact as communitiesand sub-communities in a tree structure that is un-rolled intime. To accommodate nonlinear temporal activity, eachindividual leaf process is modeled as a dynamical systemcontaining discrete and/or continuous hidden states withdiscrete and/or Gaussian emissions. Subsequent, higher levelparent processes act like hidden Markov models that mediatethe interaction between leaf processes or between other parentprocesses in the hierarchy. Aggregator chains are parents ofthe child processes the combine and mediate, yielding acompact overall parameterization. We provide tractableinference and learning algorithms for arbitrary DSTstopologies via structured mean field. Experiments are shownfor real trajectory data of tracked American football playswhere a DST tracks players as dynamical systems mediated bytheir team processes mediated in turn by a top-level gameprocess.

It provides a distributed architecture forcollaboration using synchronous communications like multimediaconferencing, instant messaging, shared web-browsing, andasynchronous communications like discussion forums, sharedfiles, voice and video mails. It allows seamless integrationwith various communication means like telephones, IP phones,web and electronic mail. In addition, it provides value-addedservices such as call handling based on location informationand presence status. The paper discusses the media servicesneeded for collaborative environment, the components providedby CINEMA and the interaction among those components.

Most results to date,however, suggest ways to architect new software constructedfrom the ground up as autonomic systems, whereas in the realworld organizations continue to use stovepipe legacy systemsand/or build \"systems of systems\" that draw from a gamut ofdisparate technologies from numerous vendors. Our goal is toretrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally,without any need to understand, modify or even recompile thetarget system's code. We present an autonomic infrastructurethat operates similarly to active middleware, to explicitlyadd autonomic services to pre-existing systems via continualmonitoring and a feedback loop that performs, as needed,reconfiguration and/or repair. Our lightweight design andseparation of concerns enables easy adoption of individualcomponents, independent of the rest of the fullinfrastructure, for use with a large variety of targetsystems.

Despite many promising attempts, we believe itremains an unsolved problem. Here we present a method forscoring the content of summaries of any length against aweighted inventory of content units, which we refer to as apyramid. Our method is derived from empirical analysis ofhuman-generated summaries, and provides an informative metricfor human or machine-generated summaries.

Although SIPimplementations have not yet been widely deployed, the productportfolio is expanding rapidly. We describe a method to assessthe robustness of SIP implementation by describing a tool tofind vulnerabilities. We prepared the test material andcarried out tests against a sample set of existingimplementations. Results were reported to the vendors and thetest suite was made publicly available. Many of theimplementations available for evaluation failed to perform ina robust manner under the test. Some failures had informationsecurity implications, and should be consideredvulnerabilities.

However, efforts tocombine technology from these areas in a practical system forinformation access have been limited. In this paper, wepresent a system that integrates cutting-edge technology inthese areas to automatically collect news articles frommultiple sources, organize them and present them in bothhierarchical and text summary form.

Keromytis,  Janak Parekh,  Phil, Sal Stolfo                    2003-07-10                    We present SABER (Survivability Architecture:Block, Evade, React), a proposed survivability architecturethat blocks, evades and reacts to a variety of attacks byusing several security and survivability mechanisms in anautomated and coordinated fashion. Contrary to the ad hocmanner in which contemporary survivable systems arebuilt--using isolated, independent security mechanisms such asfirewalls, intrusion detection systems and softwaresandboxes--SABER integrates several different technologies inan attempt to provide a unified framework for responding tothe wide range of attacks malicious insiders and outsiders canlaunch.This coordinated multi-layer approach will be capable ofdefending against attacks targeted at various levels of thenetwork stack, such as congestion-based DoS attacks,software-based DoS or code-injection attacks, and others. Ourfundamental insight is that while multiple lines of defenseare useful, most conventional, uncoordinated approaches failto exploit the full range of available responses toincidents. By coordinating the response, the ability tosurvive even in the face of successful security breachesincreases substantially.We discuss the key components of SABER, how they will beintegrated together, and how we can leverage on the promisingresults of the individual components to improve survivabilityin a variety of coordinated attack scenarios. SABER iscurrently in the prototyping stages, with several interestingopen research topics.

This infrastructure is primarily targeted to pre-existing systems and thus operates outside the target application, without making assumptions about the target's implementation, internal communication/computation mechanisms, source code availability, etc. This paper assumes the existence of the monitoring and analysis components, presented elsewhere, and focuses on the mechanisms used to control and coordinate possibly complex repairs/reconfigurations to the target system. These mechanisms require lower level effectors somehow attached to the target system, so we briefly sketch one such facility (elaborated elsewhere). Our main contribution is the model, architecture, and implementation of Workflakes, the decentralized process engine we use to tailor, control, coordinate, etc. a cohort of such effectors. We have validated the Workflakes approach with case studies in several application domains. Due to space restrictions we concentrate primarily on one case study, briefly discuss a second, and only sketch others.

Most results to date, however, suggest ways toarchitect new software constructed from the ground up asautonomic systems, whereas in the real world organizationscontinue to use stovepipe legacy systems and/or build \"systemsof systems\" that draw from a gamut of new and legacycomponents involving disparate technologies from numerousvendors. Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing ontosuch systems, externally, without any need to understand ormodify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossibleto recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented asactive middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomicservices via an attached feedback loop that provides continualmonitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair. Ourlightweight design and separation of concerns enables easyadoption of individual components, as well as the fullinfrastructure, for use with a large variety of legacy, newsystems, and systems of systems.

GRR combines its groupingstrategy with a specialized round-robin scheduling algorithmthat utilizes the properties of GRR groups to schedule flowswithin groups in a manner that provides O(1) bounds onfairness with only O(1) time complexity. Under the practicalassumption that GRR employs a small constant number of groups,we apply GRR to popular fair queueing scheduling algorithmsand show how GRR can be used to achieve constant bounds onfairness and time complexity for these algorithms.

Grossberg, Shree K. Nayar                    2003-07-01                    New vision applications have been made possible and old ones improved through the creation and design of novel catadioptric systems. Critical to the design of catadioptric imaging is determining the shape of one or more mirrors in the system. Almost all the previously designed mirrors for catadioptric systems used case specific tools and considerable effort on the part of the designer. Recently some new general methods have been proposed to automate the design process. However, all the methods presented so far determine the mirror shape by optimizing its geometric properties, such as surface normal orientations. A more principled approach is to determine a mirror that reduces image errors.In this paper we present a method for finding mirror shapes which meet user determined specifications while minimizing image error. We accomplish this by deriving a first order approximation of the image error. This permits us to compute the mirror shape using a linear approach that provides good results efficiently while avoiding the numerical problems associated with non-linear optimization. Since the design of mirrors can also be applied to projection systems, we also provide a method to approximate projection errors in the scene. We demonstrate our approach on various catadioptric systems and show our approach to provide much more accurate imaging characteristics. In some cases we achieved reduction in image error up to 80 percent.

This information can be used forparameter control, as well as for disambiguating speechrecognition. We discuss how characteristics of the spokensentences can be exploited in the user interface; for example,by considering the speed with which the sentence was spokenand the presence of extraneous utterances. We also show howcoarse audio localization can be used for low-fidelity gesturetracking, by inferring the speaker's head position.

Duboue, Kathleen R. McKeown                    2003-05-30                    A Natural Language Generation system produces textusing as input semantic data. One of its very first tasks isto decide which pieces of information to convey in the output.This task, called Content Selection, is quite domaindependent, requiring considerable re-engineering to transportthe system from one scenario to another. In (Duboue andMcKeown, 2003), we presented a method to acquire contentselection rules automatically from a corpus of text andassociated semantics. Our proposed technique was evaluated bycomparing its output with information selected by humanauthors in unseen texts, where we were able to filter half theinput data set without loss of recall.

The system collects, clusters,and summarizes news documents from sources all over the worlddaily. It crawls news sites in many different countries,written in different languages, extracts the news text fromthe HTML pages, uses a variety of methods to translate thedocuments for clustering and summarization, and produces anEnglish summary for each cluster. The system is robust,running daily over real-world data. The multilingual versionof Columbia Newsblaster provides a platform for testingdifferent strategies for multilingual document clustering, andapproaches for multilingual multi-document summarization.

Recent work has examined the use offaceted classification for browsing and search. In thispaper, we go further by developing a general query language,called the entity algebra, for hierarchically classified data.The entity algebra is compositional, with query inputs andoutputs being sets of entities. Our language has linear datacomplexity in terms of space and quadratic data complexity interms of time. We compare the entity algebra with therelational algebra in terms of expressiveness. We alsodescribe an implementation of the language in the context oftwo application domains, one for an archeological database,and another for a human anatomy database.

However, previous proportional share mechanismshave either weak proportional sharing accuracy or highscheduling overhead. We present Group Ratio Round-Robin(GR3), a proportional share scheduler that can provide highproportional sharing accuracy with O(1) scheduling overhead.Unlike many other schedulers, a low-overhead GR3implementation is easy to build using simple data structures.We have implemented GR3 in Linux and measured its performanceagainst other schedulers commonly used in research andpractice, including the standard Linux scheduler, WeightedFair Queueing, Virtual-Time Round-Robin, and SmoothedRound-Robin.

Edwards                    2003-05-11                    Embedded systems are application-specificcomputers that interact with the physical world. Each has adiverse set of tasks to perform, and although a very flexiblelanguage might be able to handle all of them, instead avariety of problem-domain-specific languages have evolved thatare easier to write, analyze, and compile.This paper surveys some of the more important languages,introducing their central ideas quickly without going intodetail. A small example of each is included.

In many web applications, the relationattributes are only available via probes to autonomousweb-accessible sources. Probing these sources sequentially toprocess a top-k query is inefficient, since web accessesexhibit high and variable latency. Fortunately, web sourcescan be probed in parallel, and each source can typicallyprocess concurrent requests, although sources may impose somerestrictions on the type and number of probes that they arewilling to accept. These characteristics of web sourcesmotivate the introduction of parallel top-k query processingstrategies, which are the focus of this paper. We presentefficient techniques that maximize source-access parallelismto minimize query response time, while satisfying sourceaccess constraints. A thorough experimental evaluation overboth synthetic and real web sources shows that our techniquescan be significantly more efficient than previously proposedsequential strategies. In addition, we adapt our parallelalgorithms for the alternate optimization goal of minimizingsource load while still exploiting source-accessparallelism.

Ross                    2003-05-05                    We propose a new storage model called MBSM(Multi-resolution Block Storage Model) for laying out tableson disks. MBSM is intended to speed up operations such asscans that are typical of data warehouse workloads. Diskblocks are grouped into ``super-blocks,'' with a single recordstored in a partitioned fashion among the blocks in asuper-block. The intention is that a scan operation thatneeds to consult only a small number of attributes can accessjust those blocks of each super-block that contain the desiredattributes. To achieve good performance given the physicalcharacteristics of modern disks, we organize super-blocks onthe disk into fixed-size ``mega-blocks.'' Within amega-block, blocks of the same type (from varioussuper-blocks) are stored contiguously. We describe thechanges needed in a conventional database system to managetables using such a disk organization. We demonstrateexperimentally that MBSM outperforms competing approaches suchas NSM (N-ary Storage Model), DSM (Decomposition StorageModel) and PAX (Partition Attributes Across), for I/O bounddecision-support workloads consisting of scans in which notall attributes are required. This improved performance comesat the expense of single-record insert and delete performance;we quantify the trade-offs involved. Unlike DSM, the cost ofreconstructing a record from its partitions is small. MBSMstores attributes in a vertically partitioned manner similarto PAX, and thus shares PAX's good CPU cache behavior. Wedescribe methods for mapping attributes to blocks withinsuper-blocks in order to optimize overall performance, andshow how to tune the super-block and mega-block sizes.

We show how a set ofdefinitional predicates proposed as the knowledge-based sideof our approach can be used to guide the selection ofdefinitional sentences. Finally, we present results of anevaluation of definitions generated by DefScriber fromInternet documents.

This cooperation among processesoften results in dependencies such that a certain processcannot proceed until other processes finish some tasks.Despite the popularity of using cooperating processes inapplication design, operating systems typically ignore processdependencies and schedule processes independently. This canresult in poor system performance due to the actual schedulingbehavior contradicting the desired scheduling policy.To address this problem, we have developed SWAP, a system thatautomatically detects process dependencies and accounts forsuch dependencies in scheduling. SWAP uses system callhistory to determine possible resource dependencies amongprocesses in an automatic and fully transparent fashion.Because some dependencies cannot be precisely determined, SWAPassociates confidence levels with dependency information thatare dynamically adjusted using feedback from process blockingbehavior. SWAP can schedule processes using this imprecisedependency information in a manner that is compatible withexisting scheduling mechanisms and ensures that actualscheduling behavior corresponds to the desired schedulingpolicy in the presence of process dependencies. We haveimplemented SWAP in Linux and measured its effectiveness onmicrobenchmarks and real applications. Our experiment resultsshow that SWAP has low overhead and can provide substantialimprovements in system performance in scheduling processeswith dependencies.

These applications suffer fromthe limitations of current main-memory XQuery processors whichbreak for rather small documents. In this paper we proposetechniques, based on a notion of projection for XML, which canbe used to drastically reduce memory requirements in XQueryprocessors. The main contribution of the paper is a staticanalysis technique that can identify at compile time whichparts of the input document are needed to answer an arbitraryXQuery. We present a loading algorithm that takes theresulting information to build a projected document, which issmaller than the original document, and on which the queryyields the same result. We implemented projection in theGalax XQuery processor. Our experiments show that projectionreduces memory requirements by a factor of 20 on average, andis effective for a wide variety of queries. In addition,projection results in some speedup during query evaluation.

Key element in our approach is theuse of targeted parts of the electronic patient record toserve as a readily available user model for thepersonalization task. We discuss several enhancements to aTF*IDF based approach for measuring the similarity betweenarticles and the patient record. We also present the resultsof an experiment involving almost 3,000 relevance judgments bymedical doctors. Our evaluation establishes that the automatedsystem surpasses in performance alternative methods forpersonalizing the set of articles, including keyword-basedqueries manually constructed by medical experts for thispurpose.

Nayar                    2003-03-14                    Pushbroom cameras produce one-dimensional imagesof a scene with high resolution at a high frame-rate. As aresult, they provide superior data compared to conventionaltwo-dimensional cameras in cases where the scene of interestcan be temporally scanned. In this paper, we consider theproblem of recovering the structure of a scene using a set ofpushbroom cameras. Although pushbroom cameras have been usedto recover scene structure in the past, the algorithms forrecovery were developed separately for different cameramotions such as translation and rotation. In this paper, wepresent a general framework of structure recovery forpushbroom cameras with 6 degree-of-freedom motion. We analyzethe translation and rotation cases using our framework anddemonstrate that several previous results are really specialcases of our result. Using this framework, we also show thatthree or more pushbroom cameras can be used to compute scenestructure as well as motion of translation or rotation. Weconclude with a set of experiments that demonstrate the use ofpushbroom imaging to recover structure from unknown motion.

Because of the distributed nature of networks, large-scale information systems are highly vulnerable to negative elements such as intruders and attackers. The types of attack on a system can be diverse and from different sources. Some of the factors contributing to creating an insecure system are the relentless pace of technology, the need for information processing, and the heterogeneity of hardware and software. In addition to these insecurities, the growth and success of e-commerce make networks a desirable target for intruders to steal credit card numbers, bank account balances, and other valuable information. This paper looks at two different security technologies, SNMP v3 and MarketNet, their architectures and how they have been developed to protect network resources and services, such as, internet applications, devices, and other services, against attacks.

Kaiser,  Gaura                    2002-12-02                    Although they often provide critical services, most workflow systems are not dependable. There has been much literature on dependable/survivable distributed systems; most is concerned with developing new architectures, not adapting pre-existing ones. Additionally, the literature is focused on hardening, security-based defense, as opposed to recovery. For deployed systems, it is often infeasible to completely replace existing infrastructures; what is more pragmatic are ways in which existing distributed systems can be adapted to offer better dependability. In this paper, we outline a general architecture that can easily be retrofitted to legacy workflow systems in order to improve dependability and fault tolerance. We do this by monitoring enactment and replicating partial workflow states as tools for detection, analysis and recovery. We discuss some policies that can guide these mechanisms. Finally, we describe and evaluate our implementation, Survivor, which modified an existing workflow system provided by the Naval Research Lab.

Kc,  Stephen A. Edwards,  Gail E                    2002-11-19                    Ensuring the security and integrity of computer systems deployed on the Internet is growing harder. This is especially true in the case of server systems based on open source projects like Linux, Apache, Sendmail, etc. since it is easier for a hacker to get access to the binary format of deployed applications if the source code to the software is publicly accessible. Often, having a binary copy of an application program is enough to help locate security vulnerabilities in the program. In the case of legacy systems where the source code is not available, advanced reverse-engineering and decompilation techniques can be used to construct attacks.This paper focuses on measures that reduce the effectiveness of hackers at conducting large-scale, distributed attacks. The first line of defense involves additional runtime checks that are able to counteract the majority of hacking attacks. Introducing diversity in deployed systems to severely diminish the probability of propagation to other systems helps to prevent effective attacks like the DDOS attack against the DNS root servers in October 21, 2002.

This can range from pop-up ads to flashy banners to unnecessary images and links scattered around the screen. Extraction of \"useful and relevant\" content from web pages, has many applications ranging from lightweight environments, like cell phone and PDA browsing, to speech rendering for the visually impaired, to text summarization Most approaches to removing the clutter or making the content more readable involves either changing the size of the font or simply removing certain HTML-denoted components like images, thus taking away from the webpage's inherent look and feel. Unlike Content Reformatting, which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses Content Extraction. We have developed a framework that employs an easily extensible set of techniques that incorporate advantages of previous work on content extraction while limiting the disadvantages. Our key insight is to work with the Document Object Model tree (after parsing and correcting the HTML), rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly available Web proxy that anyone can use to extract content from HTML web pages for their own purposes.

Furthermore, packet switches that provide Quality of Service (QoS), such as bandwidth and delay guarantees, to the served user traffic are also highly desired. This report addresses the issue of constructing a high-capacity QoS-capable, multi-module switching node.Output queued switches provide the best performance in terms of throughput as well as QoS but do not scale. Input queued switches, on the other hand, require complex arbitration procedures to achieve the same level of performance. We enumerate the design constraints in the construction of a packet switch and present several approaches to build a system composed of lower-capacity memory and space elements, and analyze their performance. Towards this goal, we establish a new taxonomy for a class of switches, which we call Buffered Clos switches, and present a formal framework for optimal packet switching performance, in terms of both throughput and QoS.Within the taxonomy, we augment the existing combined input-output queueing (CIOQ) systems with Aggregation and Pipelining techniques. Furthermore, we present the design and analysis of a novel parallel packet switch architecture. For the items in the taxonomy, we present algorithms that provide optimal throughput and QoS, in accordance with the above performance framework. While some of the presented ideas are still in the investigative stage, we believe that the current state of the work, especially the formal treatment of switching, will be beneficial to the ongoing research in the field.

Werschulz                    2002-10-16                    \\emph{Computational complexity} has two goals: finding the inherent cost of some problem, and finding optimal algorithms for solving this problem. \\emph{Information-based complexity} (IBC) studies the complexity of problems for which the available information is partial, contaminated by error, and priced. Examples of such problems include integration, approximation, ordinary and partial differential equations, integral equations, and the solution of nonlinear problems such as root-finding and optimization. In this talk, we give a brief overview of IBC. We focus mainly on the integration problem (which is a simple, yet important, problem that can be used to illustrate the main ideas of IBC) and the approximation problem (which will be of most interest to specialists in learning theory). One important issue that we discuss is the ``curse of dimension''---the depressing fact that the worst case complexity of many problems depends exponentially on dimension, rendering them intractable. We explore IBC-based techniques for vanquishing the curse of dimension. In particular, we find that randomization beats intractability for the integration problem but not for the approximation problem; on the other hand, both these problems are tractable in the average case setting under a Wiener sheet measure.

The question addressed here is how to retrofit existing systems with self-healing, adaptation and/or self management capabilities. The problem is obviously intensified for \"systems of systems\" composed of components, whether new or legacy, that may have been developed by different vendors, mixing and matching COTS and \"open source\" components. This system composition model is expected to be increasingly common in high performance computing. The usual approach is to train technicians to understand the complexities of these components and their connections, including performance tuning parameters, so that they can then manually monitor and reconfigure the system as needed. We envision instead attaching a \"standard\" feedback loop infrastructure to existing distributed systems for the purposes of continual monitoring and dynamically adapting their activities and performance. (This approach can also be applied to \"new\" systems, as an alternative to \"building in\" adaptation facilities, but we do not address that here.) Our proposed infrastructure consists of multiple layers with the objectives of probing, measuring and reporting of activity and state within the execution of the legacy system among its components and connectors; gauging, analysis and interpretation of the reported events; and possible feedback to focus the probes and gauges to drill deeper, or when necessary - direct but automatic reconfiguration of the running system.

This feedback-loop infrastructure is primarily targeted to pre-existing systems and thus operates outside the application itself without making assumptions about the target system's internal communication/computation mechanisms, implementation language/framework, availability of source code, etc. This paper assumes the existence of the monitoring and analysis components, presented elsewhere, and focuses on the mechanisms used to control and coordinate possibly complex repairs/reconfigurations to the target system. These mechanisms require lower-level actuators or effectors somehow attached to the target system, so we briefly sketch one such facility (elaborated elsewhere). The core of the paper is the model, architecture, and implementation of Workflakes, the decentralized process engine we use to tailor, control, coordinate, respond to contingencies, etc. regarding a cohort of such actuators. We have validated our approach and the Workflakes prototype in several case studies, related to different application domains. Due to space restrictions we concentrate primarily on one case study, elaborate with some details a second, and only sketch others.

This top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. For example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. A user who queries such a relation might simply specify the user's location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. Processing such top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. One critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. In this paper, we study how to process top-k queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. We present several new algorithms for processing such queries, and adapt existing techniques to our scenario as well. We also study the execution time of our algorithms analytically and present experimental results using both synthetic and real web-accessible data.

(This approach could also be applied to \"new\" systems, as an alternative to \"building in\" adaptation facilities, but we do not address that here.) Our infrastructure consists of multiple layers with the objectives of 1. probing, measuring and reporting of activity and state during the execution of the target system among its components and connectors; 2. gauging, analysis and interpretation of the reported events; and 3. whenever necessary, feedback onto the probes and gauges, to focus them (e.g., drill deeper), or onto the running target system, to direct its automatic adjustment and reconfiguration. We report on our successful experience using this approach in dynamic adaptation of a large-scale commercial application that requires both coarse and fine grained modifications.

A query on these attributes will typically request not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, which indicates how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). Furthermore, unlike in the relational model, users may just want the k top-ranked objects for their selection queries, for a relatively small k. In addition to the differences in the query model, another peculiarity of multimedia repositories is that they may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. In this paper, we investigate how to optimize the processing of top-k selection queries over multimedia repositories. The access characteristics of the repositories and the above query model lead to novel issues in query optimization. In particular, the choice of the indexes used to search the repository strongly influences the cost of processing the filtering condition. We define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. Although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is NP-hard, we present an efficient algorithm that solves the problem optimally when the predicates in the query are independent. We also show that the problem of optimizing top-k selection queries can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating more traditional selection conditions. Thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem to which techniques of query processing and optimization may be adapted.

To provide fault tolerant, and enhance scalability, availability and performance, service registries often need to be replicated. In this paper, we present Swift (Selective anti-entropy WIth FasT update propagation), a flexible and efficient protocol for multi-scope service registry replication. As consistency is a less of concern compared with availability in service registry replication, we choose to build Swift on top of anti-entropy to support high availability replication. Swift makes two contributions as follows. First, it defines a more general and flexible form of anti-entropy called selective anti-entropy, which extends the applicability of anti-entropy from full replication to partial replication by selectively reconciling inconsistent states between two replicas, and improves anti-entropy efficiency by fine controlling update propagation within each subset. Selective anti-entropy is the first that we are aware of in using anti-entropy to support generic partial replication. Secondly, Swift integrates service registry overlay networks with selective anti-entropy. Different topologies, such as full mesh and spanning tree, can be used for constructing service registry overlay networks. These overlay networks are used to propagate new updates quickly so as to minimize inconsistency among replicas. We have implemented Swift for replicating multi-scope Directory Agents in the Service Location Protocol. Our experience shows that Swift is flexible, efficient, and lightweight.

Elastic quotas allow all users to use unlimited amounts of available disk space while still providing system administrators the ability to control how the disk space is allocated among users. Elastic quotas maintain existing persistent file semantics while supporting user-controlled policies for removing files when the file system becomes too full. We have implemented an elastic quota system in Solaris and measured its performance. The system is simple to implement, requires no kernel modifications, and is compatible with existing disk space management methods. Our results show that elastic quotas are an effective, low-overhead solution for flexible file system management.

Ipeirotis, Luis Gravano                    2002-06-19                    Many valuable text databases on the web have non-crawlable contents that are \"hidden\" behind search interfaces. Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over many such databases at once through a unified query interface. A critical task for a metasearcher to process a query e??ciently and eRectively is the selection of the most promising databases for the query, a task that typically relies on statistical summaries of the database contents. Unfortunately, web accessible text databases do not generally export content summaries. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive content summaries from \"uncooperative\" databases by using \"focused query probes,\" which adaptively zoom in on and extract documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the databases. Our content summaries are the first to include absolute document frequency estimates for the database words. We also present a novel database selection algorithm that exploits both the extracted content summaries and a hierarchical classification of the databases, automatically derived during probing, to compensate for potentially incomplete content summaries. Finally, we evaluate our techniques thoroughly using a variety of databases, including 50 real web-accessible text databases. Our experiments indicate that our new content-summary construction technique is effcient and produces more accurate summaries than those from previously proposed strategies. Also, our hierarchical database selection algorithm exhibits significantly higher precision than its flat counterparts.

Keromytis, Jonathan M. Smith                    2002-05-16                    Maximizing local autonomy has led to a scalable Internet. Scalability and the capacity for distributed control have unfortunately not extended well to resource access control policies and mechanisms. Yet management of security is becoming an increasingly challenging problem, in no small part due to scaling up of measures such as number of users, protocols, applications, network elements, topological constraints, and functionality expectations.In this paper we discuss scalability challenges for traditional access control mechanisms and present a set of fundamental requirements for authorization services in large scale networks. We show why existing mechanisms fail to meet these requirements, and investigate the current design options for a scalable access control architecture.We argue that the key design options to achieve scalability are the choice of the representation of access control policy, the distribution mechanism for policy and the choice of access rights revocation scheme.

In addition to potentially improving a system's overall accuracy, density estimation converts similarity scores to probabilities. These probabilities provide confidence measures for a system's predictions which are easily interpretable and could potentially help to combine results of various systems. We discuss the results of three complete experiments on three separate data sets applying density estimation to the results of a TF*IDF/Rocchio system, and we compare these results to those of many competing approaches.

It interworks with the traditional telephone networks via a PSTN/IP gateway. It also serves as a corporate or campus infrastructure for existing and future services like web, email, video and streaming media. Initially intended for a few users, it will eventually replace the plain old telephones from our offices, due to the cost benefit and new services it offers. We also discuss common inter-operability problems between the PBX and the gateway. This paper is intended as a design document of the overall system.

The overlay network structure includes special purpose nodes which affect the routes taken through the overlay. Two main factors are considered: the routing algorithm utilized for the overlay and the method for selecting the special purpose nodes. The routing algorithms considered are based on methods originally defined for peer-to-peer services. A model was developed for the overlay network which allowed altering the routing algorithm, method for selection of special purpose nodes and the underlying ISP structure. The model was used to assess the impact of specific routing algorithms and selection methods on latency and path length. The implications of utilizing a specific method for node selection on the probability of a successful DDoS attack is briefly discussed.

However, inside each service flows can be treated unfairly, since the DS model has no policy to distribute the service bandwidth between all sessions that compose the service aggregate traffic. Our goal is to study a signaling protocol that fairly distributes the resources reserved for each DS service between scalable multimedia sessions in a multicast network environment, where scalable sources divide session traffic in hierarchical layers, sending each layer to different multicast groups. We present a signaling protocol called Session-Aware Popularity Resource Allocation (SAPRA) that allows the distribution of DS services resources along sessions path, based upon the receiver population of each session. Simulations show that SAPRA protocol has small bandwidth overhead, is efficient updating the resources allocated to each session and also supplying receivers with reports about the quality level of their session.

This data is often best exploited in structured or relational form, which is suited for sophisticated query processing, for integration with relational databases, and for data mining. Current information extraction techniques extract relations from a text database by examining every document in the database. This exhaustive approach is not practical, or sometimes even feasible, for large databases. In this paper, we develop an efficient query-based technique to identify documents that are potentially useful for the extraction of a target relation. We start by sampling the database to characterize the documents from which an information extraction system manages to extract relevant tuples. Then, we apply machine learning and information retrieval techniques to derive queries likely to match additional useful documents in the database. Finally, we issue these queries to the database to retrieve documents from which the information extraction system can extract the final relation. Our technique requires that databases support only a minimal boolean query interface, and is independent of the choice of the underlying information extraction system. We report a thorough experimental evaluation over more than one million documents that shows that we significantly improve the efficiency of the extraction process by focusing only on promising documents. Our proposed technique could be used to query a standard web search engine, hence providing a building block for efficient information extraction over the web at large.

This paper concentrates on how we coordinate and actuate the potentially multi-part adaptation, operating externally to the target systems, that is, without requiring any a priori built-in adaptation facilities on the part of said target systems. The actual changes are performed on the fly onto the target by communities of mobile software agents, coordinated by a decentralized process engine. These changes can be coarse-grained, such as replacing entire components or rearranging the connections among components, or fine-grained, such as changing the operational parameters, internal state and functioning logic of individual components. We discuss our successful experience using our approach in dynamic adaptation of a large-scale commercial application, which requires both coarse and fine grained modifications.

Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural (parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships, and twig matching is achieved by: (i)~using structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against the XML database, and (ii)~stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach for matching twig patterns is that intermediate result sizes can get large, even when the input and output sizes are more manageable.In this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack, for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked stacks to compactly represent partial results to root-to-leaf query paths, which are then composed to obtain matches for the twig pattern. When the twig pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships between elements, TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential algorithms that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of sizes of the input lists and the final result list, but independent of the sizes of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a modification of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig patterns in sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis with experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data, and query twig patterns.

Peers can be either mobile or stationary. We focus on three different facets of cooperation, namely, data sharing, message relaying and network connection sharing. 7DS enables wireless devices to discover, disseminate, relay information among each other to increase the data access. We evaluate via extensive simulations the effectiveness of our system for data dissemination and message relaying among mobile devices with a large number of user mobility scenarios. We model several general data dissemination approaches and investigate the effect of the wireless coverage range, 7DS host density, and cooperation strategy among the mobile hosts as a function of time. We also present a power conservation mechanism that is beneficial, since it increases the power savings, without degrading the data dissemination. Using theory from random walks, random environments and diffusion of controlled processes, we model one of these data dissemination schemes and show that the analysis confirms the simulation results for this scheme.

Whereas in theory SCTP is supposed to achieve a much better performance than TCP and UDP, at present there are no ex-perimental results showing SCTP s real benefits. This paper analyzes SCTP s strengths and weaknesses and provides simulation results. We implemented SIP on top of UDP, TCP and SCTP in the network simulator and compared the three transport protocols under different network conditions.

Such computation units can be either a single process, or a group of processes of an application, or an entire host. VNAT virtualizes network connections perceived by transport protocols so that identification of network connections is decoupled from stationary hosts. Such virtual connections are then remapped into physical connections to be carried on the physical network using network address translation. VNAT requires no modification to existing applications, operating systems, or protocol stacks. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with the existing communication infrastructure; virtual and normal connections can coexist without interfering each other. VNAT functions entirely within end systems and requires no third party proxies. We have implemented a VNAT prototype with the Linux 2.4 kernel and demonstrated its functionality on a wide range of popular real-world network applications. Our performance results show that VNAT has essentially no overhead except when connections are migrated, in which case the overhead of our Linux prototype is less than 7 percent.

Ipeirotis, Tom Barry, Luis Gravano                    2002-02-01                    SDARTS is a protocol and toolkit designed to facilitate metasearching. SDARTS combines two complementary existing protocols, SDLIP and STARTS, to define a uniform interface that collections should support for searching and exporting metasearch-related metadata. SDARTS also includes a toolkit with wrappers that are easily customized to make both local and remote document collections SDARTS-compliant. This paper describes two significant ways in which we have extended the SDARTS toolkit. First, we have added a tool that automatically builds rich content summaries for remote web collections by probing the collections with appropriate queries. These content summaries can then be used by a metasearcher to select over which collections to evaluate a given query. Second, we have enhanced the SDARTS toolkit so that all SDARTS-compliant collections export their metadata under the emerging Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol. Conversely, the SDARTS toolkit now also allows all OAI-compliant collections to be made SDARTS-compliant with minimal effort. As a result, we implemented a bridge between SDARTS and OAI, which will facilitate easy interoperability among a potentially large number of collections. The SDARTS toolkit, with all related documentation and source code, is publicly available at http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu.

However, it is now facing significant challenges as clock rates reach several GigaHertz, chip sizes increase, and the demand for low power and modular design become paramount. An alternative paradigm is clockless or asynchronous design, which has several potential advantages towards meeting these challenges.This thesis focuses on the design of very high-speed asynchronous systems. A more specific focus of this thesis is on high-throughput asynchronous pipelines, since pipelining is at the heart of most high-performance systems.This thesis contributes four new asynchronous pipeline styles: \"lookahead,\" \"high-capacity,\" \"MOUSETRAP\" and \"dynamic GasP\" pipelines. The styles differ from each other in many aspects, such as protocols, storage capacity, implementation style, and timing assumptions. The new styles are capable of multi-GigaHertz throughputs in today's silicon technology (e.g., 0.13-0.18 micron), yet each style has a simple implementation. High throughputs are obtained through efficient pipelining of systems at a fine granularity, though the pipeline styles are also useful for coarser-grain applications.The basic pipeline styles are extended to address several issues that arise in practice while designing real-world systems. In particular, the styles are generalized to handle a greater variety of architectures (e.g., datapaths with forks and joins), and to robustly interface with arbitrary-speed environments.Finally, the approaches of this thesis are validated by designing and fabricating real VLSI subsystems, including: simple FIFO's, pipelined adders, and an experimental digital FIR filter chip. All chips were tested to be fully functional; throughputs of over 2.4 GHz for the FIFO's, and up to 1.3 GHz for the FIR filter, were obtained in an IBM 0.18 micron technology.

In particular, the memo explores issues of error resiliency and recovery. In particular, the paper considers two questions. First, given N consecutive frame erasures (due to packet losses), how long does the decoder take to resynchronize its state with the encoder? What is the strength of the resulting error signal, both in terms of objective and subjective measures? The second issue explores which particular factors contribute to the strength of the error signal: the distortion of the speech due to the incorrect concealment of the erasures, or the subsequent distortion due to the loss of state synchronization, even though correct packets are being received. Both objective and subjective measures are used to characterize the importance of each of these two factors.

Arthur G. Werschulz                    2001-12-19                    We study the complexity of Fredholm problems $(I-T_k)u=f$ of the second kind on the $I^d=[0,1]^d$. Previous work on the complexity of this problem has assumed either that we had complete information about the kernel~$k$ or that the kernel~$k$ and the right-hand side~$f$ had the same smoothness; moreover, this information is usually exact. In this paper, we suppose that $f\\in W^{r,p}(I^d)$ and $k\\in W^{s,p}(I^d)$. We also assume that $\\delta$-noisy standard information is available. We find that the $n$th minimal error is $\\Theta(n^{-\\mu}+\\delta)$, where $\\mu = \\min\\{r/d, s/(2d)\\}$, and that a noisy modified finite element method (MFEM) has nearly minimal error. This noisy modified FEM can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using these results, we find tight bounds on the $\\varepsilon$-complexity for this problem, said bounds depending on the cost~$c(\\delta)$ of calculating a $\\delta$-noisy information value. As an example, if the cost of a $\\delta$-noisy evaluation is proportional to $\\delta^{-t}$, then the $\\varepsilon$-complexity is roughly $(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/\\mu+t}$.

Werschulz, Henryk Wozniakowski                    2001-12-19                    The approximation and integration problems consist of finding an approximation to a function~$f$ or its integral over some fixed domain~$\\Sigma$. For the classical version of these problems, we have partial information about the functions~$f$ and complete information about the domain~$\\Sigma$; for example, $\\Sigma$ might be a cube or ball in~$\\mathbb R^d$. When this holds, it is generally the case that integration is not harder than approximation; moreover, integration can be much easier than approximation. What happens if we have partial information about~$\\Sigma$? This paper studies the surface approximation and surface integration problems, in which $\\Sigma=\\Sigma_g$ for functions~$g$. More specifically, our functions~$f$ are $r$~times continuously differentiable scalar functions of $l$~variables, and $g$ are $s$~times continuously differentiable injective functions of~$d$ variables with $l$~components. Error for the surface approximation problem is measured in the $L_q$-sense. Our problems are well-defined, provided that $d\\le l$, $r\\ge 0$, and $s\\ge 1$. Information consists of function evaluations of~$f$ and~$g$. We show that the $\\varepsilon$-complexity of surface approximation is proportional to $(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/\\mu}$ with $\\mu=\\mrs/d$. We also show that if $s\\ge 2$, then the $\\varepsilon$-complexity of surface integration is proportional to $(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/\\nu}$ with $$\\nu=\\min\\left\\{ \\frac{r}{d},\\frac{s-\\delta_{s,1}(1-\\delta_{d,l})}{\\min\\{d,l-1\\}}\\right\\}.$$ (This bound holds as well for several subcases of $s=1$; we conjecture that it holds for all $r\\ge0$, $s\\ge1$, and $d\\le l$.) Using these results, we determine when surface approximation is easier than, as easy as, or harder than, surface integration; all three possibilities can happen. In particular, we find that if $s=1$ and $d<l$, then $\\mu=1/d$ and $\\nu=0$, so that surface integration is unsolvable and surface approximation is solvable; this is an extreme case for which surface approximation is easier than surface integration.

Ipeirotis, Luis Gravano                    2001-12-08                    Many valuable text databases on the web have non-crawlable contents that are ``hidden'' behind search interfaces. Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over many such databases at once through a unified query interface. A critical task for a metasearcher to process a query efficiently and effectively is the selection of the most promising databases for the query, a task that typically relies on statistical summaries of the database contents. Unfortunately, web-accessible text databases do not generally export content summaries. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive content summaries from ``uncooperative'' databases by using ``focused query probes,'' which adaptively zoom in on and extract documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the databases. The content summaries that result from this algorithm are efficient to derive and more accurate than those from previously proposed probing techniques for content-summary extraction. We also present a novel database selection algorithm that exploits both the extracted content summaries and a hierarchical classification of the databases, automatically derived during probing, to produce accurate results even for imperfect content summaries. Finally, we evaluate our techniques thoroughly using a variety of databases, including 50 real web-accessible text databases.

This paper surveys a variety of techniques for translating these concurrent specifications into sequential code. The techniques address compiling a wide variety of languages, ranging from dataflow to Petri nets. Each uses a different technique, to some degree chosen to match the semantics of concurrent language. Each technique is considered to consist of a partial evaluator operating on an interpreter. This combination provides a clearer picture of how parts of each technique could be used in a different setting.

A very successful means of inferring the function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose functions are already known. Currently, one of the most powerful such homology detection methods is the SVM-Fisher method of Jaakkola, Diekhans and Haussler (ISMB 2000). This method combines a generative, profile hidden Markov model (HMM) with a discriminative classification algorithm known as a support vector machine (SVM). The current work presents an alternative method for SVM-based protein classification. The method, SVM-pairwise, uses a pairwise sequence similarity algorithm such as Smith-Waterman in place of the HMM in the SVM-Fisher method. The resulting algorithm, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better remote protein homology detection than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs and PSI-BLAST.

Gross, Suhit Gupta, Gail E. Kaiser, Gaurav S. Kc, Janak J. Parekh                    2001-10-02                    We present an interaction model enabling data-source probes and action-based gauges to communicate using an intelligent event model known as ActEvents. ActEvents build on conventional event concepts by associating structural and semantic information with raw data, thereby allowing recipients to be able to dynamically understand the content of new kinds of events. Two submodels of ActEvents are proposed: SmartEvents, which are XML-structured events containing references to their syntactic and semantic models, and Gaugents, which are heavier but more flexible intelligent mobile software agents. This model is presented in light of DARPA's DASADA program, where ActEvents are used in a larger-scale subsystem, called KX, which supports continual validation of distributed, component-based systems. ActEvents are emitted by probes in this architecture, and propagated to gauges, where \"measurements\" of the raw data associated with probes are made, thereby continually determining updated target-system properties. ActEvents are also proposed as solutions for a number of other applications, including a distributed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) known as CHIME.

Ipeirotis, Luis Gravano, Mehran Sahami                    2001-08-18                    The contents of many valuable web-accessible databases are only available through search interfaces and are hence invisible to traditional web ``crawlers.'' Recently, commercial web sites have started to manually organize web-accessible databases into Yahoo!-like hierarchical classification schemes. Here, we introduce QProber, a modular system that automates this classification process by using a small number of query probes, generated by document classifiers. QProber can use a variety of types of classifiers to generate the probes. To classify a database, QProber does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of QProber over collections of real documents, experimenting with different types of document classifiers and retrieval models. We have also tested our system with over one hundred web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases.

The motivation of the MLUM model is to accomplish intra-session and inter-session fairness in the presence of multi-rate (multi-layer) multimedia sessions, distributing bandwidth between multicast trees of different sessions, considering the number of receivers in each session, and improving bandwidth efficiency. To accomplish this goal, the model is divided in three components: a fairness definition,a policy and a protocol. The MLUM definition guarantees fairness between receivers in a session and fairness between different sessions, considering the number of receivers in each session. The MLUM policy implements the MLUM definition in multicast aware border routers of Autonomous Systems (AS). It's functionality is divided in the control plane and the data plane. In the control plane, sessions fair rates are estimated based upon the MLUM fairness definition. In the data plane, a queueing discipline will fairly distribute bandwidth between sessions, considering their fair rates. The MLUM protocol allows the exchange of control information (sessions number of receivers and fair rates) between MLUM policy routers in order to accomplish a fair distribution of bandwidth between concurrent sessions. This paper aim to present the MLUM fairness definition, to describe the MLUM fairness policy control and data plane functionality and to evaluate how the policy data plane can fairly distribute bandwidth. We present some simulations that evaluate the performance of the MLUM policy data plane in different scenarios and that compare its performance to other queueing disciplines. We also briefly describe the MLUM protocol, due to its close relation with of the MLUM policy functionality.

Because the degree of burstiness depends on the packet interval, we first derive a formula to re-compute the conditional loss probability of a Gilbert loss model when the packet interval changes. We find that FEC works better at a larger packet interval under bursty losses. In our MOS-based (Mean Opinion Score) listening tests, we did not find a consistent trend in MOS when burstiness increases if FEC is not used. That is, In some occasions MOS can be higher with a higher burstiness. With FEC, our results confirms the analytical results that quality is better with a larger packet interval, but $T$ should not be too large to avoid severe penalty on a single packet loss. We also find that low bit-rate redundancy generally produces lower perceived quality than FEC, if the main codec is already a low bit-rate codec. Finally, we compare our MOS results with objective quality estimation algorithms (PESQ, PSQM/PSQM+, MNB and EMBSD). We find PESQ has the best linear correlation with MOS, but the value is still less than commonly cited, implying they cannot be used in isolation to predict MOS.

An earlyversion of the JAM system was described inStolfo-et-al-97-KDD-JAM. Since then, JAM has evolved botharchitecturally and functionally and here we present the final designand implementation details of this system architecture. JAM is anextensible agent-based distributed data mining system that supportsthe remote dispatch and exchange of agents among participating datasites and employs meta-learning techniques to combine the multiplemodels that are learned. One of JAM's target applications is fraud andintrusion detection in financial information systems. A briefdescription of this learning task and JAM's applicability and summaryresults are also discussed.

Peers can be either mobile or stationary. 7DS is anarchitecture, a set of protocols and an implementation enabling theexchange of data among peers that are not necessarily connected to theInternet. It runs as an application complementary to other dataaccess approaches (such as via base stations or info-stations). Itanticipates the information needs of users and fulfills them bysearching for information among peers. We evaluate via extensivesimulations the effectiveness of our system in data dissemination formobile devices. We model several general data disseminationapproaches and investigate the effect of the wireless coverage range,network size, query mechanism, cooperation strategy among the mobilehosts and power conservation with a large number of user mobilityscenarios. Using theory from random walks and random environments anddiffusion of controlled processes, we model one of these datadissemination schemes and show that the analysis confirms thesimulation results for this scheme.

Nayar                    2001-02-07                    Conventional vision systems and algorithms assume the camera to have a single viewpoint. However, sensors need not always maintain a single viewpoint. For instance, an incorrectly aligned system could cause non-single viewpoints. Also, systems could be designed to specifically deviate from a single viewpoint to trade-off image characteristics such as resolution and field of view. In these cases, a locus of viewpoints is formed, called a caustic. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the viewpoint loci for catadioptric cameras with conic reflectors. Properties of these viewpoint loci with regard to field of view, resolution and other geometric properties are presented. In addition, we present a simple technique to calibrate such non-single viewpoint catadioptric cameras and estimate their viewpoint loci (caustics) from known camera motion.

We use supervised machine learning on this compositefeature set to derive discourse structure on the topic level.

We introduce a novel method forsynthesizing this topical structure. The system uses corpus examplesand recursively merges their topics to build a hierarchical tree.

We choose the term tweaking to refer to modifications in structure and behavior that can be made to individual components, as well as sets thereof, or the overall target system configuration, such as adding, removing or substituting components, while the system is running and without bringing it down. The goal of software tweaking is manifold: supporting run-time software composition, enforcing adherence to requirements, ensuring uptime and quality of service of mission-critical systems, recovering from and preventing faults, seamless system upgrading, etc. Our approach involves dispatching and coordinating software agents - named Worklets - via a process engine, since successful tweaking of a complex distributed software system often requires the concerted action of multiple agents on multiple components. The software tweaking process must incorporate and decide upon knowledge about the specifications and architecture of the target software, as well as Worklets capabilities. Software tweaking is correlated to a variety of other software processes - such as configuration management, deployment, validation and evolution - and allows to address at run time a number of related concerns that are normally dealt with only at development time.

A. G. Werschulz, H. Wozniakowski                    2000-12-21                    We study the worst case complexity of computing $\\varepsilon$-approximations of volumes of $d$-dimensional regions~$g([0,1]^d)$, by sampling the function~$g$. Here, $g$ is an $s$ times continuously differentiable injection from~$[0,1]^d$ to~$\\reals^d$, where we assume that $s\\ge1$. Since the problem can be solved exactly when $d=1$, we concentrate our attention on the case $d\\ge 2$. This problem is a special case of the surface integration problem we studied previously. Let $\\cc$ be the cost of one function evaluation. The results of our previous work might suggest that the $\\varepsilon$-complexity of volume calculation should be proportional to $\\cc(1/\\varepsilon)^{d/s}$ when $s\\ge 2$. However, using integration by parts to reduce the dimension, we show that if $s\\ge 2$, then the complexity is proportional to $\\cc(1/\\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/s}$. Next, we consider the case $s=1$, which is the minimal smoothness for which the volume problem is well-defined. We show that when $s=1$, an $\\varepsilon$-approximation can be computed with cost proportional to at most $\\cc(1/\\varepsilon)^{(d-1)d/2}$. Since a lower bound proportional to $\\cc(1/\\varepsilon)^{d-1}$ holds when $s=1$, it follows that the complexity in the minimal smoothness case is proportional to $\\cc(1/\\varepsilon)$ when $d=2$, and that there is a gap between the lower and upper bounds when $d\\ge 3$.

Andersen, Ion Badulescu, Jason Nieh                    2000-11-21                    Stackable file systems can provide extensible file system functionality with minimal performance overhead and development cost. However, previous approaches are limited in the functionality they provide. In particular, they do not support size-changing algorithms, which are important and useful for many applications, such as compression and security. We propose fast index files, a technique for efficient support of size-changing algorithms in stackable file systems. Fast index files provide a page mapping between file system layers in a way that can be used with any size-changing algorithm. Index files are designed to be recoverable if lost and add less than 0.1\\% disk space overhead. We have implemented fast indexing using portable stackable templates, and we have used this system to build several example file systems with size-changing algorithms. We demonstrate that fast index files have very low overhead for typical workloads, only 2.3\\% over other stacked file systems. Our system can deliver much better performance on size-changing algorithms than user-level applications, as much as five times faster.

Jae Yang, Naomi Novik                    2000-11-14                    Thin-client computing offers the promise of easier-to-maintain computational services with reduced total cost of ownership. The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes it important to develop techniques for analyzing and comparing their performance, to assess the general feasibility of the thin-client computing model, and to determine the factors that govern the performance of these architectures. To assess the viability of the thin-client computing model, we measured the performance of five popular thin-client platforms running over a wide range of network access bandwidths. Our results show that current thin-client solutions generally work well in a LAN environment, but their performance degrades significantly when they are used in today's broadband environments. We also find that the efficiency of the thin-client protocols varies widely. In some cases, the efficiency of the thin client protocol for web applications is within a factor of two of standard web protocols, while others are 30 times more inefficient. We analyze the differences in the various approaches and explain the impact of the underlying remote display protocols on overall performance.

Traditional RDBMSs do not process these``top-k queries'' efficiently. In our previous work, we outlined afamily of strategies to map a top-k query into a traditional selectionquery that a RDBMS can process efficiently. The goal of such mappingstrategies is to get all needed tuples (but minimize the number ofretrieved tuples) and thus avoid ``restarts'' to get additionaltuples. Unfortunately, no single mapping strategy performedconsistently the best under all data distributions. In this paper, wedevelop a novel mapping technique that leverages information about thedata distribution and adapts itself to the local characteristics ofthe data and the histograms available to do the mapping. We alsoreport the first experimental evaluation of the new and old mappingstrategies over a real RDBMS, namely over Microsoft's SQL Server7.0. The experiments show that our new techniques are robust andsignificantly more efficient than previously known strategiesrequiring at least one sequential scan of the data sets.

Even simple services, such asforwarding voice mail to another user outside the local system, arehard to provide. With the advent of Internet telephony, we need toprovide voice and video mail services. This also offers theopportunity to address some of the shortcomings of existing voice mailsystems. We list general requirements for a multimedia mail system for Internettelephony. We then propose an architecture using SIP (SessionInitiation Protocol) and RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) andcompare various alternative approaches to solving call forwarding,reclaiming and retrieval of messages. We also briefly describe ourprototype implementation.

To address this problem, we have defined and implemented a new protocol family called {\\PFIPOPTION} for the FreeBSD kernel. We have verified the implementation with some of the commonly used IP options. Measurements in kernel and user space showed that BSD socket I/O is the performance bottleneck.

Instead, endusers should apply various end-to-end measurement-based mechanisms to runadmission control. Several other proposals have recommended to reduce thenumber of reservations in the network by using aggregation algorithms, and,thus, reduce the number of signaling messages and states.We study the signaling cost factors, propose several solutions that achievegood performance with reduced processing cost, and evaluate an implementationof a lightweight signaling protocol that incorporates these solutions. First,we identify some the protocol design issues that determine protocol complexityand efficiency, namely the choice of a two-pass vs. one-pass reservationmodel, partial reservation, and the effect of reservation fragmentation. Wealso explore several design options that can speed up reservation setup andquickly recover from reservation fragmentation. Based on the conclusion ofthese studies, we developed a lightweight signaling protocol that can achievegood performance with low processing cost. We also show that with carefulimplementation and by using some of basic hashing techniques to manage flowstates, we can support up to 10,000 flow setups per second (or about 300,000active flows) on a commodity 700 MHz Pentium PC.

Workflow is based on the concept of a process model,describing the process to be followed, and on facilities (collectively termedthe process enactment engine) for supporting and guiding the work ofstakeholders according to that model. Distributed workflow technology nowadaysprovides many of the necessary paradigms, techniques and tools to support themanagement of complex, dynamic and decentralized business practices, theirstakeholders, and their processes. There are a number of dimensions concurringto workflow distribution, which interact - and sometimes conflict - with oneother in various, complex ways, such as distribution of the workflowinformation, the workflow actors, tools employed to carry out the work, and thework itself Complete decentralization of WF along all of its distributiondimensions is still a challenge. On the other hand approaches and techniquesthat have been established for and have become typical of distributed workflowshow great potential towards the coordination of various kinds of distributedsoftware systems, which require the execution of some kind of process: twoimportant domains are the run-time monitoring and control of functional andnon-functional properties of the components of a distributed system, and thedynamically determined cooperation within a group of software agents towardssome common goal. This proposal intends to investigate the characteristics ofthose software coordination problems and how they can be tackled withdistributed workflow models and techniques. We intend to carry out ourinvestigation in the light of a case study directed towards process-awareprovision of multimedia services and information to groups of dispersed userscarrying out teamwork, including the automated workflow-based management of anadvanced architecture for broadcasting and streaming video and audio, on thebasis of available network and system resources. The case study can be alsoseen as a particular example within a more generic distributed system scenario,i.e. the continual validation of generic distributed applications. The scaleof distribution is that of global dispersion of processes, software components,stakeholders, and data. Thus, we are going to experiment with a set oftechniques and mechanisms, which address those aspects at the global networkingscale, and whose integration within a globally decentralized workflowmanagement system will help reconciling the various distributed dimensions ofworkflow, as well as resolving diverse distributed coordination problems.

We describe how an interworking function (IWF) can allow SIP user agents to call H.323 terminals and vice versa. Our solution addresses user registration, call sequence mapping and session description.

It provides a flexible and scalable service discovery framework in IP network, and it can work with or without a directory service. This paper presents mSLP - Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol. mSLP proposes to use a fully meshed peering Directory Agent (DA) architecture. Peer DAs exchange service registration information, and keep the same consistent data for the shared scopes. mSLP provides a reliable directory service for an SLP system. It also greatly simplifies SLP service registration leading to a thin-client Service Agent (SA) implementation. mSLP is backward compatible with SLPv2, and incremental deployment is supported.

Ross, Kazi A. Zaman                    2000-05-02                    Datacubes compute aggregates of a set of database records at a variety of different granularities. For large datasets with many dimensions, the complete datacube may be very large. In order to support on-line access to datacube results, one would like to perform some precomputation to enhance query performance.Existing schemes materialize selected datacube tuples on disk, choosing the most beneficial cuboids (i.e., combinations of dimensions) to materialize given a space limit. However, in the context of a data-warehouse receiving frequent ``append'' updates to the database, the cost of keeping these disk-resident cuboids up-to-date can be high.In this paper, we propose a main memory based framework which provides rapid response to queries and requires considerably less maintenance cost than a disk based scheme in an append-only environment. We materialize in main memory (a) selected coarse-granularity tuples of the datacube, and (b) all tuples at the finest level of granularity of the cube. Our approach is limited to applications in which the finest granularity tuples of the datacube fit in main memory. We argue that there are important applications that meet this requirement. Further, as main memory sizes grow over the coming years, more and more applications will meet this requirement.For a given datacube query, we first look among our coarse-granularity tuples to see if we have a direct answer for the query. If so, that answer is returned directly. If not, we use a hash based scheme reminiscent of partial match retrieval to rapidly compute the answer to the query from the finest-level data without having to scan all of the base tuples. Our in-memory data structures allow for rapid updates in response to the appearance of new base data.We show how to choose which coarse-level tuples to precompute, and how to select partial-match keys to minimize the effects of skew. We present analytical and experimental results demonstrating the benefits of our approach.

Participants in the system obtain data objects from Internet-connected servers, cache them and exchange them with others who are interested in them. The system exploits the fact that there is a high locality of information access within a geographic area. It aims to increase the data availability to participants with lost connectivity to the Internet. We discuss the main components of the system and possible applications. Finally, we present simulation results that show that the ad hoc networks can be very effective in distributing popular information.

The sequencing projects currently underway provide one view of this machinery. A complementary view is provided by data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. Synthesizing the information from these disparate types of data requires the development of improved computational techniques. We demonstrate how to apply a machine learning algorithm called support vector machines to a heterogeneous data set consisting of expression data as well as phylogenetic profiles derived from sequence similarity searches against a collection of complete genomes. The two types of data provide accurate pictures of overlapping subsets of the gene functional categories present in the cell. Combining the expression data and phylogenetic profiles within a single learning algorithm frequently yields superior classification performance compared to using either data set alone. However, the improvement is not uniform across functional classes. For the data sets investigated here, 23-element phylogenetic profiles typically provide more information than 79-element expression vectors. Often, adding expression data to the phylogenetic profiles introduces more noise than information. Thus, these two types of data should only be combined when there is evidence that the functional classification of interest is clearly reflected in both data sets.

Ross                    2000-04-19                    As random access memory gets cheaper, it becomes increasingly affordable to build computers with large main memories. In this paper, we consider processing queries within the context of a main memory database system and try to enhance the query execution engine of such a system.An execution plan is usually represented as an operator tree. Traditional query execution engines evaluate a query by recursively iterating each operator and returning exactly one tuple result for each iteration. This generates a large number of function calls. In a main-memory database system, the cost of a function call is relatively high.We propose a new evaluation method called power-pipelining. Each operator processes and passes many tuples instead of one tuple each time. We keep the number of matches generated in a join in a local counter array. We reconstitute the run-length encoding of the join result (broken down by input tables) at the end of the join processing or when necessary. We describe an overflow handling mechanism that allows us to always evaluate a query without using too much space. Besides the benefit of reducing the number of function calls, power-pipelining compresses the join result automatically and thus can reduce the transmission cost.However, power-pipelining may not always outperform the traditional pipelining method when the join selectivity is low. To get the benefit of both techniques, we propose to use them together in an execution engine and let the optimizer choose the preferred execution. We discuss how to incorporate this in a cost-based query optimizer.We implemented power-pipelining and the reconstitution algorithm in the Columbia main memory database system. We present a performance study of power-pipelining and the traditional pipelining method. We show that the improvement of using power-pipelining can be very significant. As a result, we believe that power-pipelining is a useful and feasible technique and should be incorporated into main memory database query execution engines.

This data is best exploited if available as a relational table that we could use for answering precise queries or for running data mining tasks. Our Snowball system extracts these relations from document collections starting with only a handful of user-provided example tuples. Based on these tuples, Snowball generates patterns that are used, in turn, to find more tuples. In this paper we introduce a new pattern and tuple generation scheme for Snowball, with different strengths and weaknesses than those of our original system. We also show preliminary results on how we can combinethe two versions of Snowball to extract tuples more accurately.

This paper focuses on the interaction of the component protocols to understand their behavior in network failure and recovery scenarios. We consider a multicast environment based on the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. Analytical models are presented to describe the interplay of all of these protocols in various multicast channel recovery scenarios. Quantitative results for the recovery time of IP multicast channels are given as references for network configurations, and protocol development. Simulation models are developed using the OPNET simulation tool to measure the fault recovery time and the associated protocol control overhead, and study the influence of important protocol parameters. A testbed with five Cisco routers is configured with PIM, OSPF, and IGMP to measure the multicast channel failure and recovery times for a variety of different link and router failures. In general, the failure recovery is found to be light-weight in terms of control overhead and recovery time. Failure recovery time in a WAN is found to be dominated by the unicast protocol recovery process. Failure recovery in a LAN is more complex, and strongly influenced by protocol interactions and implementation specifics. Suggestions for improvement of the failure recovery time via protocol enhancements, parameter tuning, and network configuration are provided.

Search engines typically ignore the contents of such search-only databases. Recently, Yahoo-like directories have started to manually organize these databases into categories that users can browse to find these valuable resources. We propose a novel strategy to automate the classification of search-only text databases. Our technique starts by training a rule-based document classifier, and then uses the classifier's rules to generate probing queries. The queries are sent to the text databases, which are then classified based on the number of matches that they produce for each query. We report some initial exploratory experiments that show that our approach is promising to automatically characterize the contents of text databases accessible on the web.

We identify some important design principles and open issues for Internet QoS.

For instance, web sites containing information on restaurants, theaters, and apartment rentals are relevant primarily to web users in geographical proximity to these locations. In contrast, other information resources are relevant to a broader geographical community. For instance, an on-line newspaper may be relevant to users across the United States. Unfortunately, most current web search engines largely ignore the geographical scope of web resources. In this paper, we introduce techniques for automatically computing the geographical scope of web resources, based on the textual content of the resources, as well as on the geographical distribution of hyperlinks to them. We report an extensive experimental evaluation of our strategies using real web data. Finally, we describe a geographically-aware search engine that we have built using our techniques for determining the geographical scope of web resources.

In this paper, we study the problem of building cost-sensitive intrusion detection models. We examine the major cost factors: development costs, operational costs, damage costs incurred due to intrusions, and the costs involved in responding to intrusions. We propose cost-sensitive machine learning techniques to produce models that are optimized for user-defined cost metrics. We describe an automated approach for generating efficient run-time versions of these models. Empirical experiments in off-line analysis and real-time detection show that our cost-sensitive modeling and deployment techniques are effective in reducing the overall cost of intrusion detection.

Massalin, C. Pu                    2000-01-01                    Typical shared-memory multiprocessor OS kernels use interlocking,implemented as spin-locks or waiting semaphores.  We have implementeda complete multiprocessor OS kernel (including threads, virtualmemory, and I/O including a window system and a file system) usingonly lock-free synchronization methods based on Compare-and-Swap.Lock-free synchronization avoids many serious problems caused bylocks: considerable overhead, concurrency bottlenecks, deadlocks, andpriority inversion in real-time scheduling.  Measured numbers show thelow overhead of our implementation, competitive with user-level threadmanagement systems.

This systemutilizes many data mining methods to build classifiers of network intrusionswhich can be used to test live network stream input in order to detectintrusions. This is done by using Link Analysis and Sequence Analysis methodsto determine statistical attributes of network connections to build a set ofconnection profile records that can be useful in detection. These statisticalattributes have various costs associated with their computation in a liveenvironment. This paper studies the problem of building rule-sets with asensitivity to the cost of computing each attribute. Low-cost attributes wouldbe biased wherever possible, using high-cost attributes only when needed forreliable classification.

Because the Internet is still a best-effort network, the QoSof these applications must be measured and monitored in order toprovide feedbacks to applications for rate and/or error control, andto both end-users and service providers. A standardized objectivemeasurement technology makes it possible to compare between serviceproviders in a fair way. We address the problems of packet delay andloss measurement, since they are the major determining factor ofmultimedia quality. We first describe the problems and techniques inobtaining good measurement results. Then, we discuss the modeling andanalysis of delay and loss. Our goal is to establish feasible metricsthat can reliably predict perceived quality. We find that the extendedGilbert model (2-state being a special case) is a suitable loss model,and the inter-loss distance metric is useful in capturing theburstiness between loss runs. For delay, besides the autocorrelationmetric, a conditional cumulative distribution function may beuseful. We apply these models to some of our Internet packet traces,and find that losses are generally bursty, and that delays usuallyhave a strong temporal dependency component. We also find that thefinal loss pattern after applying playout delay adjustment (and FEC ifused) still corresponds well to the extended Gilbert model.

Hahne, H. Schurlzrinne                    1999-12-06                    Resource reservation needs to accommodate the rapidly growing size andincreasing service diversity of the Internet. Recently, hierarchicalarchitectures have been proposed that provide domain-level reservation.However, it is not clear that these proposals can set up and maintainreservations in an efficient and scalable fashion.In this paper, we describe a distributed architecture and protocol,called the Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP), for inter-domain resource reservation that can scale in terms of messageprocessing load. state storage and bandwidth. Each stub or transitdomain may use its own intra-domain resource reservation protocol. BGRPbuilds a sink tree for each of the stub domains. Each sink treeaggregates bandwidth reservations from all data sources in the network.Since backbone routers only maintain the sink tree information, thetotal number of reservation states at each router scales, in the worstcase, linearly with the number of domains in the Internet.BGRP relies on differentiated services for data forwarding. As aresult, the number of packet classifier entries is small, not the numberof micro-flows.To reduce the protocol message traffic, routers mayreserve domain bandwidth beyond the current load so that sources canjoin or leave the tree or change their reservation without having tosend messages all the way to the root for every such change. We use``soft state'' to maintain reservations. In contrast to RSVP, refreshmessages are delivered reliably, allowing us to reduce the refreshfrequency.

Operating system vendors, however,resist making extensive changes to support stacking, because of theimpact on performance and stability. Existing file system interfacesdiffer from system to system and they support extensibilitypoorly. Consequently, extending file system functionality acrossplatforms is difficult.We propose a new language, FiST, to describe stackable file systems. FiSTuses operations common to file system interfaces. From a singledescription, FiST's compiler produces file system modules for multipleplatforms. The generated code handles many kernel details, freeingdevelopers to concentrate on the main issues of their file systems.This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of FiST. Weextended file system functionality in a portable way without changingexisting kernels. We built several file systems using FiST on Solaris,FreeBSD, and Linux. Our experiences with these examples shows the followingbenefits of FiST: average code size over other stackable file systems isreduced ten times; average development time is reduced seven times;performance overhead of stacking is 1-2\\%.

This data is best exploited ifavailable as a relational table that we could use for answering precise queriesor for running data mining tasks. We explore a technique for extracting suchtables from document collections that requires only a handful of trainingexamples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns,that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the documentcollection. We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowballintroduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples fromplain-text documents. At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowballevaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics forour task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of Snowball andcomparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaperdocuments.

Radev                    1999-10-05                    The abundance of newswire on the World-Wide Webhas resulted in at least four major problems, which seem to presentthe most interesting challenges to users and researchers alike: size,heterogeneity, change, and conflicting information.Size: several hundred newspapers and news agencies maintain their Web siteswith thousands of news stories in each.Heterogeneity: some of the data related to news is in structuredformat (e.g., tables); more exists in semi-structured format (e.g.,Web pages, encyclopedias, textual databases); while the rest of thedata is in textual form (e.g., newswire).Change: most Web sites and certainly all news sources change on a daily basis.Disagreement: different sources present conflicting or at least different viewsof the same event.We have approached the second, third, and fourth of these four problems fromthe point of view of text generation. We have developed a system, {\\scsummons}, which when coupled with appropriate information extractiontechnology, generates a specific genre of natural language summaries of aparticular event (which we call briefings) in a restricted domain. Thebriefings are concise, they contain facts from multiple and heterogeneoussources, and incorporate evolving information, highlighting agreements andcontradictions among sources on the same topic.We have developed novel techniques and algorithms for combining data frommultiple sources at the conceptual level (using natural languageunderstanding), for identifying new information on a given topic; and forpresenting the information in natural language form to the user. We named theframework that we have developed for these problems {\\em language reuse andregeneration} (LRR). Its novelty lies in the ability to produce text bycollating together text already written by humans on the Web.The main features of LRR are: increased robustness through a simplifiedparsing/generation component, leverage on text already written by humans, andfacilities for the inclusion of structured data in computer-generated text.The present thesis contains an introduction to LRR and its use inmulti-document summarization. We have paid special attention to the techniquesfor producing conceptual summaries of multiple sources, to the creation and useof a LRR-based lexicon for text generation, to a methodology used to identifynew and old information in threads of documents, and to the generation offluent natural language text using all the components above.The thesis contains evaluations of the different components of {\\sc summons} aswell as certain aspects of LRR as a methodology. A review of the relevantliterature is included as a separate chapter.

Radev                    1999-10-05                    On-line sources of news typically follow aparticular pattern when presenting updates on a news event overtime. First, they produce a preliminary report on the event, and latersend out updates as the story evolves. There are two classes ofreaders accessing the latter stories - these who have read theoriginal announcement and are familiar with the story background andthose who are ``joining'' the thread at a later point in time. Becauseof the existence of the two clases of readers, news sources typicallyinclude in consequent stories some information that was alreadypresent in earlier stories. We discuss our approach to identifyingsuch repeated pieces of information in news threads and show how thisknowledge can help in generating user-specific summaries of entirethreads of articles.

The choice of programming languages has a huge effect on the algorithms and data structures that are to be implemented in that language. Traditionally, algorithms and data structures have been studied in the context of imperative languages. This workshop considers the algorithmic implications of choosing an advanced functional or logic programming language instead. A total of eight papers were selected for presentation at the workshop, together with an invited lecture by Robert Harper. We would like to thank Dider Remv, general chair of PLT'99, for his assistance in organizing this workshop.

Dossick, Gail E. Kaiser                    1999-09-09                    We introduce CHIME, the Columbia Hypermedia IMmersion Environment, a metadata-based information environment, and describe its potential applications for internet and intranet-based distributed software development. CHIME derives many of its concepts from Multi-User Domains (MUDs), placing users in a semi-automatically generated 3D virtual world representing the software system. Users interact with project artifacts by \"walking around\" the virtual world, where they potentially encounter and collaborate with other users' avatars. CHIME aims to support large software development projects, in which team members are often geographically and temporally dispersed, through novel use of virtual environment technology. We describe the mechanisms through which CHIME worlds are populated with project artifacts, as well as our initial experiments with CHIME and our future goals for the system.

Longer intervals requiring less resourceare favored over shorter intervals requiring more resource. Theoptimal algorithm is shown to respond appropriately to price as amechanism of control whereas the offline greedy and the online FCFSalgorithms do not. The solution uses integer programming, and it isshown that, except in the general case, the problem can be solved inpolynomial time.

Dossick                    1999-07-26                    Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) are groupware systems in whichdata are represented as objects in a virtual world. CVE supportsactivities ranging from software design and development to health caremanagement where user operations are long in duration and intensive inhuman interaction. We found the advanced database transaction modeling andmanagement technologies that have developed in the database community veryuseful in the design and development of CVE. In this paper, we firstpresent a dynamically customizable transaction manager, JPern, thendescribe how a CVE could benefit from integrating with such a transactionmanagement service. Finally, we describe an instance of CVE that wedeveloped, CHIME, and how to integrate JPern with it.

Unlikeother asynchronous synthesis packages, MINIMALIST also offers many options:literal vs. product optimization, single- vs. multi-output logicminimization, using vs. not using fed-back outputs as state variables, andexploring varied code lengths during state assignment, thus allowing thedesigner to explore trade-offs and select the implementation style whichbest suits the application. MINIMALIST benchmark results demonstrate itsability to produce implementations with an average of 34\\% and up to 48\\% lessarea, and an average of 11\\% and up to 37\\% better performance, than the bestexisting package. Our synthesis-for-testability method guarantees 100\\%testability under both stuck-at and robust path delay fault models,requiring little or no overhead. MINIMALIST also features both command-lineand graphic user interfaces, and supports extension via well-definedinterfaces for adding new tools. As such, it is easily augmented to form acomplete path to technology-dependent logic.

Ross, Simon R. Shamoun                    1999-05-24                    This report contains edited transcripts of the discussion held inColumbia's Programming and Problem-Solving course, taught as W4995-01during Spring 1999. The class notes were taken by the teachingassistant so that students could focus on the class material. As aservice to both the students and to others who would like to get someinsight into the class experience, we have drawn all of the classhandouts, discussion, and some of the results into this technicalreport.

Prodromidis, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    1999-05-03                    Inductive learning and classification techniqueshave been applied in many problems in diverse areas. In this paper wedescribe an AI-based approach that combines inductive learningalgorithms and meta-learning methods as a means to compute accurateclassification models for detecting electronic fraud. Inductivelearning algorithms are used to compute detectors of anomalous orerrant behavior over inherently distributed data sets andmeta-learning methods integrate their collective knowledge into higherlevel classification models or ``meta-classifiers''. By supporting theexchange of models or ``classifier agents'' among data sites, ourapproach facilitates the cooperation between financial organizationsand provides unified and cross-institution protection mechanismsagainst fraudulent transactions. Through experiments performed onactual credit card transaction data supplied by two differentfinancial institutions, we evaluate this approach and we demonstrateits utility.

Nayar                    1999-04-29                    We present the idea of a polycamera which is defined as a tightlypacked camera cluster. The cluster is arranged so as to minimize theoverlap between adjecent views. The objective of such clusters is tobe able to image a very large field of view without loss ofresolution. Since these clusters do not have a single viewpoint,analysis is provided on the effects of such non-singularities. We alsopresent certain conbfigurations for polycameras which cover varyingfields of view. We would like to minimizze the number of sensorsrequired to capture a given field of view. Therefore we recommend theuse of wide-angle sensors as opposed to traditional long focal lengthsensors. However, such wide-angle sensors tend to have severedistortions which pull points towards the optical center. This paperalso proposes a method for recovering the distortion parameterswithout the use of any calibration objects. Since distortions causestraight lines in the scene to appear as curves in the image, ouralgorithm seeks to find the distortion parameters that would map theimage curves to straight lines. The user selects a small set of pointsalong the image curves. Recovery of the distortion parameters isformulated as the minimization of an objective function which isdesigned to explicitly account for noise in the selected imagepoints. Experimental results are presented for synthetic data withdifferent noise levels as well as for real images. Once calibrated,the image stream from a wide angle camera can be undistorted in realtime using look up tables. Finally, we apply our distortion correctiontechnique to a polycamera made of four wide-angle cameras to create ahigh resolution 360 degree panorama in real-time.

Nayar                    1999-03-22                    The process of teleoperation can be described as allowing a remote user to control a vehicle by interpretting sensor information captured by the vehicle. One method that is frequently used to implement teleoperation is to provide the user with a real-time video display of a perspective camera mounted on the vehicle. This method limits the remote user to seeing the environment in which is vehicle is present through the fixed viewpoint with which the camera is mounted. Having a fixed viewpoint is extremely limiting and significantly impedes the ability of the remote user to properly navigate. One way to address this problem is to mount the perspective camera on a pan-tilt device. This is rarely done because it is expensive and introduces a significant increase in implementation complexity from both the mechanical and electrical point of view. With the advent of omnidirectional camera technology, there is now a second more attractive alternative. This paper describes the \\rover, a remote controlled vehicle constructed in the summer of 1998 to demonstrate the use of omnidirectional camera technology and a virtual reality display for vehicular teleoperation, audio-video surveillance and forward reconnaissance.

Users share a 3D virtual spaceand manipulate virtual objects representing information to bediscussed. This approach not only allows for cooperation in a sharedphysical space, but also addresses tele-collaboration in physicallyseparate but virtually shared spaces. We refer to EMMIE as a hybriduser interface because it combines a variety of different technologiesand techniques, including virtual elements such as 3D widgets, andphysical objects such as tracked displays and inputdevices. See-through head-worn displays overlay the virtualenvironment on the physical environment. Our research prototypeincludes additional 2D and 3D displays, ranging from palm-sized towall-sized, allowing the most appropriate one to be used for any task.Objects can be moved among displays (including acrossdimensionalities) through drag \\& drop. In analogy to 2D windowmanagers, we describe a prototype implementation of a shared 3Denvironment manager that is distributed across displays, machines, andoperating systems. We also discuss two methods we are exploring forhandling information privacy in such an environment.\"                                                                                         (pdf)                                                 (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           What is the complexity of surface integration?                                        H. Wozniakowski, A. G. Werschulz                    1999-03-18                    We study the worst case complexity of computing $\\varepsilon$-approximations of surface integrals. This problem has two sources of partial information: the integrand~$f$ and the function~$g$ defining the surface. The problem is nonlinear in its dependence on~$g$. Here, $f$ is an $r$~times continuously differentiable scalar function of $l$~variables, and $g$ is an $s$~times continuously differentiable injective function of $d$ variables with $l$~components. We must have $d\\le l$ and $s\\ge1$ for surface integration to be well-defined. Surface integration is related to the classical integration problem for functions of $d$~variables that are $\\min\\{r,s-1\\}$ times continuously differentiable. This might suggest that the complexity of surface integration should be $\\Theta((1/\\varepsilon)^{d/\\min\\{r,s-1\\}})$. Indeed, this holds when $d<l$ and $s=1$, in which case the surface integration problem has infinite complexity. However, if $d\\le l$ and $s\\ge 2$, we prove that the complexity of surface integration is $O((1/\\varepsilon)^{d/\\min\\{r,s\\}})$. Furthermore, this bound is sharp whenever $d<l$.

Traub, A. G. Werschulz                    1999-03-18                    This is an article that will appear in the {\\em Encyclopedia ofOptimization\\/} (Kluwer, 2000). It concerns optimization in twosenses. The first is that informaion-based complexity (IBC) is thestudy of the minimal computational resources to solve continuousmathematical problems. The second is that the computationalcomplexity of optimization problems is one of the areas studied inIBC. We discuss IBC and information-based optimization in turn.

Traditional telephony services, such as callforwarding, transfer, and 800 number services, can be enhanced byinteraction with email, web, and directory services. Additional mediatypes, like video and interactive chat, can be added as well. One ofthe challenges in providing these services is how to effectivelyprogram them. Programming these services requires decisions regardingwhere the code executes, how it interfaces with the protocols thatdeliver the services, and what level of control the code has. In thispaper, we consider this problem in detail. We develop requirements forprogramming Internet telephony services, and we show that at least twosolutions are required --- one geared for service creation by trustedusers (such as administrators), and one geared for service creation byuntrusted users (such as consumers). We review existing techniques forservice programmability in the Internet and in the telephone network,and extract the best components of both. The result is a CommonGateway Interface (CGI) that allows trusted users to developservices, and the Call Processing Language (CPL) that allows untrustedusers to develop services.

Pinpointing bottlenecks in a network is very helpful incongestion control and performance tuning. Measuring link bandwidthscan help identifying such bottlenecks. Existing tools for bandwidthmeasurement like Pathchar, Bing and Bprobe assume symmetriclinks. Hence their results will be incomplete or incorrect in thepresence of asymmetric links. It becomes important to considerasymmetric links, as they are gaining popularity in recentyears. Examples are ADSL lines, Cable modems, Satellite links, and 56Kmodems. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can measure eachhop's link bandwidth in both directions in an IP network. Therefore,it is trivial to detect asymmetry of a link. We performed severalexperiments to validate our algorithm. We also discuss some factorsthat can adversely affect the precision and/or correctness ofbandwidth measurement, and suggest possible solutions.

Plana                    1999-02-09                    In this thesis, I advocate the use of macromodules to design andbuild robust and performance-competitive asynchronous systems. The contributions of the work relate to different aspects ofthe design of asynchronous macromodular systems.First, an architectural optimization for 4-phase systems isintroduced. The goal of the optimization is to increase theperformance of a system by increasing the level of concurrent activityin the sequencing of data processing stages. In particular, three newasynchronous sequencers are designed, which increase the throughputof the system. Existing asynchronous datapaths do not operatecorrectly at this increased level of concurrency: data hazardsmay result. Interlock mechanisms are introduced to insure correctoperation. The technique can also be regarded as a low-poweroptimization: The increased throughput can be traded for a significantreduction in the power consumption of the entire system. SPICEsimulation results show that the new sequencers allow roughly twicethe throughput of non-concurrent sequencers. The simulations also show                                                                                         (pdf)                                                 (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Implementing Intelligent Network Services with the Session Initiation Protocol                                        Jonathan Lennox, Henning Schulzrinne, Thomas F.

In our context, we are less concerned about incrementalupdating of the index, since we can rebuild indexes in response tobatch updates relatively quickly. Our primary concerns are the timetaken for a lookup, and the space occupied by the index structure.We study indexing techniques for main memory, including hash indexes,binary search trees, T-trees, B+-trees, interpolation search, andbinary search on arrays. At one extreme, hash-indexes provide fastlookup but require a lot of space. At another extreme, binary searchon an array requires no additional space beyond the array, butperforms relatively poorly. An analysis of binary search on an arrayshows that it has poor reference locality, leading to many cachemisses and slow lookup times.Our goal is to provide faster lookup times than binary search bypaying better attention to reference locality and cache behavior,without using substantial extra space. We propose a new indexingtechnique called \"Cache-Sensitive Search Trees\" (CSS-trees). Ourtechnique stores a directory structure on top of a sorted array. Thedirectory represents a balanced search tree stored itself as an array.Nodes in this search tree are designed to have size matching thecache-line size of the machine. Because we store the tree in an arrayNodes in this search tree are designed to have size matching thecache-line size of the machine. Because we store the tree in an arraystructure, we do not have to store internal-node pointers; child nodescan be found by performing arithmetic on array offsets.We provide an analytic comparison of the algorithms based on theirtime and space requirements. We have implemented all of thetechniques, and present a performance study on two popular modernmachines. We demonstrate that with a small space overhead, we canreduce the cost of binary search on the array by more than a factor oftwo. We also show that our technique dominates B+-trees, T-trees, andbinary search trees in terms of both space and time. Our performancegraphs show significantly different rankings of algorithms than shownin a 1986 study by Lehman and Carey. The explanation of thedifference is that during the last twelve years, the relative cost ofa cache miss to that of a CPU instruction cycle has increased by twoorders of magnitude. As a result, it is now much more important todesign techniques with good cache behavior.

Ross, Kazi A. Zaman                    1998-11-24                    Datacube queries compute aggregates over databaserelations at a variety of granularities, and they constitute animportant class of decision support queries. Often one wants onlydatacube output tuples whose aggregate value satisfies a certaincondition, such as exceeding a given threshold. For example, onemight ask for all combinations of model, color, and year of cars(including the special value ``ALL'' for each of the dimensions) forwhich the total sales exceeded a given amount of money. Computing a selection over a datacube can naively be done by computingthe entire datacube and checking if the selection condition holds foreach tuple in the result. However, it is often the case thatselections are relatively restrictive, meaning that a lot of workcomputing datacube tuples is ``wasted'' since those tuples don't satisfythe selection condition. Our approach is to develop algorithms for processing a datacube queryusing the selection condition internally during the computation. Bymaking use of the selection condition within the datacube computation,we can safely prune parts of the computation and end up with a moreefficient computation of the answer. Our first technique, called``specialization'', uses the fact that a tuple in the datacube does notmeet the given threshold to infer that all finer level aggregatescannot meet the threshold. We propose a scheme of specializationtransformations on the underlying data sets, using properties of theaggregates and threshold functions. Our second technique is called ``generalization'', and applies in the casewhere the actual value of the aggregate is not needed in the output,but used just to compare with the threshold. Generalization uses thefact that a tuple meets the given threshold to infer that all coarserlevel aggregates also meet the threshold. We also propose a scheme ofgeneralization transformations.We demonstrate the efficiency of these techniques by implementing themwithin the sparse datacube algorithm of Ross and Srivastava. Wepresent a performance study using synthetic and real-world data sets.Our results indicate substantial performance improvements for querieswith selective conditions.

Arthur G. Werschulz                    1998-11-02                    We study the complexity of approximating the Stieltjes integral$\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dg(x)$ for functions $f$ having $r$ continuousderivatives and functions $g$ whose $s$th derivative has boundedvariation. Let $r(n)$ denote the $n$th minimal error attainable byapproximations using at most~$n$ evaluations of $f$ and~$g$, and let$\\mathop{\\rm comp}(\\varepsilon)$ denote the $\\varepsilon$-complexity(the minimal cost of computing an $\\varepsilon$-approximation). Weshow that $r(n)\\asymp n^{-\\min\\{r,s+1\\}}$ and that $\\mathop{\\rm comp}(\\varepsilon)\\asymp\\varepsilon^{-1/\\min\\{r,s+1\\}}$. We also present an algorithm that computes an$\\varepsilon$-approimation at nearly-minimal cost.

Although meta-learning promotes scalability and accuracy ina simple and straightforward manner, brute force meta-learningtechniques can result in large, redundant, inefficient and some timesinaccurate meta-classifier hierarchies. In this paper we exploreseveral methods for evaluating classifiers and composingmeta-classifiers, we expose ther limitations and we demonstrate thatmeta-learning combined with certain pruning methods has the potentialto achieve similar or even better performance results in a much morecost effective manner.

Such Extended Transaction Models (ETM) have been proposedand implemented by building application-specific databases for theSDEs.With the development of World Wide Web (WWW), there have been a numberof efforts to build SDEs on top of the WWW. Using web serversas the databases to store the software artifacts provided us with a newchallenge: how to implement the ETMs in such web-based SDEs without requiringthe web servers to be customized specifically according to the applicationdomains of the SDEs.This paper presents our experiences of integrating transactionservices into web based SDEs. We evolved from the traditional approachof building a transaction management component that operated on top ofa dedicated database to the external transaction server approach. Atransaction server, called JPernLite, was built to operateindependently of the web servers and provide the necessaryextensibility for SDEs to implement their ETMs. The transaction servercan be integrated into the SDE via a number of interfaces, and wediscuss the pros and cons of each alternative in detail.

Kaiser                    1998-03-26                    Concurrency control is one of the key problems in design and implementation of collaborative systems such as hypertext/hypermedia systems, CAD/CAM systems and software development environments. Most existing systems store data in specialized databases with built-in concurrency control policies, usually implemented via locking.It is desirable to construct such collaborative systems on top of the World Wide Web, but most web servers do not support even conventional transactions, let alone distributed (multi-website) transactions or flexible concurrency control mechanisms oriented towards teamwork - such as event notification, shared locks and fine granularity locks.We present a transaction server that operates independently of web servers or the collaborative systems, to fill the concurrency control gap. The transaction server by default enforces the conventional atomic transaction model, where sets of operations are performed in an all-or-nothing fashion and isolated from concurrent users. The server can be tailored dynamically to apply more sophisticated concurrency control policies appropriate for collaboration. The transaction server also supports applications employing information resources other than web servers, such as legacy databases, CORBA objects, and other hypermedia systems. Our implementation permits a wide range of system architecture styles.

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocolthat creates, modifies and terminates associations between Internet endsystems, including conferences and point-to-point calls. SIP supportsunicast, mesh and multicast conferences, as well as combinations ofthese modes. SIP implements services such as call forwarding andtransfer, placing calls on hold, camp-on and call queueing by a smallset of call handling primitives. SIP implementations can re-use partsof other Internet service protocols such as HTTP and the Real-TimeStream Protocol (RTSP). In this paper, we describe SIP, and show howits basic primitives can be used to construct a wide range of telephonyservices.

Nowick                    1998-01-15                    A new method is introduced for the synthesis forlogical initializability of synchronous state machines. The goal isto synthesize a gate-level implementation that is initializable whensimulated by a 3-valued (0,1,X) simulator. The method builds on anexisting approach of Cheng and Agrawal, which uses constrained stateassignment to translate functional initializability into logicalinitializability. Here, a different state assignment method isproposed which, unlike the method of Cheng and Agrawal, is guaranteedsafe and yet is not as conservative. Furthermore, it is demonstratedthat certain new constraints on combinational logic synthesis are bothnecessary and sufficient to insure that the resulting gate-levelcircuit is 3-valued simulatable. Interestingly, these constraints aresimilar to those used for hazard-free synthesis of asynchronouscombinational circuits. Using the above constraints, we present acomplete synthesis for initializability method, targeted to bothtwo-level and multi-level circuits.

Nowick                    1998-01-09                    None of the available minimizers for 2-levelhazard-free logic minimization can synthesizevery large circuits. This limitation has forcedresearchers to resort to manual and automatedcircuit partitioning techniques. This paperintroduces two new 2-level logic minimizers:ESPRESSO-HF, a heuristic method which is looselybased on ESPRESSO-II, and IMPYMIN, an exact methodbased on implicit data structures.Both minimizers can solve all currently availableexamples, which range up to 32 inputs and 33 outputs.These include examples that have never been solved before.For examples that can be solved by other minimizers ourmethods are several orders of magnitude faster.As by-products of these algorithms, we also presenttwo additional results. First, we introduce a fast newalgorithm to check if a hazard-free covering problemcan feasibly be solved. Second, we introduce a novelformulation of the 2-level hazard-free logic minimizationproblem by capturing hazard-freedom constraints withina synchronous function by adding new variables.

Users seek a method of securingtheir data with maximum comfort and minimum additional requirements ontheir part; they want a security system that protects any files usedby any of their applications, without resorting toapplication-specific encryption methods. Performance is an importantfactor to users since encryption can be time consuming. Operatingsystem vendors want to provide this functionality but withoutincurring the large costs of developing a new file system.This paper describes the design and implementation of Cryptfs -- afile system that was designed as a stackable Vnode layer loadablekernel module. Cryptfs operates by \"encapsulating\" a client filesystem with a layer of encryption transparent to the user.Being kernel resident, Cryptfs performs better than user-level or NFSbased file servers such as CFS and TCFS. It is 2 to 37 times faster onmicro-benchmarks such as read and write; this translates to 12-52\\%application speedup, as exemplified by a large build. Cryptfs offersstronger security by basing its keys on process session IDs as well asuser IDs, and by the fact that kernel memory is harder toaccess. Working at and above the vnode level, Cryptfs is more portablethan a file system which works directly with native media such asdisks and networks. Cryptfs can operate on top of any other nativefile system such as UFS/FFS and NFS. Finally, Cryptfsrequires no changes to client file systems or remote servers.

Numerous users read USENET newsgroups daily forentertainment, work, study, and more. USENET News servers have seen agradual increase in the traffic exchanged between them, to a pointwhere the hardware and software supporting the servers is no longercapable of meeting demand, at which point the servers begin \"dropping\"articles they could not process. The rate of this increase has beenfaster than software or hardware improvements were able to keep up,resulting in much time and effort spent by administrators upgradingtheir news systems.One of the primary reasons for the slowness of news servers has beenthe need to process many articles in very large flat directoriesrepresenting newsgroups such as control. cancel andmisc.jobs.offered. A large portion of the resources is spent onprocessing articles in these few newsgroups. Most Unix directoriesare organized as a linear unsorted sequence of entries. Largenewsgroups can have hundreds of thousands of articles in onedirectory, resulting in significant delays processing any singlearticle.Usenetfs is a file system that rearranges the directory structure frombeing flat to one with small directories containing fewer articles. Bybreaking the structure into smaller directories, it improves theperformance of looking for, creating, or deleting files, since theseoperations occur on smaller directories. Usenetfs takes advantage ofarticle numbers; knowing that file names representing articles arecomposed of digits helps to bound the size of the smallerdirectories. Usenetfs improves overall performance by at least 22\\%for average news servers; common news server operations such aslooking up, adding, and deleting articles are sped up by as much asseveral orders of magnitude.Usenetfs was designed and implemented as a stackable Vnode layerloadable kernel module. It operates by \"encapsulating\" a client filesystem with a layer of directory management. To the processperforming directory operations through a mounted Usenetfs, alldirectories appear flat; but when inspecting the underlying storagethat it manages, small directories are visible.Usenetfs is small and is transparent to the user. It requires nochange to News software, to other file systems, or to the rest of theoperating system. Usenetfs is more portable than other nativekernel-based file systems because it interacts with the Vnodeinterface which is similar on many different platforms.

Prodromidis                    1997-12-19                    This thesis research concentrates on the problem of managing a distributed collection of intelligent learning agents across large and distributed databases. The main challenge is to identify and address the issues related to the efficiency, scalability,adaptivity and compatibility of these agents and the design andimplemention of a complete and coherent distributed meta-learning systemfor large scale data mining applications. The resulting system should beable to scale with many large databases and make effective use of the available system resources. Furthemore, it should be capable to adapt tochanges in its computational environment and be flexible enough to circumvent variances in database schema definitions. In this thesis proposal we present the architecture of JAM(Java Agents for Meta-learning),a distributed data mining system, and we describe in detail several methods to cope with the issues of scalability, efficiency, adaptivityand compatibility. Through experiments, performed on actual credit cardand other public domain data sets, we evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our approaches and we demonstrate their potential.

Zhou                    1997-12-17                    In this proposal, we present comprehensive andsystematic approaches of building systems that can automaticallygenerate coherent visual discourse for interactive envirornments. Avisual discourse refers to a series of connected visual displays. Acoherent visual discourse requires smooth transitions betweendisplays, consistent designs within and among displays, and effectiveintegration of various components. While our main research goal is todevelop approaches to automatically create coherent, versatile, andinteractive visual discourse, we also emphasize integrating theseapproaches into a general framework to provide a reference model inwhich a specific system is considered an instantiation of theframework. In other words, the framework should consist of a knowledgebase, an inference engine, a visual realizer, and an interactionhandler. As a consequence, not only can a general framework serve as atemplate from which a specific generation system can be instantiated,but the framework also can be used as a base for comparing orevaluating different systems. We concentrate on the basic issuesinvolved in developing comprehensive and systematic approaches toensure a visual discourse's coherence, versatility, andinteractivity. In particular, To ensure coherence, we have establisheda set of comprehensive design criteria to measure both expressivenessand effectiveness of a visual discourse. To provide versatility, weaddress the design of visual discourse for heterogeneousinformation. Within such discussions, heterogeneous information refersto both quantitative and qualitative, or static and dynamicinformation. In addition, we are also concerned with characterizingand employing different visual media and a wide variety of visualtechniques. To support interaction, we integrate many conventionaluser interface metaphors and styles into visual discourse design andexplore reactive planning approaches to provide proper response touser interactions. To establish the framework, we identify variousknowledge sources and determine effective knowledge representationparadigms in constructing the knowledge base. We emphasize theefficiency, usability, and flexibility issues in modeling theinference engine. We are concerned with portability andparallelization issues in building the visual realizer, and we alsotake into account interaction capabilities for interactiveenvironments. We describe a system called IMPROVISE (IllustrativeMetaphor Production in Reactive Object-oriented VISual Environments)that serves as a proof-of-concept prototype. IMPROVISE is built basedon our framework, aiming to automatically generate coherent visualdiscourse for various application domains in interactiveenvironments. IMPROVISE has been used in two testbed applicationdomains to demonstrate its generality and flexibility. Examples fromboth domains will be given to illustrate IMPROVISE's generationprocess and to identify the future research areas.

Arthur G. Werschulz                    1997-09-12                    We are concerned with the complexity of $2m$thorder elliptic two-point boundary-value problems $Lu=f$. Previouswork on the complexity of these problems has generally assumed that wehad partial information about the right-hand side~$f$ and completeinformation about the coefficients of~$L$, often making unrealisticassumptions about the smoothness of the coefficients of~$L$. In thispaper, we study problems in which $f$ has $r$ derivatives in the$L_p$-sense and for~$L$ having the usual divergence form $$Lv =\\sum_{0\\le i,j\\le m} (-1)^i D^i(a_{i,j}D^jv),$$ with $a_{i,j}$ being$r_{i,j}$-times continuously differentiable. We find that ifcontinuous information is permissible, then the$\\varepsilon$-complexity is proportional to$(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/(\\tilde r+m)}$, where $$\\tilder=\\min\\{\\,r,\\min_{0\\le i,j\\le m} \\{ r_{i,j}-i \\}\\,\\},$$ and show thata finite element method (FEM) is optimal. If only standardinformation (consisting of function and/or derivative evaluations) isavailable, we find that the complexity is proportional to$(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/{r_{\\mathop{\\rm min}}}}$, where $$r_{\\mathop{\\rmmin}}=\\min\\{\\,r,\\min_{0\\le i,j\\le m} \\{ r_{i,j} \\}\\,\\},$$ and we showthat a modified FEM (which uses only function evaluations, and notderivatives) is optimal.

When applied to financial tradingstrategies, competitive analysis leads to the development ofstrategies with minimum relative performance risk. This approach istoo inflexible. Many investors are interested in managing their risk:they may be willing to increase their risk for some form ofreward. They may also have some forecast of the future. In this paper,we extend competitive analysis to provide a framework in whichinvestors can develop optimal trading strategies based on their risktolerance and forecast. We first define notions of risk and rewardthat are smooth extensions of classical competitive analysis. We thenillustrate our ideas using the ski-rental problem, and analyze afinancial game using the risk-reward framework.

Passonneau                    1997-06-05                    Studies of the contextual and linguistic factorsthat constrain discourse phenomena such as reference are coming todepend increasingly on annotated language corpora. In preparing thecorpora, it is important to evaluate the reliability of theannotation, but methods for doing so have not been readily available.In this report, I present a method for computing reliability ofcoreference annotation. First I review a method for applying theinformation retrieval metrics of recall and precision to coreferenceannotation proposed by Marc Vilain and his collaborators. I show howthis method makes it possible to construct contingency tables forcomputing Cohen's Kappa, a familiar reliability metric. By comparingrecall and precision to reliability on the same data sets, I also showthat recall and precision can be misleadingly high. Because Kappafactors out chance agreement among coders, it is a preferable measurefor developing annotated corpora where no pre-existing targetannotation exists.

Our approach is included in a system, calledSUMMONS which presents news summaries to the user in a naturallanguage form along with appropriate background (historical)information from both textual (newswire) and structured (database)knowledge sources. The system presents novel approaches to severalproblems: summarization of multiple sources, summarization of multiplearticles, symbolic summarization through text understanding andgeneration, asynchronous summarization and generation of textualupdates.We pay specific attention to the generation of summaries that includedescriptions of entities such as people and places. We show how certainclasses of lexical resources can be automatically extracted from on-linecorpora and used in the generation of textual summaries. We describe ourapproach to solving the interoperability problem of the various componentsby wrapping all system modules with facilitators which effect thecommunication between the components using a standardized language.

Nayar, Simon Baker                    1997-04-23                    Conventional video cameras have limited fields ofview which make them restrictive for certain applications incomputational vision. A catadioptric sensor uses a combination oflenses and mirrors placed in a carefully arranged configuration tocapture a much wider field of view. When designing a catadioptricsensor, the shape of the mirror(s) should ideally be selected toensure that the complete catadioptric system has a single effectiveviewpoint. The reason a single viewpoint is so desirable is that it isa requirement for the generation of pure perspective images from thesensed image(s). In this paper, we derive and analyze the completeclass of single-lens single-mirror catadioptric sensors which satisfythe fixed viewpoint constraint. Some of the solutions turn out to bedegenerate with no practical value, while other solutions lead torealizable sensors. We also derive an expression for the spatialresolution of a catadioptric sensor, and include a preliminaryanalysis of the defocus blur caused by the use of a curved mirror.

In this paper, weconsider the class of weighted $\\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norms as potentialfitting functions and study the effect which the choice of fittingfunction has on one particular aspect of performance, namely parameterestimation accuracy. We first derive an optimality criterion basedupon how far an ideal feature instance is perturbed around the featuremanifold when noise is added to it. We then show that a first-order(linear) approximation to the feature manifold results in theEuclidean $\\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norm being optimal. We next showempirically that for non-linear manifolds the Euclidean$\\mathrm{L}^{2}$ norm is no longer, in general, optimal. Finally, wepresent the results of several experiments comparing the performanceof various weighting functions on a number of ubiquitous features.

Werschulz                    1997-03-26                    We study the complexity of second-order indefiniteelliptic problems $-\\mathop{\\rm div}(a\\nabla u) + bu=f$ (withhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions) over a $d$-dimensionaldomain~$\\Omega$, the error being measured in the $H^m(\\Omega)$-norm.The problem elements~$f$ belong to the unit ball of~$W^{r,p}(\\Omega)$,where $p\\in[2,\\infty]$ and $r>d/p$. Information consists of(possibly-adaptive) noisy evaluations of $f$, $a$, or~$b$ (or theirderivatives). The absolute error in each noisy evaluation is atmost~$\\delta$. We find that the $n$th minimal radius for this problemis proportional to $n^{-r/d}+\\delta$, and that a noisy finite elementmethod with quadrature (FEMQ), which uses only function values, andnot derivatives, is a minimal error algorithm. This noisy FEMQ can beefficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using theseresults, we find tight bounds on the $\\varepsilon$-complexity (minimalcost of calculating an $\\varepsilon$-approximation) for this problem,said bounds depending on the cost~$c(\\delta)$ of calculating a$\\delta$-noisy information value. As an example, if the cost of a$\\delta$-noisy evaluation is $c(\\delta)=\\delta^{-s}$ (for $s>0$), thenthe complexity is proportional to $(1/\\varepsilon)^{d/r+s}$.

Mumick, Jun Rao, Kenneth A. Ross                    1997-03-14                    We consider a variant of the view maintenance problem: How does one keep a materialized view up-to-date when the view definition itself changes? Can one do better than recomputing the view from the base relations? Traditional view maintenance tries to maintain the materialized view in response to modifications to the base relations; we try to ``adapt'' the view in response to changes in the view definition.Such techniques are needed for applications where the user can changequeries dynamically and see the changes in the results fast. Dataarchaeology, data visualization, and dynamic queries are examples ofsuch applications.We consider all possible redefinitions of SQL\\Select-\\From-\\Where-\\Groupby-\\Having, \\Union, and \\Minus\\ views, and show howthese views can be adapted using the old materialization for the caseswhere it is possible to do so. We identify extra informationthat can be kept with a materialization to facilitate redefinition.Multiple simultaneous changesto a view can be handledwithout necessarily materializing intermediate results. Weidentify guidelines for users and database administrators that can beused to facilitate efficient view adaptation.We perform a systematic experimental evaluation of our proposedtechniques. Our evaluation indicates that adaptation is more efficient thanrematerialization in most cases. Certain adaptation techniques can be up to1,000 times better. We also point out the physical layouts that can benefitadaptation.

The hypermedia represents allplausible multimedia artifacts concerned with the collaborativetask(s) at hand that can be placed or generated on-line, fromapplication-specific materials (e.g., source code, chip layouts,blueprints) to formal documentation to digital library resources toinformal email and chat transcripts. The environment capabilitiesinclude both internal (hypertext) and external (link server) linksamong these artifacts, which can be added incrementally as usefulconnections are discovered; project-specific hypermedia search andbrowsing; automated construction of artifacts and hyperlinks accordingto the semantics of the group and individual tasks and the overallprocess workflow; application of tools to the artifacts; andcollaborative work for geographically dispersed teams.We present a general architecture for what we call hypermedia {\\emsubwebs}, and imposition of {\\em groupspace} services operating onshared subwebs, based on World Wide Web technology --- which could beapplied over the Internet and/or within an organizational intranet.We describe our realization in OzWeb, which reuses object-orienteddata management for application-specific subweb organization, andworkflow enactment and cooperative transactions as built-in groupspaceservices, which were originally developed for the Oz process-centeredsoftware development environment framework. Further, we present ageneral architecture for a WWW-based distributed tool launchingservice. This service is implemented by the generic Rivendellcomponent, which could be employed in a stand-alone manner, but hasbeen integrated into OzWeb as an example ``foreign'' (i.e., add-on)groupspace service.

With the coming age ofubiquitous network computing, it is likely that orders of magnitudemore data in databases will be available for various learning problemsof real world importance. Some learning algorithms assume that theentire data set fits into main memory, which is not feasible formassive amounts of data, especially for applications in data mining.One approach to handling a large data set is to partition the data setinto subsets, run the learning algorithm on each of the subsets, andcombine the results. Moreover, data can be inherently distributedacross multiple sites on the network and merging all the data in onelocation can be expensive or prohibitive.In this thesis we propose, investigate, and evaluate a {\\itmeta-learning} approach to integrating the results of multiplelearning processes. Our approach utilizes machine learning to guidethe integration. We identified two main meta-learning strategies:{\\it combiner} and {\\it arbiter}. Both strategies are independent tothe learning algorithms used in generating the classifiers. Thecombiner strategy attempts to reveal relationships among the learnedclassifiers' prediction patterns. The arbiter strategy tries todetermine the correct prediction when the classifiers have differentopinions. Various schemes under these two strategies have beendeveloped. Empirical results show that our schemes can obtainaccurate classifiers from inaccurate classifiers trained from datasubsets. We also implemented and analyzed the schemes in a paralleland distributed environment to demonstrate their scalability.

Koenderink                    1996-07-20                    In this work, we investigate the visual appearanceof real-world surfaces and the dependence of appearance on scale,viewing direction and illumination direction. At fine scale, surfacevariations cause local intensity variation or image texture. Theappearance of this texture depends on both illumination and viewingdirection and can be characterized by the BTF (bidirectional texturefunction). At sufficiently coarse scale, local image texture is notresolvable and local image intensity is uniform. The dependence ofthis image intensity on illumination and viewing direction isdescribed by the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction). We simultaneously measure the BTF and BRDF of over 60different rough surfaces, each observed with over 200 differentcombinations of viewing and illumination direction. The resulting BTFdatabase is comprised of over 12,000 image textures. To enableconvenient use of the BRDF measurements, we fit the measurements totwo recent models and obtain a BRDF parameter database.

In this paper, we present a fileprefetching mechanism that is based on on-line analytic modeling ofinteresting system events and is transparent to higher levels. Themechanism, incorporated into a client's file cache manager, seeks tobuild semantic structures, called access trees, that capture thecorrelations between file accesses. It then heuristically uses thesestructures to represent distinct file usage patterns and exploits themto prefetch files from a file server. We show results of a simulationstudy and of a working implementation. Measurements suggest that ourmethod can predict future file accesses with an accuracy around 90\\%,that it can reduce cache miss rate by up to 47\\% and applicationlatency by up to 40\\%. Our method imposes little overhead, even underantagonistic circumstances.

The algorithms are duals: Jive-joinrange-partitions input relation tuple-ids then processes eachpartition, while Slam-join forms ordered runs of input relationtuple-ids and then merges the results. Each algorithm has featuresthat make it preferable to the other depending on the context in whichit is being used. Both algorithms make a single sequential passthrough each input relation, in addition to one pass through the joinindex and two passes through a temporary file whose size is half thatof the join index. Both algorithms perform this efficiently even whenthe relations are much larger than main memory, as long as the numberof blocks in main memory is of the order of the square root of thenumber of blocks in the smaller relation. By storing intermediate andfinal join results in a vertically partitioned fashion, our algorithmsneed to manipulate less data in memory at a given time than otheralgorithms. Almost all the I/O of our algorithms is sequential, thusminimizing the impact of seek and rotational latency. The algorithmsare resistant to data skew and adaptive to memory fluctuations. Theycan be extended to handle joins of multiple relations by usingmultidimensional partitioning while still making only a single passover each input relation. They can also be extended to handle joinsof relations that do not satisfy the memory bound by recursivelyapplying the algorithms. We also show how selection conditions can beincorporated into the algorithms. Using a detailed cost model, thealgorithms are analyzed and compared with competing algorithms. Forlarge input relations, our algorithms perform significantly betterthan Valduriez's algorithm and hash join algorithms. An experimentalstudy is also conducted to validate the analytical results and todemonstrate the performance characteristics of each algorithm inpractice.

We report on numerical testingwhich compares low discrepancy and Monte Carlo algorithms on theevaluation of financial derivatives. The testing is performed on aCollateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) which is formulated as thecomputation of ten integrals of dimension up to 360. We tested two low discrepancy algorithms (Sobol and Halton) and tworandomized algorithms (classical Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo combinedwith antithetic variables). We conclude that for this CMO the Sobolalgorithm is always superior to the other algorithms. We believe thatit will be advantageous to use the Sobol algorithm for many othertypes of financial derivatives. Our conclusion regarding the superiority of the Sobol algorithm alsoholds when a rather small number of sample points are used, animportant case in practice. We have built a software system called FINDER for computing highdimensional integrals. Routines for computing Sobol points have beenpublished. However, we incorporated major improvements in FINDER andwe stress that the results reported here were obtained using thissoftware. The software system FINDER runs on a network of heterogeneousworkstations under PVM 3.2 (Parallel Virtual Machine). Sinceworkstations are ubiquitous, this is a cost-effective way to do verylarge computations fast. The measured speedup is at least $.9N$ for$N$ workstations, $N \\leq 25$. The software can also be used tocompute high dimensional integrals on a single workstation.

An alternative to Monte Carlo is touse ``low discrepancy'' methods. Theory suggests that low discrepancymethods might be superior to the Monte Carlo method. We compared theperformance of low discrepancy methods with Monte Carlo on aCollateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) with ten tranches. We foundthat a particular low discrepancy method based on Sobol pointsconsistently outperforms Monte Carlo. Although our tests were for aCMO, we believe it will be advantageous to use the Sobol method formany other types of instruments. We have made major improvements inpublished routines for generating Sobol points which we have embeddedin a software system called FINDER.

A terminology contains descriptionsof concepts, such as UNIVERSITY, which are automatically classified ina taxonomy via subsumption inferences. Individuals such as COLUMBIAare described in terms of those concepts. This thesis enhances thescope and utility of description logics by exploiting new completenessassumptions during problem solving and by extending the expressivenessof descriptions. First, we introduce a predictive concept recognition methodology basedon a new closed terminology assumption (CTA). The terminology isdynamically partitioned by modalities (necessary, optional, andimpossible) with respect to individuals as they are specified. In ourinteractive configuration application, a user incrementally specifiesan individual computer system and its components in collaboration witha configuration engine. Choices can be made in any order and at anylevel of abstraction. We distinguish between abstract and concreteconcepts to formally define when an individual's description may beconsidered finished. We also exploit CTA, together with theterminology's subsumption-based organization, to efficiently track thetypes of systems and components consistent with current choices, inferadditional constraints on current choices, and appropriately restrictfuture choices. Thus, we can help focus the efforts of both user andconfiguration engine. This work is implemented in the K-REP system. Second, we show that a new class of complex descriptions can be formedvia constraint networks over standard descriptions. For example, wemodel plans as constraint networks whose nodes represent actions.Arcs represent qualitative and metric temporal constraints, plusco-reference constraints, between actions. By combiningterminological reasoning with constraint satisfaction techniques,subsumption is extended to constraint networks, allowing automaticclassification of a plan library. This work is implemented in theT-REX system, which integrates and builds upon an existing descriptionlogic system (K-REP or CLASSIC) and temporal reasoner (MATS). Finally, we combine the preceding, orthogonal results to conductpredictive recognition of constraint network concepts. As an example,this synthesis enables a new approach to deductive plan recognition,illustrated with travel plans. This work is also realized in T-REX.

New processenactment directives can be added to the syntax of the processmodeling language, in which the process designer may specifyspecialized behavior for particular tasks or task segments. Theprocess engine is peppered with callbacks to instance-specific code inorder to implement any new directives and to modify the defaultenactment behavior and the kind of assistance that theprocess-centered environment provides to process participants. Werealized our model in the Amber process server, and describe how weexploited Amber's extensibility to replace Oz's native process enginewith Amber and to integrate the result with a mockup of TeamWare.

Weidentify the requirements and possible architectures for eachmodel. The bulk of the paper presents the specific architecture andinfrastructure for homogeneous federation we realized in the \\ozsystem.

In some cases, a new architecture canbe developed, for example to convert a monolithic system to theclient/server paradigm, and the old components plugged into placealong with some new ones. We update a 1994 publication in thisconference series, where we proposed using process modeling andenactment technology to support both construction of systems fromcomponents and re-engineering of systems to permit componentreplacement. This paper describes our experience following thatapproach through two generations of component-oriented process models.

These optimizations allow application ofvoltage scaling, to reduce power consumption while maintaining systemthroughput. In particular, three new asynchronous sequencer designsare introduced, which increase the concurrent activity of the system.We show that existing datapaths will not work correctly at theincreased level of concurrency. To insure correct operation, modifiedlatch and multiplexer designs are presented, for both dual-rail andsingle-rail implementations. The increased concurrency allows theopportunity for substantial system-wide power savings throughapplication of voltage scaling.

Ben-Shaul, George T. Heineman                    1996-01-16                    Decentralized workflow management systems (WFMSs) provide an architecture for multiple, heterogeneous WFMSs to interoperate. Atomicity is a standard correctness model for guaranteeing that a set of operations occurs as an atomic unit, or none of them occur at all. Within a single WFMS, atomicity is the concern of its transaction manager. In a decentralized environment, however, the autonomous transaction managers must find ways to cooperate if an atomic unit is split between multiple WFMSs. This paper describes a flexible atomicity model that enables workflow administrators to specify the scope of multi-site atomicity based upon the desired semantics of multi-site tasks in the decentralized WFMS.

Examples of these mappings are used to construct a continuousfunction that approximates the given data and generalizes for intermediateinstances. Radial basis function (RBF) networks are used to formulate thisapproximating function. A novel method is introduced thatautomatically constructs a RBF network for a given mapping and errorbound. This network is shown to be the smallest network within the error boundfor the given mapping. The integral wavelet transform is used to determine the parameters of the network. Simple one-dimensional examples are used to demonstrate how the network constructed using the transform is superior to oneconstructed using standard ad hoc optimization techniques. The paper concludeswith the automatic generation of a network for a multidimensional problem,namely, object recognition and pose estimation. The results of this application are favorable.

Ben-Shaul, Gail E. Kaiser                    1995-01-01                    Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) has been recognized as a crucial enabling technology for multi-user computer-based systems, particularly incases where synchronous human-human interaction is required betweengeographically dispersed users. Workflow is an emergingtechnology that supports complex business processes in modern corporationsby allowing to explicitly define the process, and by supporting itsexecution in a workflow management system (WFMS). Since workflow inherently involves humans carrying out parts ofthe process, it is only natural to explore how to synergize these twotechnologies. We analyze the relationships between groupware and workflow management, present our general approach to integrating synchronousgroupware tools into a WFMS, and conclude with an example process thatwas implemented in the WFMS and integrated such tools.  Our maincontribution lies in the integration and synchronization of individualgroupware activities into modeled workflow processes, as opposed to beinga built-in part of the workflow WFMS.

Three fundamental problems for CMM designed are discussed. Theirsolutions lead to the training and testing stages of CMM.

Hernandez                    1995-01-01                    Many commercial organizations routinely gather large numbers of databases for various marketing and business analysis functions. The task is to correlate information from different databases byidentifying distinct individuals that appear in a number ofdifferent databases typically in an inconsistent and oftenincorrect fashion.  The problem we study here is the task ofmerging data from multiple sources in as efficient manner aspossible, while maximizing the accuracy of the result.  We callthis the m merge/purge problem.  The key to successfulmerging requires  a means of identifying \"equivalent\"  data fromdiverse sources.  The determination that two pieces of informationare equivalent, and that they represent some aspect of the samedomain entity, depends on sophisticated inference techniques andknowledge of the domain.  We introduce the use of a rule programthat declaratively specifies an \"equational theory\" for this purpose.Furthermore, the number and size of the data sets involved may beso large that parallel and distributed computing systems may bethe only hope for achieving accurate results in a reasonable amountof time with acceptable cost.   In this paper we detail the\"sorted neighborhood\" method that is used by some commercialorganizations to solve merge/purge and present experimental resultsthat demonstrates this approach works well in practice but atgreat expense.  An alternative method based upon clustering isalso presented with a comparative evaluation to the sortedneighborhood method.  We show a means of improving the accuracyof the results based upon a \"multi-pass\" approach that succeeds bycomputing the Transitive Closure over the results of independentruns considering alternative primary key attributes in each pass.The moral is that a multiplicity of \"cheap\" passes produces higheraccuracy than one \"expensive\" pass over the data.

Isochronets   do  notrequire frame  header processing  in  the switches  and, consequently,they  are  scaleable   with  link   speeds,  support  multiple   framestructures, and  are  suitable for  all-optical  implementations.  Theelectronic   switch  has  low  cost   and  uses  simple  off-the-shelfcomponents. The switch interface is simple and provides novel servicessuch  as  guaranteed  Quality  of Service  (QoS)  and  propagation  ofsynchronization   signals   to   upper  protocol   layers,   includingapplications. The switch allows the negotiation of QoS while promotingflexible resource sharing.  This  paper also proposes  an  all-opticalswitch design that can be realized  with current  optical devices. Themodular  switch  designs are  scaleable  in  number of nodes  and linkspeed. Using faster  implementation technology, the electronic  designcan reach scores of gigabits per second, while the all-optical  designcan potentially operate at terabits per second.

In RS,network  nodes switch different routing trees over time. Traffic movesalong routing trees to the roots  during the tree activation period orband. Contrary to circuits, routes do not change frequently,  allowingRS  to   pre-established  routes  for  prolonged  network  operations.Contrary to  packets,  routes can be switched over  time without frameheader processing, allowing RS to scale to any network speed and to beimplemented using all-optical technology. RS  provide flexible qualityof service control and multicasting  through  allocation  of  bands totrees. They can be tuned to span a spectrum of performance  behaviors,outperforming both Circuit or  Packet  Switching, as evidenced by  theperformance  study  in  this  paper.  RS  is the basis  for the  novelIsochronets  high-speed network architecture. Isochronets  operate  atthe  media-access  layer  and can support  multiple framing  protocolssimultaneously. Internetworking  is  reduced  to a  simple media-layerbridging.  A  gigabit-per-second  Isochronet switch prototype has beenimplemented to demonstrate the feasibility of RS.

Arnold, Steven S. Popovich                    1995-01-01                    Message-based architectures have typically been used for integrating anengineer's set of tools as in FIELD and SoftBench. This paper presents ourexperience using a message-based architecture to integrate complex,multi-user environments. Where this style of control integration has beeneffective for encapsulating independent tools within an environment, weshow that these techniques are also useful for integrating environmentsthemselves. Our experience comes from our integration of two types of process-centeredsoftware development environments: a groupware application that implementsa Fagan-style code inspection process and a software development processenvironment where code inspection is a single step in the overall process.We use a message-based mechanism to federate the two process engines suchthat the two process formalisms complement rather than compete with eachother. Moreover, we see that the two process engines can provide somesynergy when used in a single, integrated software process environment,Specifically, the integrated environment uses the process modeling andenactment services of one process engine to customize and extend the codeinspection process implemented in a different process engine. Thecustomization and extension of the original collaborative application wasaccomplished without modifying the application. This was possible becausethe integration mechanism was designed for multi-user, distributedevironments and encouraged the use of an environment's services by otherenvironments. The results of our study indicate that the message-basedarchitecture originally conceived for tool-oriented control integration isequally well-suited for environment integration.

Arthur G. Werschulz                    1995-01-01                    We study the worst case complexity of operator equations $Lu=f$,where $L\\colon G\\to X$ is a bounded linear injection, $G$ is a Hilbertspace, and $X$ is a normed linear space.  Past work on the complexityof such problems has generally assumed that the class~$F$ of problemelements~$f$ to be the unit ball of~$X$.  However, there are manyproblems for which this choice of~$F$ yields unsatisfactory results.Mixed elliptic-hyperbolic problems are one example, the difficultybeing that our technical tools are not strong enoguh to give goodcomplexity bounds.  Ill-posed problems are another example, because weknow that the complexity of computing finite-error approximations isinfinite if $F$ is a ball in~$X$.  In this paper, we pursue anotheridea.  Rather than directly restrict the class~$F$ of problemelements~$f$, we will consider problems that are solution-restricted,i.e., we restrict the class$~U$ of solution elements~$u$.  Inparticular, we assume that~$U$ is the unit ball of a Hilbert space~$W$continuously embedded in~$G$.The main idea is that our problem can be reduced to the standard {\\itapproximation problem\\/} of approximating the embedding of $W$into~$G$.  This allows us to characterize optimal information andalgorithms for our problem.  Then, we consider specific applications.The first application we consider is any problem for which $G$ and~$W$are standard Sobolev Hilbert spaces; we call this the ``standardproblem'' since it includes many problems of practical interest.  Weshow that finite element information and generalized Galerkin methodsare nearly optimal for standard problems.  We then look at ellipticboundary-value problems, Fredholm integral equations of the secondkind, the Tricomi problem (a mixed hyperbolic-elliptic problem arisingin the study of transonic flow), the inverse finite Laplace transform,and the backwards heat equation.  (Note that with the exception of thebackwards heat equation, all of these are standard problems.Moreover, the inverse finite Laplace transform and the backwards heatequation are ill-posed problems.)  We determine the problem complexityand derive nearly optimal algorithms for all these problems.

Mumick, Kenneth A. Ross                    1995-01-01                    We consider a variant of the view maintenance problem: How does onekeep a materialized view up-to-date when the view definition itselfchanges?  Can one do better than recomputing the view from the baserelations?  Traditional view maintenance tries to maintain thematerialized view in response to modifications to the base relations;we try to ``adapt'' the view in response to changes in the viewdefinition.Such techniques are needed for applications where the user can changequeries dynamically and see the changes in the results fast.  Dataarchaeology, data visualization, and dynamic queries are examples ofsuch applications.We consider all possible redefinitions of SQLSelect-From-Where-Groupby-Having, Union, and Except views, and showhow these views can be adapted using the old materialization for thecases where it is possible to do so.  We identify extra informationthat can be kept with a materialization to facilitate redefinition.Multiple simultaneous changes to a view can be handled withoutnecessarily materializing intermediate results.  We identifyguidelines for users and database administrators that can be used tofacilitate efficient view adaptation.

Unger                    1995-01-01                    Transition signaling is a popular technique used in the design of unclocked digital systems.  A number of basic modules have been developed by various researchers for use in such systems, and they have presented ingenious circuits for implementing them.  In this paper, a method is presented for describing the behavior of such modules clearly and concisely by means of transition flow tables.  These tables can be used to generate Huffman type primitive flow tables.  All of the formal (and informal) techniques developed for the design of asynchronous sequential logic circuits can then be applied to develop implementations with attention to problems of hazards, metastability, and the like.  These transition tables may also be useful for describing larger subsystems.

Oz is a process-centered multi-user software developmentenvironment. PCTE is a specification which defines a language independent interface providing support mechanisms for software engineering environments (SEE) populated with CASE tools. Oz is, in theory, a SEE that can be built (or extended) using the services provided by PCTE. Oz historically has had anative OMS component whereas the PCTE OMS is an open data repository with an API for external software tools. Our experiment focused on changing Oz to use the PCTE OMS. This paper describes how several Oz components were changedin order to make the Oz server interface with the PCTE OMS. The resulting system of our experiment is an environment that has process control and integration services provided by Oz, data integration services provided by PCTE, and tool integration services provided by both. We discusses in depth the concurrency control problems that arise in such an environment and their solutions. The PCTE implementation used in our experiment is the Emeraude PCTE V 12.5.1 supplied by Transtar Software Incorporation.

Nayar                    1995-01-01                    The efficiency of pattern recognition is critical when there are a large number of classes to be discriminated, or when the recognition algorithmmust be applied a large number of times. We propose and analyze a generaltechnique, namely pattern rejection, that leads to great efficiencyimprovements in both cases. Rejectors are introduced as algorithms thatvery quickly eliminate from further consideration,most of the classes or inputs (depending on the setting).Importantly, a number of rejectors may be combinedto form a composite rejector, which performs far more effectively than any of itscomponent rejectors. Composite rejectors are analyzed, and conditionsderived which guarantee both efficiency and practicality.A general technique is proposed for  the construction ofrejectors, based on a single assumption about the patternclasses. The generality is shownthrough a close relationship with the Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansion.Further, a comparison with Fisher's discriminant analysis isincluded to illustrate the benefits of pattern rejection.Composite rejectors were constructed for twoapplications, namely, object recognitionand local feature detection. In both cases, a substantialimprovement in efficiency over existing techniques is demonstrated.

Ben-Shaul                    1995-01-01                    This dissertation investigates decentralization of software processesand Process Centered Environments (PCEs), and addresses a wide range ofissues concerned with supporting interoperability and collaborationamong autonomous and heterogeneous processes, both in their definitionand in their execution in possibly physically dispersed PCEs.Decentralization is addressed at three distinct levels of abstraction.The first proposes a generic conceptual model that is both language- andPCE-independent. The second level explores the realization of the modelin a specific PCE, Oz, and its rule-based process modelinglanguage. The third level addresses architectural issues ininterconnecting autonomous PCEs as a basis for process interoperability.Two key concerns guide this research. The first is maximizing localautonomy, so as not to force a priori any global constraints on thedefinition and execution of local processes, unless explicitly andvoluntarily specified by a particular process instance. The secondconcern is tailorability, dynamicity and fine-grained control over thedegree of interoperability.The essence of the interoperability model lies in two abstractionmechanisms --- Treaty and Summit --- for inter-processdefinition and execution, respectively. Treaties enable to specifyshared sub-processes while retaining the privacy of localsub-processes. To promote autonomy, Treaties are established byexplicit and active participation of the involved processes. Topromote fine granularity, Treaties are defined pairwisebetween two collaborating processes and formed over a possibly smallsub-process unit, although multi-site Treaties over large sharedsub-processes can be constructed, if desired. Finally, Treatiesare superimposed on top of pre-existing instantiated processes,enabling their dynamic and incremental establishment andsupporting a decentralized bottom-up approach.Summits are the execution counterparts of Treaties. They support``global'' execution of shared sub-processes involving artifactsand/or users from multiple sites, as well as local execution ofprivate sub-processes. Summits successively alternate between sharedand private execution modes, where the former is used for synchronousexecution of shared activities, and the latter for autonomousexecution of any private subtasks emanating from the shared activitiesas defined in the local processes.

These terms are oftennot found in standard dictionaries. Human translators, not being experts inevery technical or regional domain, cannot produce their translationseffectively. Automatic translation of domain-specific terms is thereforehighly desirable. Most other work on automatic term translation uses statistical informationof words from parallel corpora. Parallel corpora of clean, translated textsare hard to come by whereas there are more noisy, translated texts and manymore monolingual texts in various domains. We propose using noisy paralleltexts and same-domain texts of a pair of languages to translate terms. In our work, we propose using a novel paradigm of pattern matching ofstatistical signals of word features. These features are robust to thesyntactic structure, character sets, language of the text, and to the domain.  We obtain statistical information which is related to thelexical properties of a word and its translation in any other language ofthe same domain. These lexical properties are extracted from the corporaand represented in vector form.  We propose using signal processingtechniques for matching these features vectors of a word to those of itstranslation. Another matching technique we propose is applyingdiscriminative analysis of the word features.  For each word, the variousfeatures are combined into a single vector which is then transformed into asmaller dimension eigenvector for matching.Since most domain specific terms are nouns and noun phrases, we concentrateon translating English nouns and noun phrases into other languages.  Westudy the relationship between English noun phrases and their translationsin Chinese, Japanese and French in parallel corpora. The result of thisstudy is used in our system for translation of English noun phrases intothese other languages from noisy parallel and non-parallel corpora.

Error is measured in the energy norm, and onlystandard information (consisting of function evaluations) isavailable.  In previous work on this problem, the standard assumptionhas been that the class~$F$ of problem elements has been the unit ballof a Sobolev space of fixed smoothness~$r$, in which case the$\\e$-complexity is proportional to $\\e^{-d/r}$.  Given thisexponential dependence on~$d$, the problem is intractable for suchclasses~$F$.  In this paper, we seek to overcome this intractabilityby allowing $F$ to be the unit ball of a space $\\circhrho$ of boundedmixed derivatives, with $\\rho$ a fixed multi-index with positiveentries.  We find that the complexity is proportional to$c(d)(1/\\e)^{1/\\rhomin}[\\ln(1/\\e)]^b$, and we give boundson~$b=b_{\\rho,d}$.  Hence, the problem is tractable in $1/\\e$, withexponent at most~$1/\\rhomin$.  The upper bound on the complexity(which is close to the lower bound) is attained by a modified finiteelement method (MFEM) using discrete blending spline spaces; we obtainan explicit bound (with no hidden constants) on the cost of using thisMFEM to compute $\\e$-approximations.  Finally, we show that for anypositive multi-index ~$\\rho$, the Poisson problem is stronglytractable, and that the MFEM using discrete blended piecewisepolynomial splines of degree~$\\rho$ is a strongly polynomial timealgorithm.  In particular, for the case $\\rho={\\bf 1}$, the MFEM usingdiscrete blended piecewise linear splines produces an$\\e$-approximation with cost at most$$0.839262\\,(c(d)+2)\\left({1\\over\\e}\\right)^{5.07911}.$$                                                                                         (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tractable Reasoning in Knowledge Representation Systems                                        Dalal Mukesh                    1995-01-01                    This document addresses some problems raised by the well-knownintractability of deductive reasoning in even moderately expressiveknowledge representation systems.Starting from boolean constraint propagation (BCP), a previously knownlinear-time incomplete reasoner for clausal propositional theories, wedevelop {\\em fact propagation} (FP) to deal with non-clausal theories, aftermotivating the need for such an extension.  FP is specified using aconfluent rewriting systems, for which we present an algorithm thathas quadratic-time complexity in general, but is still linear-time forclausal theories.  FP is the only known tractable extension of BCP tonon-clausal theories; we prove that it performs strictly moreinferences than CNF-BCP, a previously-proposed extension of BCP tonon-clausal theories.We generalize a refutation reasoner based on FP to a family of soundand tractable reasoners that are ``increasingly complete'' forpropositional theories.  These can be used for anytime reasoning,i.e., they provide partial answers even if they are stoppedprematurely, and the ``completeness'' of the answer improves with thetime used in computing it. A fixpoint construction based on FPgives an alternate characterization of the reasoners in this family,and is used to define a transformation of arbitrary theories intologically-equivalent ``vivid'' theories --- ones for which our FPalgorithm is complete.Our final contribution is to the description of tractable classes ofreasoning problems. Based on FP, we develop a new property, calledbounded intricacy, which is shared by a variety of tractable classesthat were previously presented, for example, in the areas ofpropositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, andOR-databases. Although proving bounded intricacy for these classesrequires domain-specific techniques (which are based on the originaltractability proofs), bounded intricacy is one more tool available forshowing that a family of problems arising in some application istractable. As we demonstrate in the case of constraint satisfactionand disjunctive logic programs, bounded intricacy can also be used touncover new tractable classes.

This thesis  introduces theIsochronets architecture that overcomes both limitations.Isochronets  view frame  motions over links  in  analogy to motions onroads.  In the latter, traffic lights  can synchronize to create greenwaves   of uninterrupted    motion.   Isochronets   accomplish similaruninterrupted motion by  periodically configuring network switches  tocreate  end-to-end routes  in the  network.   Frames flow along  theseroutes with no required header processing at intermediate switches.Isochronets offer several  advantages. First, they  are scaleable withrespect to transmission speeds. Switches merely  configure routes on atime scale  that is significantly longer than  and independent  of theaverage frame   transmission time.  Isochronets do  not  require frameprocessing  and  thus avoid conversions   from  optical to  electronicrepresentations.  They  admit  efficient  optical transmissions  underelectronically controlled switches.Second, Isochronets ensure  QoS  for high-performance applications  interms  of     latency,   jitter,     loss,    and  other       servicequalities. Isochronet switches can give   priority to frames  arrivingfrom selected links.  At one  extreme, they  may   give a source   theright-of-way to the destination by assigning  priority to all links inits path.  Additionally,  other sources  may still transmit   at lowerpriority. At the  other extreme, they  may give no priority to sourcesand  frames en route to  the same destination contend for intermediatelinks. In  between,  Isochronets can accomplish  a myriad  of priorityallocations with diverse QoS.Third, Isochronets  can support  multiple protocols without adaptationbetween different frame  structures. End nodes view  the network  as amedia access layer that accepts frames of arbitrary structure.The main  contributions   of  this thesis  are:  (1)   design   of theIsochronets architecture;  (2) design and  implementation of a gigabitper  second Isochronet switch    (Isoswitch);  (3) definition of   theLoosely-synchronous Transfer Mode  (LTM) and the  Synchronous ProtocolStack  (SPS)  that  add synchronous and  isochronous  services  to anyexisting protocol    stack;  and   (4)    performance evaluation    ofIsochronets.

Kaiser                    1995-01-01                    Database management systems (DBMSs) have been increasingly used for  advanced application domains, such as software development environments,  network management, workflow management systems, computer-aided design  and manufacturing, and managed healthcare.  In these domains, the  standard correctness model of serializability is often too restrictive.  We introduce the notion of a Concurrency Control Language (CCL) that  allows a database application designer to specify concurrency control  policies to tailor the behavior of a transaction manager.  A well-crafted  set of policies defines an extended transaction model.  The necessary  semantic information required by the CCL run-time engine is extracted  from a task manager, a (logical) module by definition included in  all advanced applications.  This module stores task models that encode  the semantic information about the transactions submitted to the DBMS.  We have designed a rule-based CCL, called CORD, and have implemented a  run-time engine that can be hooked to a conventional transaction manager  to implement the sophisticated concurrency control required by advanced  database applications.  We present an architecture for systems based on  CORD and describe how we integrated the CORD engine with the Exodus  Storage Manager to implement Altruistic Locking.

Nayar, Simon Baker, Hiroshi Murase                    1995-01-01                    A large number of visual features are parametric in nature, including,edges, lines, corners, and junctions.We present a general framework for the design andimplementation of detectors for parametrized features.For robustness, we argue in favor of elaborate modeling of featuresas they appear in the physical world. In addition,optical and sensing artifacts are incorporated to achieverealistic feature models in  image domain.Each feature is represented as a densely sampledparameterized manifold in a low-dimensional subspace.During detection, the brightness distribution around eachimage pixel is projected to the subspace. If the projectionlies close to the feature manifold, the exact location ofthe closest manifold point reveals the parameters of thefeature. The concepts of parameter reduction by normalization, dimension reduction, pattern rejection, and efficientsearch are employed to achieve high efficiency.Detectors have beenimplemented for five specific features, namely, step edge (5 parameters),roof edge (5 parameters), line (6 parameters), corner (5 parameters),and circular disc (6 parameters). All five of these detectorswere generated using the same technique by simply inputing different feature models. Detailed experiments are reported on therobustness of detection and the accuracy of parameter estimation.In the case of the step edge, our results are compared with thoseobtained using popular detectors. We conclude with a brief discussionon the use of relaxation to refine outputs from multiple featuredetectors, and sketch a hardware architecture for a generalfeature detection machine.

Under the assumption that the network cannot guarantee the required bounds on delay and jitter, there is a need to accommodate the delay jitter in the end systems. Various methods of jitter smoothing at the end systems and their suitability to audio as well as video transmission have been discussed. An experimental test bed which was  used to investigate these problems is described. Some initial empirical results obtained using this test bedare also presented.

This paper addresses the problem ofprocess-interoperability among decentralized and autonomous PSEEs bypresenting the generic International Alliance model, which consists oftwo elements, namely Treaty and Summit. The Treaty abstraction allowspairwise peer-peer definition of multi-site shared sub-processes thatare integrated inside each of the participating sites, while retaining the definition- and evolution-autonomy of non-sharedlocal sub-processes. Summits are the execution abstraction forTreaty-defined sub-processes. They enact Treaty sub-processes inmultiple sites by successively alternating between shared and privateexecution modes: the former is used for the synchronous execution of theshared activities, and the latter is used for the autonomous executionof any private subtasks emanating from the shared activities.

For example, a videoconference exchange  can  be   very  sensitive  to  the  effective   networkthroughput. Network jitter can  greatly  disrupt a  speech stream. The  mainquestion this  thesis addresses is  how to adapt  multimedia applications tothe QoS delivered by the network and vice versa.Such adaptation is especially important because  current networks are unableto assure  the   QoS required by    applications and the  latter is  usuallyunprepared for  periods of QoS   degradation.  This work introduces the  QoSManagement Environment (QoSME) that provides mechanisms for such adaptation.The main contributions of this thesis are:\\begin{itemize}\\item Language level abstractions for QoS management. The Quality AssuranceLanguage (QuAL) in QoSME enables the specification of how to allocate,monitor, analyze, and adapt to delivered QoS. Applications can express in QuALtheir QoS needs and how to handle potential violations.\\item  Automatic QoS monitoring.  QoSME automatically generates  theinstrumentation to monitor QoS when applications use QuAL constructs.  TheQoSME runtime scrutinizes interactions among applications, transportprotocols, and Operating Systems (OS)  and  collects in  QoS ManagementInformation Bases (MIBs) statistics on the QoS delivered.\\item  Integration of QoS and standard network management. A Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP) agent embedded in QoSME provides  QoS MIB access toSNMP managers.  The latter can use this feature  to monitor end-to-end QoSdelivery and adapt network resource allocation and operations accordingly.\\end{itemize}A partial prototype of QoSME has been released for public access. It runs onSunOS 4.3  and  Solaris 2.3   and supports  communication  on ATM adaptationlayer, ST-II, UDP/IP, TCP/IP, and Unix internal protocols.

Del Corso                    1995-01-01                    This paper addresses the problem of approximating an eigenvectorbelonging to the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrixby the power method. We assume that the startingvector is randomly chosen with uniform distribution over the unit sphere.This paper provides lower and upper as well as asymptotic bounds on therandomized error in the ${\\cal L}_p$ sense, $p\\in[1,+\\infty]$.We prove that it is impossible to achieve bounds that are independentof the ratio between the two largest eigenvalues.This should be contrasted to the problem ofapproximating the largest eigenvalue forwhich Kuczy\\'nski and Wo\\'zniakowski in 1992 proved thatit is possible to bound the randomized error at the $k$-th stepwith a quantity that depends only on $k$ and on the size of the matrix.We prove that the rate of convergence depends on the ratio of the twolargest eigenvalues, on their multiplicities, and on the particularnorm. The rate of convergence is at most linear in the ratio of thetwo largest eigenvalues.

Our model consists of two parts, the map-makerand the navigator. Given a source and a goal, the map-maker derives anavigational path based on the topological relationships between landmarks.A navigational path is generated as a combination of ``parkway'' and``trajectory'' paths, both of which are abstractions of the real world intotopological data structures. Traversing within a parkway enables thenavigator to follow visible landmarks.  Traversing on a trajectory enablesthe navigator to move reliably towards a target, based on shapes formed byvisible landmarks. Error detection and error recovery routines are alsoencoded into the path segments.  The optimal path is further abstractedinto a ``custom map,'' which consists of a list of directionalinstructions, the vocabulary of which is defined by our environmentaldescription language.  Based on the custom map generated by the map-maker,the navigating robot looks for events that are characterized by spatialproperties of the environment.

Kender                    1994-01-01                    In this paper we describe error detection and error recovery methodsapplicable to navigation in large scale unstructured environmentalnavigation. We relax the assumption of error-free following of topologicallandmarks; the navigator is ``permitted'' to makemistakes during its journey. The error detection method involves thenavigator observing its immediate surrounding and checking for one ofseveral types of disparities.The error recovery method is based on a simple fixed set of movements whichis triggered by the navigator's local observation. Alternately described,this work characterizes those environments in which robust topologicalnavigation is possible, including those landmarks which, literally, ``can'tbe missed''. These methods have been implemented on our qualitativeenvironmental navigation system consisting of a camera mounted IBM 7575robot arm.

Current models which depend on metricinformation contain inherent mechanical and sensory uncertainties.Instead we supply the navigator with qualitative information.  Ourmodel consists of two parts, the map-maker and the navigator.  Givena source and a goal, the map-maker derives a navigational path basedon the topological relationships between landmarks. A navigationalpath is generated as a combination of ``parkway'' and ``trajectory''paths, both of which are abstractions of the real world intotopological data structures. Traversing within a parkway enables thenavigator to follow visible landmarks. Traversing on a trajectoryenables the navigator to move reliably into a homogeneous space,based on shapes formed by visible landmarks that are robust topositional and orientational errors. Reliabilitymeasures of parkway and trajectory traversals are defined by appropriateerror models that account for the sensory errors of the navigator, themotor errors of the navigator, and the population of neighboringobjects. Error detection and error recovery methods are also encodedinto the generated path. The optimal path is furtherabstracted into a ``custom map,'' which consists of a list of verbaldirectional instructions, the vocabulary of which is defined by ourenvironmental description language.  Based on the custom map generated bythe map-maker, the navigating robot looks for events that are characterizedby spatial properties of the environment.

To achieve this, the concepts of persistent tool platforms, tool sessions and transaction-like activities will be introducedas the main innovative features of the protocol. We plan to be able to encapsulate and service conveniently classes of tools such asinterpretive systems, databases, medium and large size applications that allowfor incremental binding of parameters and partial retrieving of results, and possibly multi-user tools. Marginal modification and upgrading of the Oz general architecture and components will necessarily be performed.

G Kaiser                    1994-01-01                    The @marvel process-centered environment (PCE) modeled knowledge of thesoftware development process in the form of rules, each representing aprocess step with its prerequisites and consequences.  @marvel enforcedthat prerequisites were satisfied and used backward and forward chainingover the rule base to automate tool invocations.  In order to supportmultiple users, the process engine ensured atomicity of those rule chainsannotated as transactions.  It has recently become clear, however, thatthese three modes of process assistance are not sufficient for all projectsand all users.  Guidance to users regarding the process steps they canperform, monitoring of divergences from the prerequisites and consequencesof a process, delegation of process steps to other users, collaborationamong multiple users working together on a step (or a process fragment),planning of a process in advance, simulation of processes for training oranalysis purposes, and instrumentation of processes for statisticsgathering may also be desirable, and there are probably other modes that wehaven't considered. Yet neither @marvel nor any other existing PCE supportsmore than a handful of built-in process assistance modes. We present thedesign of the new @amber system, which will generalize @marvel and otherrule-based PCEs to support enforcement, automation, atomicity, guidance,monitoring, delegation, collaboration, planning, simulation,instrumentation and potentially other applications.  In particular, @amberwill be fully knowledge-based, tailored by knowledge regarding the@i(process assistance policies) to be supported as well as the @i(processmodel)                                                                                         (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Large Flow Trees: a Lower Bound Computation Tool for Network Optimization                                        Bulent Yener                    1994-01-01                    This paper presents a new method for computing the lower bounds for multihopnetwork design problems which is particularly well suited to lightwavenetworks.  The lower bound can be computed in time polynomial in the networksize.  Consequently, the results in this work yields a tool which can be usedin (i) evaluating the quality of heuristic design algorithms, and (ii)determining a termination criteria during minimization.More specifically, given $N$ stations each with at most $d$ transceivers, andpairwise average traffic values of the stations, the method provides a lowerbound for the combined problem of finding optimum (i) allocation ofwavelengths to the stations (configuration), and (ii) routing of the trafficon this configuration while minimizing {\\em congestion} (i.e. minimizing themaximum flow on any link).The lower bound computation is based on first building {\\em flowtrees} to find a lower bound on the total flow, and then distributingthe total flow over the links to minimize the congestion.

For  example, scheduling  of  processingactivities or network queueing delays  may cause excessive jitter in aspeech stream,  rendering  it difficult  to  understand.  It  is  thusimportant to  establish effective technologies  to ensure  delivery ofQoS required by distributed multimedia applications.        This proposal  presents  a new language for the development ofdistributed   multimedia  applications:   Quality  Assurance  Language(QuAL). QuAL abstractions allow the specification of QoS constraintsexpected from the  underlying computing and communication environment.QuAL specifications are compiled into run time components that monitorthe actual QoS delivered. Upon QoS  violations, application providedexception  handlers  are  signaled to  act  upon  the  faulty  events.Language   level  abstractions  of  QoS  shelter  programs   from  theheterogeneity  of  underlying  infrastructures.  This  simplifies  thedevelopment and maintenance of  multimedia applications and promotestheir portability  and reuse. QuAL generates  Management InformationBases  (MIBs) that  contain QoS statistics per application.  Such MIBsmay  be  used to  integrate  application  level  QoS  management  intostandard network management frameworks.

Heineman,  Gail E. Kaiser                    1994-01-01                    Reengineering a large code base can be a monumental task, and the situationbecomes even worse if the code is concomitantly being modified.  For thepast two years, we have been using the Marvel process centered environment(PCE) for all of our software development and are currently using it todevelop the Oz PCE (Marvel's successor).  Towards this effort, we arereengineering Oz's code base to isolate the process engine, transactionmanager, and object management system as separate components that can bemixed and matched in arbitrary systems.  In this paper, we show how a PCEcan guide and assist teams of users in carrying out code reengineeringwhile allowing them to continue their normal code development.  The keyfeatures to this approach are its incremental nature and the ability of thePCE to automate most of the tasks necessary to maintain the consistency ofthe code base.Key words: Process Centered Environments, Componentization                                                                                         (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Better Semijoins Using Tuple Bit-Vectors                                        Zhe Li, Kenneth A. Ross                    1994-01-01                    This paper presents the idea of ``tuple bit-vectors'' for distributedquery processing.  Using tuple bit-vectors, a new two-way semijoinoperator called 2SJ++ that enhances the semijoin with an essentially``free'' backward reduction capability is proposed. We explore indetail the benefits and costs of 2SJ++ compared with other semijoinvariants, and its effect on distributed query processing performance.We then focus on one particular distributed query processingalgorithm, called the ``one-shot'' algorithm.  We modify the one-shotalgorithm by using 2SJ++ and demonstrate the improvements achieved innetwork transmission cost compared with the original one-shottechnique.  We use this improvement to demonstrate that equipped withthe 2SJ++ technique, one can improve the performance of distributedquery processing algorithms significantly without adding muchcomplexity to the algorithms.

It isshown that multiple virtual rings improve (i) the bound on the lengthof routing, and (ii) the fault tolerance. The hamiltonian virtual rings are studied on the hypercube and thecirculant graphs.  On the circulant graphs, necessary and sufficientconditions for hamiltonian decomposition is established.  On thehypercube three algorithms are designed for an hypercubewith even dimension: (i) an O(N) time algorithm to find twoedge-disjoint hamiltonian circuits, (ii) an $O(N \\log N)$ timealgorithm to find $\\frac{\\log N}{2}$ hamiltonian circuits with onlyepsilon leq $0.1$ common edges, and (iii) a recursive algorithm forthe hamiltonian decomposition of the hypercube with dimension power oftwo. The routing algorithm on multiple virtual rings is which combines the actual routing decision with the internalflow control state. It is shown analytically, and verified bysimulations on the circulants that with the d virtual ringembeddings, a bound of O(N/d) is established on the maximum length ofrouting.

Heineman, Gail E. Kaiser                    1994-01-01                    This paper details our experience using Process Weaver.  We have been usingProcess Weaver for two distinct purposes.  The first concerns a set ofexperiments we are performing to integrate a transaction manager component,called PERN with Process Weaver.  The second is a prototype system forautomatic translation of process modeling formalisms.  We have alreadydeveloped a compiler that translates a process model, created using theSEI-developed Statemate-approach, into a Marvel environment.  We arecurrently designing a way of integrating this compiler with Process Weaverto take advantage of the best features of these three powerfulapplications.

We examine a system with multiclass workloads in which on-lineupdate transactions and long-duration queries progress based onepsilon serializability (ESR).  Our results demonstrate thatsignificant performance enhancements can be achieved with a non-zerotolerable inconsistency ({\\mbox{\\Large$\\epsilon$}}-spec).  With sufficient{\\mbox{\\Large$\\epsilon$}}-spec and limited system resources, both algorithms achieve comparable performance.  However, with low resource contention,ODC performs significantly better than 2PLDC.  Moreover, given a small{\\mbox{\\Large$\\epsilon$}}-spec, ODC returns more accurate results on the committed queries then 2PLDC.

Using tuple bit-vectors, a new two-waysemijoin operator called 2SJ++ that enhances the semijoin with anessentially ``free'' backward reduction capability is proposed. Weexplore in detail the benefits and costs of 2SJ++ compared with othersemijoin variants, and its effect on distributed query processingperformance.  We then focus on one particular distributed queryprocessing algorithm, called the ``one-shot'' algorithm.  We modifythe one-shot algorithm by using 2SJ++ and demonstrate the improvementsachieved in network transmission cost compared with the originalone-shot technique.  We use this improvement to demonstrate thatequipped with the 2SJ++ technique, one can improve the performance ofdistributed query processing algorithms significantly without addingmuch complexity to the algorithms.

We also evaluated performanceimprovement in automatic Chinese tokenization.

Werschulz                    1994-01-01                    Let $F$ be a class of functions defined on a $d$-dimensional domain.Our task is to compute $H^m$-norm $\\e$-approximations to solutions of$2m$th-order elliptic boundary-value problems $Lu=f$ for a fixed~$L$and for $f\\in F$.  We assume that the only information we can computeabout $f\\in F$ is the value of a finite number of continuous linearfunctionals of~$f$, each evaluation having cost~$c(d)$.  Previous workhas assumed that $F$ was the unit ball of a Sobolev space $H^r$ of fixedsmoothness~$r$, and it was found that the complexity of computing an$\\e$-approximation was $\\comp(\\e,d)=\\Theta(c(d)(1/\\e)^{d/(r+m)})$.Since the exponent of $1/\\e$ depends on~$d$, we see that the problemis intractable in~$1/\\e$ for any such $F$ of fixed smoothness~$r$.  Inthis paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting $F$be the unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness.  To be specific,we let $F$ be the unit ball of a Hardy space of analytic functionsdefined over a complex $d$-dimensional ball of radius greater thanone.  We then show that the problem is tractable in~$1/\\e$.  Moreprecisely, we prove that $\\comp(\\e,d)=\\Theta(c(d)(\\ln 1/\\e)^d)$, wherethe $\\Theta$-constant depends on~$d$.  Since for any $p>0$, there is afunction $K(\\cdot)$ such that $\\comp(\\e,d)\\le c(d) K(d)(1/\\e)^p$ forsufficiently small~$\\e$, we see that the problem is tractable, with(minimal) exponent~$0$.  Furthermore, we show how to construct afinite element $p$-method (in the sense of Babu\\u{s}ka) that cancompute an $\\e$-approximation with cost $\\Theta(c(d)(\\ln 1/\\e)^d)$.Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexityalgorithm for $d$-dimensional elliptic problems with analytic data.

LTM  operates  by signalingperiphery nodes when destinations become available. No frame structureis imposed by LTM, thus avoiding  adaptation layers. Additionally, LTMcan  deliver  a  spectrum  of  guaranteed  quality  of  services.  NewSynchronous Protocol Stacks (SPSs) build on LTM by synchronizing theiractivities to LTM  signals. Such signals can  be delivered directly toapplications  that  may  synchronize its operations  to transmissions,thus minimizing buffering due to synchronization mismatches. SPSs  canuse current  transport protocols  unchanged  and, potentially, enhancethem with the real-time capabilities made possible through LTM.

Heineman, Gail E. Kaiser                    1994-01-01                    Research in layered and componentized systems shows the benefit of  dividing the reponsibility of services into separate components.  It is  still an unresolved issue, however, how a system can be created from a  set of existing (independently developed) components.  This issue of  integration is of immense concern to software architects since a proper  solution would reduce duplicate implementation efforts and promote  component reuse.  In this paper we take a step towards this goal within  the domain of software development environments (SDEs) by showing how to  integrate an external concurrency control component, called PERN, with an  environment framework.  We discuss two experiments of integrating PERN  with OZ, a decentralized process centered environment, and ProcessWEAVER,  a commercial process server.  We introduce an architecture for  retrofitting an external concurrency control component into an  environment.Keywords:Componentization, Transactions, Software Architecture, Collaborative Work                                                                                         (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Management of Application Quality of Service                                        Patricia Gomes Soares Florissi ,  Yechiam Yemini                    1994-01-01                    This paper proposes a new language for the development of distributedmultimedia applications: Quality Assurance Language (QuAL). QuALabstractions allow the specification of Quality of Service (QoS)constraints expected from the underlying computing and communicationenvironment. QuAL specifications are compiled into run timecomponents that monitor the actual QoS delivered. Upon QoS violations,application provided exception handlers are signaled to act upon thefaulty events. Language level abstractions of QoS shelter programsfrom the heterogeneity of underlying infrastructures. This simplifiesthe development and maintenance of mul- timedia applications andpromotes their portability and reuse. QuAL generates ManagementInformation Bases (MIBs) that contain QoS statistics per application.Such MIBs may be used to integrate application level QoS managementinto standard network management frameworks.

Paskov                    1994-01-01                    High-dimensional integrals are usually solved with Monte Carloalgorithms although theory suggests that low discrepancy algorithmsare sometimes superior.  We report on numerical testing which compareslow discrepancy and Monte Carlo algorithms on the evaluation offinancial derivatives. The testing is performed on a CollateralizedMortgage Obligation (CMO) which is formulated as the computation often integrals of dimension up to 360.We tested two low discrepancy algorithms (Sobol and Halton) and tworandomized algorithms (classical Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo combinedwith antithetic variables). We conclude that for this CMO the Sobolalgorithm is always superior to the other algorithms. We believe thatit will be advantageous to use the Sobol algorithm for many othertypes of financial derivatives.Our conclusion regarding the superiority of the Sobol algorithm alsoholds when a rather small number of sample points are used, animportant case in practice.We built a software system which runs on a network of heterogeneousworkstations under PVM 3.2 (Parallel Virtual Machine). Sinceworkstations are ubiquitous, this is a cost-effective way to do verylarge computations fast.  The measured speedup is at least .9N for Nworkstations, $N \\leq 25$. The software can also be used to compute highdimensional integrals on a single workstation.

They occupy aposition intermediate between  active  and  deductive  databases,with  respect  to the level of abstraction of the underlying rulelanguage.  The operational semantics of the rule language  influ-ences the problem solving strategy, while the architecture of theprocessing environment determines efficiency and scalability.In this paper, we present elements of the PARADISER  architectureand its kernel rule language, PARULEL.  The PARADISER environmentprovides support for parallel and distributed evaluation of  ruleprograms,  as well as static and dynamic load balancing protocolsthat predictively balance a computation at runtime.  This  combi-nation  of  features results in a scalable database rule and com-plex query processing architecture. We  validate  our  claims  byanalyzing  the  performance  of the system for two realistic testcases. In particular, we show how the performance of  a  parallelimplementation of transitive closure is significantly improved bypredictive dynamic load balancing.

Stolfo                    1994-01-01                    In this paper, we present new algorithms to balance the  computa-tion  of parallel hash joins over heterogeneous processors in thepresence of data skew and external loads.  Heterogeneity  in  ourmodel  consists  of disparate computing elements, as well as gen-eral purpose computing ensembles that  are  subject  to  externalloading.   Data  skew appears as  significant non-uniformities inthe distribution of attribute values of underlying relations thatare involved in a join.We develop cost models and predictive dynamic load balancing pro-tocols  to  detect  imbalance  during the computation of a singlelarge join. Our algorithms can account for imbalance due to  dataskew  as well as heterogeneity in the computing environment. Sig-nificant performance gains are reported for a wide range of  testcases on a prototype implementation of the system.Keywords:Load Balancing, Parallel Join, Hash Join, Data Skew, Parallel Processing,Heterogeneity                                                                                         (ps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Expanding the Repertoire of Process-based Tool Integration                                        Giuseppe Valetto                    1994-01-01                    The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement a new protocolfor Black Box tool enveloping, in the context of the Oz ProcessCentered Environment, as an auxiliary mechanism that deals withadditional families of tools, whose character prevents a thoroughlysatisfactory service by the current encapsulation method.  We mean toaddress interpretive and query systems, multi-user collaborative andnon-collaborative tools, and programs that allow incremental bindingof parameters after start-up and storing of intermediate and/orpartial results.  Our goal is to support a greater amount ofinteraction between multiple human operators, the tools and theenvironment, in the context of complex software development andmanagement tasks.  During the realization of this project, weintroduced several concepts related to integration of CommercialOff-The-Shelf tools into Software Development Environments: anapproach based on multiple enveloping protocols, a categorization oftools according to their multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities,the ideas of loose wrapping (as opposed to the usual tight wrapping)and of persistent tools (with respect to the duration of a singletask), and a functional extension of some intrinsically single-userapplications to a (limited) form of collaboration.

Kaiser                    1994-01-01                    We present a CASE-tool integration strategy based on envelopingpre-existing tools without source code modifications, recompilation,or assuming an extension language or any other special capabilities onthe part of the tool.  This Black Box enveloping (or wrapping) ideahas been around for a long time, but was previously restricted torelatively simple tools.  We describe the design and implementation ofa new Black Box enveloping facility intended for sophisticated tools--- with particular concern for the emerging class of groupware applications.

Bhat,  Shree K. Nayar                    1994-01-01                    The problem of accurate depth estimation using stereoin the presence of specular reflection is addressed. Specularreflection is viewpoint dependent and can cause large intensitydifferences at corresponding points.Hence, mismatches could result causing significant depth errors.Current stereo algorithms largely ignore specular reflectionwhich is a fundamental reflection phenomenon from surfaces, bothsmooth and rough. We analyzed the physics of specular reflectionand the geometry of stereopsis which led us to an interestingrelationship between stereo vergence, surface roughness, and thelikelihood of a correct match. Given the lower bound onsurface roughness, an optimal binocular stereo configurationcan be determined which maximizes precision in depthestimation despite specular reflection.However, surface roughness is difficult to estimate in unstructured environments. Therefore, multiple view configurations independent of surface roughness are determined such that at each scene point visible to all sensors, at least one stereo pair provides a correct depth estimate. We have developed a simple algorithm to reconstruct depth from the multiple view images. Experiments with real surfaces confirm theviability of our approach. A key feature of this approach is that we do notseek to eliminate or avoid specular reflection, but rather minimize itseffect on stereo matching.

Chan, Salvatore J. Stolfo                    1994-01-01                    Much of the research in inductive learning concentrates on problemswith relatively small amounts of training data.  With the steadyprogress of the Human Genome Project, it is likely that orders ofmagnitude more data in sequence databases will be available in thenear future for various learning problems of biological importance.Thus, techniques that provide the means of {\\it scaling} machinelearning algorithms requires considerable attention.{\\it Meta-learning} is proposed as a general technique to integrate anumber of distinct learning processes that aims to provide a means ofscaling to large problems.  This paper details several meta-learningstrategies for integrating independently learned classifiers onsubsets of training data by the same learner in a parallel anddistributed computing environment.  Our strategies are particularlysuited for massive amounts of data that main-memory-based learningalgorithms cannot handle efficiently.  The strategies are alsoindependent of the particular learning algorithm used and theunderlying parallel and distributed platform.  Preliminary experimentsusing different learning algorithms in a simulated parallelenvironment demonstrate encouraging results: parallel learning bymeta-learning can achieve comparable prediction accuracy in less spaceand time than serial learning.

Cheng,  Luis Plana, Stephen H. Unger                    1994-01-01                    This paper describes a novel algorithm for essential-hazard-free stateminimization of incompletely specified asynchronous sequential machines.Some novel techniques for  elimination and avoidance ofpotential transient and steady state essential hazards under unbounded delay assumption are proposed andexploited in our algorithm.  This paper illustrates that apparent steady stateessential hazards can be removed from a flow table if at least two ofthe rows which contribute to the hazard can be merged. It also showsthat the existing state merging algorithms introduce steady state andtransient essential hazards that can be avoided.  The algorithm hasbeen implemented and applied to over a dozen asynchronous sequentialmachines. Results are compared with results ofnon-essential-hazard-free method SIS.  Most of the tested cases can bereduced to essential hazard free flow tables.

However, this specific task raises a number of difficult issues that are quite distinct from the generic task of language generation: conciseness, complex sentences, floating concepts, historical background, paraphrasing power and implicit content.In this thesis, I address these specific issues by proposing a new generation model in which a first pass builds a draft containing only the essential new facts to report and a second pass incrementally revises this draft to opportunistically add as many background facts as can fit within the space limit. This model requires a new type of linguistic knowledge: revision operations, which specifyies the various ways a draft can be transformed in order to concisely accommodate a new piece of information. I present an in-depth corpus analysis of human-written sports summaries that resultedin an extensive set of such revision operations. I also present the implementation,based on functional unification grammars, of the system STREAK, which relies on these operations to incrementally generate complex sentences summarizing basketball games. This thesis also contains two quantitative evaluations. The first shows that the new revision-based generation model is far more robust than the one-shot model of previous generators. The second evaluation demonstrates that the revision operations acquired during the corpusanalysis and implemented in STREAK are, for the most part, portable to at leastone other quantitative domain (the stock market).STREAK is the first report generator that systematically places the facts whichit summarizes in their historical perspective. It is more concise than previoussystems thanks to its ability to generate more complex sentences and to opportunistically convey facts by adding a few words to carefully chosen draft constituents. The revision operations on which STREAK is based constitute the first set of corpus-based linguistic knowledge geared towards incremental generation. The evaluation presented in this thesis is also the first attempt to quantitatively assess the robustness of a new generation model and the portability of a new type of linguistic knowledge.

MeldC is a C-based, concurrent, object-oriented languagebuilt on a reflective architecture.  The key of the reflective featureis that the metaclass supports  {\\it  shadow}  objects that  implement{\\it secondary behaviors} of objects.  The  behavior of  an object canbe extended by dynamically composing multiple secondary behaviors withthe primary behavior of the object which  is defined by its class. Themechanism  is referred to as  {\\it dynamic composition}.  Our focus isto  study the language architecture with which programmers are able toconstruct -- without modifying the language internals --  new languagefeatures in a high-level  and efficient  way. We demonstrate that theMeldC  reflective  architecture  is  the  right  approach to  buildingdistributed and persistent systems.

Kaiser                    1993-01-01                    Attribute grammars add specification of static semantic properties tocontext-free grammars, which in turn describe the syntactic structureof program units.  However, context-free grammars cannot expressprogramming-in-the-large features common in modern programminglanguages, including unordered collections of units, included unitsand sharing of included units.  We present extensions to context-freegrammars, and corresponding extensions to attribute grammars, suitablefor defining such features.  We explain how batch and incrementalattribute evaluation algorithms can be adapted to support theseextensions, resulting in a uniform approach to intra-unit andinter-unit static semantic analysis and translation of multi-unitprograms.

We developedthree kinds of transitive closure programs, one using a storedprocedure to simulate a built-in transitive closure operator, oneusing the C language embedded with SQL statements to simulate theiterated execution of the transitive closure operation, and one usingFloyd's matrix algorithm to compute the transitive closure of an inputgraph.  By comparing and analyzing the respective performances oftheir different versions in terms of elapsed time spent on taking thetransitive closure, we identify some of the bottlenecks that arisewhen defining the transitive closure operator on top of existingrelational systems. The main purpose of the work is to estimate thecosts of taking transitive closures on top of relational systems,isolate the different cost factors (such as logging, networktransmission cost, etc.), and identify some necessary enhancements toexisting relational systems in order to support transitive closureoperation efficiently.  We argue that relational databases should beaugmented with efficient transitive closure operators if such queriesare made frequently.

Theexpression consists of user-defined regular expressions andpart-of-speech tags.  The purpose of crep is to make the searchesfaster and easier than by either a) searching through corpora by hand;or b) constructing a lexical scanner for each specific search.  crep achieves this facilitation by offering the user a simpleexpression syntax, from which it automatically constructs an appropriate scanner.  The user therefore has the ability to execute a whole search in one command, invoking several modules explicity orimplicitly, including a sentence delimiter, a part-of-speech tagger, an expression matcher, and various output filters.

Kaiser                    1993-01-01                    We survey extended transaction models proposed to support longduration, interactive and/or cooperative activities in the context ofmulti-user software development and CAD/CAM environments.  Many ofthese are variants of the checkout model, which addresses the longduration and interactive nature of the activities supported byenvironments but still isolates environment users so that they cannot(or at least are not supposed to) collaborate while their activitiesare in progress.  However, a few cooperative transaction models havebeen proposed to facilitate collaboration, usually while maintainingsome guarantees of consistency.

Boult\"                    1993-01-01                    The problem considered in this paper is motivated by the independencebetween logical and physical topology in Wavelength DivisionMultiplexing (WDM) based local and metropolitan lightwave networks.  This paper suggests logical embeddings of digraphs into multihop lightwavenetworks to maximize the throughput under nonuniform trafficconditions. Defining {\\it congestion} as the maximum flow carried on any link, twoperturbation heuristics are presented to find a {\\it good logical}embedding on which the routing problem is solved with minimum congestion.  A constructive proof for a lower bound of the problem is given, andobtaining an optimal solution for integral routing is shown to beNP-Complete.   The performance of the heuristics is empirically analyzed on varioustraffic models.  Simulation results show that our heuristics perform, onthe average, $20\\%$ from a computed lower bound. Since this lower bound isnot quite tight, we suspect that the actual performance is better. Inaddition, we show that $5\\% - 20\\%$ performance improvements can beobtained over the previous work.

Werschulz                    1993-01-01                    Previous work on the $\\e$-complexity of elliptic boundary-value problems$Lu=f$ assumed that the class~$F$ of problem elements~$f$ was the unitball of a Sobolev space.  In a recent paper, we considered the caseof a model two-point boundary-value problem,with $F$ being a class of analytic functions.  In this paper, we askwhat happens if $F$ is a class of piecewise analytic functions.  Wefind that the complexity depends strongly on how much a prioriinformation we have about the breakpoints.  If the location of thebreakpoints is known, then the $\\e$-complexity is proportional to$\\ln(\\e^{-1})$, and there is a finite element $p$-method (in the senseof Babu\\u{s}ka) whose cost is optimal to within a constant factor.If we know neither the location nor the number of breakpoints, thenthe problem is unsolvable for $\\e<\\sqrt{2}$.  If we know only thatthere are $b\\ge 2$ breakpoints, but we don't know their location, thenthe $\\e$-complexity is proportional to $b\\e^{-1}$, and a finite element$h$-method is nearly optimal.  In short, knowing the location of thebreakpoints is as good as knowing that the problem elements areanalytic, whereas only knowing the number of breakpoints is no betterthan knowing that the problem elements have a bounded derivative inthe $L_2$ sense.

B\\\"unter\"                    1993-01-01                    Repositories in CASE hold information about the development process and thestructure of developing software. The migration or reuse of CASErepositories for CARE (Computer Aided Re-Engineering) is not adequate for the reengineering process. The main reasons for its inadequacy are the emptyness of such repositories, and the nature of the process itself. In the following report we will define a CARE architecture, from the reengineering point of view, and derive a structure of a repository appropriate to the reengineering process.

B\\\"unter\"                    1993-01-01                    The history of programming is filled with works about the propertiesof program flow graphs. There are many approaches to defining thequality of such graphs, and to improving a given flow graph byrestructuring the underlying source code.  We present here a new,twofold approach to restructuring the control flow of arbitrary sourcecode. The first part of the method is a classical deterministicalgorithm; the second part is non-deterministic and involves userinteraction. The method is based on node splitting, enabling it tosatisfy the definition of the extended Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams.

These  techniques anchor  their  decision-making oncontrol information within transmitted frames and  thus  must  resolveroutes at the speed in which frames are being pumped into switches.Isochronets can potentially  switch at any transmission rate by makingswitching decisions independent of frame contents.  Isochronets dividenetwork  bandwidth among  routing  trees,  a  technique  called  RouteDivision  Multiple  Access (RDMA).   Frames  access  network resourcesthrough  the  appropriate  routing tree  to  the  destination.   Framestructures  are  irrelevant  for  switching  decisions.  Consequently,Isochronets can support multiple framing protocols without  adaptationlayers and are strong candidates for all-optical implementations.  Allnetwork-layer functions  are reduced to an admission control mechanismdesigned  to provide quality of service (QOS) guarantees for  multipleclasses of traffic.The main results of this work are:(1)  A new network architecture suitable for high-speed transmissions;(2)  An  implementation  of  Isochronets  using  cheap   off-the-shelf     components;(3)  A comparison of RDMA  with more traditional switching techniques,     such as Packet Switching and Circuit Switching;(4)  New protocols necessary for Isochronet operations; and(5)  Use  of Isochronet techniques at higher  layers  of  the protocol     stack (in particular, we show how Isochronet techniques may solve     routing problems in ATM networks).

Ben-Shaul, Gail E. Kaiser                    1993-01-01                    This paper describes work-in-progress on a configuration facility fora multi-site software development environment.  The environmentsupports collaboration among geographically-dispersed teams ofsoftware developers.  Addition and deletion of local subenvironmentsites to a global environment is performed interactively inside anyone of the existing local subenvironments, with the same userinterface normally employed for invoking software development tools.This registration process is defined and executed using the samenotation and mechanisms, respectively, as for the software developmentprocess.  Each remote site is represented by a root object in thedistributed objectbase containing the software under development; eachlocal subobjectbase can be displayed and queried at any site, but onlyits root is physically copied at every site.  Everything described inthis paper has been implemented and is working, but since we are inthe midst of experimentation, we do not expect that the ``final''system will be exactly as described here.

This doctoral thesis introduces five example-basedtechniques to facilitate the process. These techniques areindependently useful, but also interrelate in interesting ways:* Graphical Search and Replace, the analogue to textual search andreplace in text editors, is useful for making repetitive changesthroughout graphical documents.* Constraint-Based Search and Replace, an extension to graphicalsearch and replace, allows users to define their own illustrationbeautification rules and constraint inferencing rules bydemonstration.* Constraint Inferencing from Multiple Snapshots facilitatesconstraint specification by automatically computing constraints thathold in multiple configurations of an illustration.* Editable Graphical Histories, a visual representation of commands ina graphical user interface, are useful for reviewing, undoing, andredoing sets of operations.* Graphical Macros By Example, based on this history representation,allow users to scroll through previously executed commands andencapsulate useful sequences into macros. These macros can begeneralized into procedures, with arguments and flow of control usinggraphical and constraint-based search and replace.Individually and in combination, these techniques reduce repetition ingraphical editing tasks, visually and by example, using theapplication's own interface. These techniques have been implemented inChimera, an editor built to serve as a testbed for this research.

Most of them are implemented in kinds of conventional control flow model of execution which is limited by \"von Neumann bottleneck.\" In this paper we propose a new multiprocessor dataflow machine, called DFLOPS, for parallel processingof production systems. The rules programs are compiled into dataflow graphs and then map into DFLOPS processing elements. Our parallel execution model exploits not only matching rules in parallel but also  firing rules in parallel. The design and implementation of  DFLOPS is presented in detail. The distinguishing characteristics of this proposed machine lies in its  simplicity, fully-pipelined processing and  fine grain parallelism. MISD, SIMD and/or MIMD modes of execution can be exploited in this machine according to the properties of applications.The initial results reveal that the performance of production systems isgreatly improved.

Skopp, Gail E. Kaiser                    1993-01-01                    Software Development Environments have traditionally relied upon acentral project database and file repository, accessible to aprogrammer's workstation via a local area network connection.  Theintroduction of powerful mobile computers has demonstrated the needfor a new model, which allows for machines with transient networkconnectivity to assist programmers in product development.  We proposea process-based checkout model by which process and product files thatmay be needed during a planned period of dis-connectivity arepre-fetched with minimal user effort.  Rather than selecting each fileby hand, which is tedious and error-prone, the user only informs theenvironment of the portion of the software development processintended to be executed while disconnected.  The environment is thenresponsible for pre-fetching the necessary files.  We hope that thisapproach will enable programmers to continue working on a projectwithout network access.

They compute subsumptionrelations between concepts and automatically classify concepts into ataxonomy having well-founded semantics.  Each concept in the taxonomydescribes a set of possible instances which are a superset of thosedescribed by its descendants.  One limitation of current systems is theirinability to handle complex compositions of concepts, such as constraintnetworks where each node is described by an associated concept.  Forexample, plans are often represented (in part) as collections of actionsrelated by a rich variety of temporal and other constraints.  The T-REXsystem integrates terminological reasoning with constraint networkreasoning to classify such plans, producing a ``terminological'' planlibrary.  T-REX also introduces a new theory of plan recognition as adeductive process which dynamically partitions the plan library bymodalities, e.g., necessary, possible and impossible, while observationsare made.  Plan recognition is guided by the plan library's terminologicalnature.  Varying assumptions about the accuracy and monotonicity of theobservations are addressed.  Although this work focuses on temporalconstraint networks used to represent plans, terminological systems can beextended to encompass constraint networks in other domains as well.

A similarmechanism, with added complications, is shown to characterize criticalraces.  Means for defeating various types of hazards and criticalraces through the use of one-sided delay constraints are introduced.A method is described for determining from a flow table situations inwhich metastable states may be entered.  A circuit technique fordefeating metastability problems in self timed systems is presented.It is shown that the use of simulation for verifying the correctnessof a circuit with given bounds on the branch delays cannot be reliedupon to expose all timing problems. An example is presented thatrefutes the conjecture that replacing pure delays with inertial delayscan only eliminate glitches.

This can cause unnecessary computation overheadwhile executing a rule.

The bounds are expressed in termsof the entropy of the probability distribution,the number of elements and the probabilitythat a search is successfully.Most of our lower bounds are derived by means of a new techniquewhich exploits the relation between trees and codes.Our lower bounds compare favorably with known limitations.We also provide an achievable upper bound on the Kraft sumgeneralized to the internal nodes of a tree.

In this paper we consider linear arrays of processing elements,with unidirectional bypass links of length $g$.We count the number of particular sets of faultyprocessing elements. We show thatthe number of catastrophic faults of $g$ elementsis equal to the $(g-1)$-th Catalan number.We also provide algorithms to rank and unrank all catastrophic sets of $g$ faults.Finally, we describe a linear time algorithm that generates all such sets of faults.

Ulam, in his autobiography (1976), suggestedan interesting two--person search game which can be formalized as follows:a Responder chooses an element $x$ in $\\{ 1,2,\\ldots,1000000 \\}$unknown to a Questioner. The Questioner has to findit by asking queries of the form ``$x \\in Q ?$\", where $Q$ is anarbitrary subset of $\\{ 1,2,\\ldots, 1000000 \\}$. The Responder provides``yes\" or ``no\" answers, some of which may be {\\it erroneous }.In this paper we determine the minimal number of yes-no queries needed to findthe unknown integer $x$ between $1$ and $1000000$ if at most four of theanswers may be erroneous.

Skopp                    1993-01-01                    Software Development Environments have traditionally relied upon acentral project database and file repository, accessible to aprogrammer's workstation via a high speed local area networkconnection.  The introduction of powerful mobile computers hasdemonstrated the need for a new model, which allows for variablebandwidth machines as well as transient network connectivity to assistprogrammers in product development.  A new client-server model isintroduced which minimizes network traffic when bandwidth is limited.To support disconnected operation, I propose a em process-basedcheckout model by which process information and product files that maybe needed during a planned period of dis-connectivity are pre-fetchedwith minimal user effort.  Rather than selecting each file by hand,which is tedious and error-prone, the user only informs theenvironment of the portion of the software development processintended to be executed while disconnected.  The environment is thenresponsible for pre-fetching the necessary files.  It is hoped thatthese research efforts will enable programmers to continue working ona project without continuous high speed network access.

Heineman                    1993-01-01                    This paper demonstrates that the enaction of a software process canbe separated from the formalism in which the process is modeled.To show this, we built a compiler capable of automaticallytranslating a process model specified using Statemate into a MARVELenvironment which then supports the enaction of the process.

Schilit, Dan Duchamp                    1991-01-01                    There is a strong trend toward the production of small ``notebook''\rcomputers.  The small size of portable computers places inherent\rlimits on their storage capacity, making remote paging desirable or\rnecessary.  Further, mobile computers can ``walk away from'' their\rservers, increasing load on network routing resources and/or breaking\rnetwork connections altogether.  Therefore, it is desirable to allow\rclient-server matchups to be made dynamically and to vary over time,\rso that a client might always be connected to nearby servers.\rAccordingly, we have built a self-organizing paging service that\radapts to changes in locale and that stores pages in remote memory if\rpossible.  We show empirically that there is no performance penalty\rfor using our paging facility instead of a local disk.  This suggests\rthat portable computers need neither a hard disk nor an excessive\ramount of RAM, provided that they will operate in environments in\rwhich remote storage is plentiful.  These are important facts because\rboth a hard disk and large amounts of RAM are undesirable\rcharacteristics for very small portable computers.

Maguire Jr.                    1991-01-01                    We consider the problem of providing network access to hosts whosephysical location changes with time. Such hosts cannot depend ontraditional forms of network connectivity and routing because theirlocation, and hence the route to reach them, cannot be deduced fromtheir IP address. We present protocols that seamlessly integratemobile hosts into the current IP networking infrastructure. They areprimarily targeted at supporting a campus environment with mobilecomputers, but also extend gracefully to accomodate hosts movingbetween different networks. The key feature is the dependence onancillary machines to track the location of the mobile hosts.  Ourprotocols are designed to react quickly to changing topologies, toscale well, and not to place an overwhelming burden on the network.

However, the difficulty of specify-ingconstraints by traditional methods forms a barrier to their widespreaduse. In order to make constraints easier to declare, we have developeda method of specifying constraints implicitly, through multipleexamples. Snapshots are taken of an initial scene configuration, andone or more additional snapshots are taken after the scene has beenedited into other valid configurations. The constraints that aresatisfied in all the snapshots are then applied to the scene objects.We discuss an efficient algorithm for inferring constraints frommultiple snapshots. The algorithm has been incorporated into theChimera editor, and several examples of its use are discussed.

One of the major objectives of thisresearch is to invoke external tools to carry out steps in a softwareprocess without modifying the tools. This is achieved by encapsulatingtools in {\\it envelopes}, designed to abstract the details of a toolfrom the {\\sc Marvel} kernel, thereby providing a ``black box''interface.  Initially we used the {\\sc Unix} shell script language towrite envelopes.  However, due to several limitations of the shelllanguage the black box abstraction could not be fully supported.  Wedescribe these limitations and discuss how we extended the shelllanguage to obtain a new envelope language that fully supports theblack box abstraction.

Italiano                    1991-01-01                    We study the problem of maintaining the 2-edge-connected components ofa graph undergoing repeated dynamic modifications, such as edgeinsertions and edge deletions.  We show how to test at any timewhether two vertices belong to the same 2-edge-connected component,and how to insert and delete an edge in $O(m^{2/3})$ time in the worstcase, where $m$ is the current number of edges in the graph. Thisanswers a question posed by Westbrook and Tarjan [WT89].  Forplanar graphs, we present algorithms that support all these operationsin $O(\\sqrt{n\\log\\log n}\\,)$ worst-case time each, where $n$ is thetotal number of vertices in the graph.

These components are abstracted as objects and storedin a persistent object database.  Each rule applies to a specific class ofobjects, which is specified as the parameter of the rule.  Firing a ruleentails binding its formal parameter to a specific object. If the rulechanges the object in such a way that the conditions of other rules becomesatisfied, these other rules are automatically fired.  A problem arises inthis forward chaining model when the classes of the objects manipulated bythe rules are different.  {\\sc Marvel} has to determine which object tobind to the parameter of each rule in the chain, based on the objectmanipulated by the original rule that initiated the chain.  We describe aheuristic approach for solving this problem in the current {\\sc Marvel}implementation and introduce an algorithmic approach that does better.

Solutions to these problemsmake it possible to construct semantics-based editors for use by teamsof programmers developing or maintaining large software systems.Multi-user semantics-based editors improve software productivity byreducing communication costs and snafus.The objectives of an incremental attribute evaluation algorithm formultiple asynchronous changes are that (a) all attributes of thederivation tree have correct values when evaluation terminates, and(b) the cost of evaluating attributes necessary to reestablish acorrectly attributed derivation tree is minimized.  We present a familyof algorithms that differ in how they balance the tradeoff betweenalgorithm efficiency and expressiveness of the attribute grammar.This is important because multi-user editors seem a practical basisfor many areas of computer-supported cooperative work, not justprogramming.  Different application areas may have distinctdefinitions of efficiency, and may impose different requirements onthe expressiveness of the attribute grammar.  The characteristics ofthe application domain can then be used to select the most efficientstrategy for each particular editor.To address the second problem, we define an extension of classicalattribute grammars that allows the specification of interfaceconsistency checking for programs composed of many modules. Classicalattribute grammars can specify the static semantics of monolithic programs ormodules, but not inter-module semantics; the latter was done in thepast using @i[ad hoc] techniques.  Extended attribute grammars support programming-in-the-large constructs found in real programminglanguages, including textual inclusion, multiple kinds of modularunits and nested modular units.  We discuss attribute evaluation in thecontext of programming-in-the-large, particularly the separation ofconcerns between the local evaluator for each modular unit and theglobal evaluator that propagates attribute flows across moduleboundaries. The result is a uniform approach to formal specificationof both intra-module and inter-module static semantic properties, withthe ability to use attribute evaluation algorithms to carry out acomplete static semantic analysis of a multi-module program.

Popovich                    1991-01-01                    Much research has been done in the last decade in the closely relatedareas of object-oriented programming languages and databases.  Bothareas now seem to be working toward a common end, that of an @i(objectmanagement system), or OMS.  An OMS is constructed similarly to anOODB but provides a general purpose concurrent object orientedprogramming language as well, sharing the object base with the OODBquery facilities.  In this paper, we will define several differenttypes of object systems (object servers, persistent OOPL's, OODB's andOMS's) in terms of their interfaces and capabilities.  We will examinethe distinguishing features and general architecture of systems ofeach type in the light of a general model of OMS architecture.

Theresult is an elegant declarative control language for multi-usersoftware processes, with data and activities defined as classes andrules in the previously existing {\\sc Marvel} Strategy Language.Semantics-based concurrency control is provided by a combination ofthe {\\sc Marvel} kernel's lock and transaction managers and the send/receivesynchronization primitives of the activity structures model.

Tait, Dan Duchamp                    1991-01-01                    Portable computers are now common, a fact that raises the possibilitythat file service clients might move on a regular basis.  This newdevelopment requires re-thinking some features of distributed filesystem design.  We argue that existing approaches to file replicamanagement would not cope well with the likely behavior of mobileclients, and we present our solution: a lazy ``server-based'' updateoperation.  This operation facilitates fast, scalable, and highlyfault-tolerant implementations of both read and write operations inthe usual case.  To cope with the weak semantics of the updateoperation, we propose a new file system service interface that allowsapplications to opt for ``UNIX semantics'' by use of a slower, lessfault-tolerant read operation.

Kaiser                    1991-01-01                    Distributed applications ideally allow reconfiguration while theapplication is running, but changes are usually limited to adding newclient and server processes and changing the bindings among suchprocesses.  In some application domains, such as real-time financialservices, it is necessary to support finer grained reconfiguration atthe level of entities smaller than processes, but desirable to reducethe overhead associated with ad hoc dynamic storage allocation.  Wepresent a scheme for special cases of fine-grained dynamicreconfiguration sufficient for our application domain and show how itcan be used for practical changes.  We introduce new language conceptsto apply this scheme in the context of an object-based programminglanguage that supports shared data in a distributed environment.

Patel                    1991-01-01                    Voluminous amounts of rapidly changing data in financial marketscreate a challenging problem for portfolio managers attempting toexploit such changes to achieve their investment objectives.  TheSPLENDORS real time portfolio management system, built using thePROFIT language, is such a system.Changes in security prices are monitored in a real-time fashion andindividual portfolios can be optimized by taking advantage of thesechanges within the constraints imposed by the investment philosophy ofthe investor.SPLENDORS allows great flexibility in creating portfolio managers forthe sophisticated C programmer and considerable ease of programmingfor the PROFIT programmer.

Devanbu, Diane J. Litman                    1991-01-01                    CLASP (ClAssification of Scenarios and Plans) is a knowledge representationsystem that extends the notion of subsumption from frame-based languages toplans.  The CLASP representation language provides description formingoperators that specify temporal and conditional relationships between actionsrepresented in CLASSIC (a current subsumption-based knowledge representationlanguage).  CLASP supports subsumption inferences between plan concepts andother plan concepts, as well as between plan concepts and plan instances. These inferences support the automatic creation of a plan taxonomy. Subsumption in CLASP builds on term subsumption in CLASSIC and illustrateshow term subsumption can be exploited to serve special needs.  In particular,the CLASP algorithms for plan subsumption integrate work in automata theorywith work in term subsumption.  We are using CLASP to store and retrieveinformation about feature specifications and test scripts in the context of alarge software development project.

Theprogram is composed of two main modules: a unifier and a linearizer. Theunifier takes as input a semantic description of the text to be generatedand a unification grammar, and produces as output a rich syntacticdescription of the text. The linearizer interprets this syntacticdescription and produces an English sentence. This manual includes a detailed presentation of the technique ofunification grammars and a reference manual for the current implementation(FUF 5.0).  Version 5.0 now includes novel techniques in the unificationallowing the specification of types and the expression of completeinformation.  It also allows for procedural unification and supportssophisticated forms of control.

For example, @i(now) maysignal the beginning of a subtopic or a return to a previous topic, while@i(well) may mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as anexplanatory comment.  However, while cue phrases @b(may) convey discoursestructure, each also has one or more alternate uses.  While @i(incidentally) maybe used @b(SENTENTIALLY) as an adverbial, for example, the @b(DISCOURSE) useinitiates a digression.  The question of how speakers and hearers distinguishbetween discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is rarely addressed indiscourse studies.This paper reports results of several empirical studies of discourse andsentential uses of cue phrases, in which both text-based and prosodicfeatures were examined for disambiguating power.  Based on these studies, wepropose that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished byintonational features, specifically, @b(PITCH) @b(ACCENT) and @b(INTONATIONAL)@b(PHRASING).  We identify a prosodic model that characterizes thesedistinctions.  We associate this model with features identifiable from textanalysis, including orthography and part-of-speech, to permit the applicationof our findings to the generation of appropriate intonational features fordiscourse and sentential uses of cue phrases in synthetic speech.

Galil, K. Park                    1991-01-01                    We study the parallel computation of dynamic programming.There are five important dynamic programming problems whichhave wide application, and that have been studied extensivelyin sequential computation.  Two problems among the five havefast parallel algorithms; almost no work has been done forparallelizing the other three.  We give fast parallel algorithmsfor four of these problems, including the three.We use two well-known methods as general paradigms for developingparallel algorithms.  Combined with various techniques, theylead to a number of new results.  At the heart of our new resultsis a processor reduction technique, which enables us to solveall four problems with a fewer number of operations than thatneeded for computing a matrix closure.

Chan                    1991-01-01                    To investigate how human characteristics are inherited, molecularbiologists have been analyzing chemical sequences from DNA, RNA, andproteins.  To facilitate this process, sequence analysis knowledge hasbeen encoded in computer programs.  However, translating humanknowledge to programs is known to be problematic.  Machine Learningtechniques allow these systems to be generated automatically.  Thisarticle discusses the application of learning techniques to variousanalysis tasks.  It is shown that the learned systems constructed todate are often more accurate than human-designed systems.  Moreover,learning can form plausible new hypotheses, which potentially lead todiscovering new knowledge.

ESR allows some limited amount of inconsistencyin transaction processing (TP), through an interface calledepsilon-transactions (ETs).  For example, some query ETs may viewinconsistent data due to non-SR interleaving with concurrent updates.In this paper, we restrict our attention to the situation wherequery-only ETs run concurrently with {\\em consistent} updatetransactions that are SR without the ETs.This paper presents a {\\em formal characterization} of ESR and ETs.Using the ACTA framework, the first part of this characterizationformally expresses the inter-transaction conflicts that are recognizedby ESR and, through that, defines ESR, analogous to the manner inwhich conflict-based serializability is defined.  The second part ofthe paper is devoted to deriving expressions for: (1) the {\\eminconsistency} in the values of data -- arising from ongoing updates,(2) the inconsistency of the results of a query -- arising from theinconsistency of the data read in order to process the query, and (3)the inconsistency exported by an update ET -- arising from ongoingqueries reading uncommitted data produced by the update ET.  Theseexpressions are used to determine the preconditions that ET operationshave to satisfy in order to maintain the limits on the inconsistencyin the data read by query ETs, the inconsistency exported by updateETs, and the inconsistency in the results of queries.  Thisdetermination suggests possible mechanisms that can be used to realizeESR.

Weida                    1991-01-01                    We provide a detailed overview of knowledge representation issues ingeneral and terminological knowledge representation in particular.Terminological knowledge representation, which originated with KL-ONE, is an object-centered approach in the tradition of semantic networks andframes.  Terminological systems share three distinguishing characteristics:(1) They are intended to support the definition of conceptual termscomprising a \"terminology\" and to facilitate reasoning about such terms.As such, they are explicitly distinguished from assertional systems whichmake statements of fact based on some terminology.  (2) Their concepts arearranged in a taxonomy so that the attributes of a concept apply to itsdescendants without exception.  Thus, the proper location of any conceptwithin the taxonomy can be uniquely determined from the concept'sdefinition by an automatic process known as classification.  (3) Theyrestrict the expressiveness of their language to achieve relativelyefficient performance.We first survey important general issues in the field of knowledgerepresentation, consider the semantics of concepts and theirinterrelationship, and examine the intertwined notions of taxonomy andinheritance.  After discussing classification, we present a number ofimplemented terminological systems in detail, along with several hybridsystems which couple terminological and assertional reasoning components.We conclude by assessing the current state of the art in terminologicalknowledge representation.

Kaiser                    1990-01-01                    The authors have previously described the use of data path expressionsand predecessor  automata  in  debugging concurrent systems.  In  thispaper we examine  the relationship of these  models to two traditionalmodels of concurrent processes:  pomset languages and k-safe Petri netsystems.  We  explore the  regularity  and   safety of  the concurrentlanguages described by each of the four models.

We first define lexical choice as the choice of {\\em open-class}lexical items (whether phrasal patterns or individual words) appropriate toexpress the content units of the utterance to generate in a given situationof enunciation. We then distinguish between five major classes ofconstraints on lexical choice: grammatical, inter-lexical, encyclopedic,interpersonal and discursive. For each class we review how they have beenrepresented and used in existing generators. We conclude by pointing outthe common limitations of these generators with respect to lexical choiceas well as some directions for future research in the field.

We describe a new testing method for object-orientedprograms that specifically exploits encapsulation properties.Individual object classes or even individual instances of objects maybe instrumented for testing.  At the heart of the method is thesystematic renaming and duplication of object classes.

We believe that portableworkstation-class machines connected by wireless networks anddependent on a computational and informational infrastructure raise anumber of important issues in operating systems and distributedcomputation (e.g., the partitioning of tasks between workstations andinfrastructure), and therefore the development of such machines andtheir software is important.

Maguire Jr.                    1990-01-01                    Coherent TFTP is a protocol that takes advantage of the broadcastnature of CSMA networks to speed up simultaneous one-to-many filetransfers (e.g., when booting diskless workstations). The CTFTP serverlisens and services request for entire files or portions thereof.CTFTP clients first determine whether the file they are interested inis already being transferred, in which case they ``eavesdrop'' andload as much of it as they can, or they initiate a new transfer. Theclients timeout when the server stops transmitting, and if they arestill missing parts of the file they request them with ablock-transfer request. CTFTP is a back-end protocol; a front end isneeded to handle naming and security issues.

Korz, Robert C. Lehman                    1990-01-01                    Measuring the performance of applications running over live wide areanetworks such as the Internet is difficult.  Many of the importantvariables (path, network load, etc) cannot be controlled.  Monitoringthe entire Internet to follow individual messages is impractical.  Wedeveloped the Layered Refinement methodology to meet these challenges.Our method uses generic software tools to collect data simultaneouslyat important software layers.  Data are analyzed and refined to reducevariance, and correlated to give us a good understanding of eachlayer.  Sample data spanning seven days illustrate the method, whichnarrows the confidence interval by an order of magnitude to show theend-to-end performance of applications that run over Internet.

It is important todetermine the entire admissible domain of sensor locations,orientations, and settings for each task constraint, so that thesecomponent results can be combined in order to find globally admissiblesensor parameter values.  This work is part of more extensive researchthat we are pursuing, as part of our \"MVP\" (Machine Vision Planner)system, on the problem of sensor planning for satisfaction of severalge neric machine vision requirements.  When designing a vision systemthat will satisfy the requirements of the machine vision task at hand,it is necessary to properly select the specifications of the imagesensor (e.g.  pixel size), as well as decide the image sensorplacement and settings. We present techniques to determine the lattertwo using a synthesis approach to the problem.  This approach providessignificant advantages over the generate-and-test techniques currentlyemployed, in which, sensor configurations are generated and thentested for satisfaction of the task criteria.  Compared to theprevious papers we published on \"MVP\", the new results presented inthis paper include techniques and implementation for determining theconstraint satisfaction loci when all degrees of freedom of cameraplacement are taken into account; obtaining globally feasible sensorconfigurations by posing the constraint satisfaction problem in anoptimization setting; analyzing and formulating a new constraint, thatof depth-of-field, for the determination of sensor placement andsetting that satisfy this constraint; providing a more efficientapproach to the visibility constraint; plus presenting the new testresults of the above mentioned techniques.  Camera placementexperiments are shown that demonstrate the method in an actual roboticsetup for a general three-dimensional viewing configuration.  A cameramounted on a robotic arm is placed and set according to the results ofthe new technique and camera views are taken to verify that thefeatures of interest are visible, within the camera field-of-view anddepth-of-field, and resolvable to the given specification.  Results ofthis research will help automate the vision system design process,assist in programming the vision system itself and lead to intelligentautomated robot imaging systems.

Barghouti, Gail E. Kaiser                    1990-01-01                    Rule-based development environments (RBDEs) model the softwaredevelopment process in terms of rules that encapsulate developmentactivities, and execute forward and backward chaining on the rules toprovide assistance in carrying out the development process. Weinvestigate the scaling up of RBDEs along two dimensions.  The firstdimension covers the nature of the assistance provided by the RBDE,and the second spans the functionality.  There is a spectrum ofassistance models implemented by RBDEs.  We consider three models:pure automation, strict consistency preservation, and a maximalistassistance model that integrates consistency and automation.  Thechoice of assistance model impacts the functionality of the RBDE, moreprecisely the solutions to three problems that arise in scaling upRBDEs: (1) multiple views; (2) evolution; and (3) concurrency control.We explore the solutions to the three problems with respect to each ofthe three assistance models.  Throughout the paper, we use the MarvelRBDE as an example.

Maarek, Daniel M. Berry, Gail E. Kaiser                    1990-01-01                    Although software reuse presents clear advantages for programmerproductivity and code reliability, it is not practiced enough.  One ofthe reasons for the only moderate success of reuse is the lack ofsoftware libraries that facilitate the actual locating andunderstanding of reusable components.  This paper describes a technologyfor automatically assembling large software libraries thatpromote software reuse by helping the user locate the componentsclosest to her/his needs.Software libraries are automatically assembled from a set ofunorganized components by using information retrieval techniques.The construction of the library is done in two steps.  First,attributes are automatically extracted from natural languagedocumentation by using a new indexing scheme based on the notions oflexical affinities and quantity of information.  Then, a hierarchy forbrowsing is automatically generated using a clustering technique thatdraws only on the information provided by the attributes.  Thanks tothe free-text indexing scheme, tools following this  approach canaccept free-style natural  language queries.This technology has been implemented in the {\\sc Guru} system, which hasbeen applied to construct an organized library of {\\sc Aix} utilities. An experiment was  conducted  in order to evaluate the retrievaleffectiveness of{\\sc Guru} as compared to {\\sc InfoExplorer} a hypertext librarysystem for {\\sc Aix} 3 on the IBM RISC System/6000 series. We followed theusual evaluation procedure used in information retrieval, based uponrecall and precision measures, and determined that our systemperforms 15\\% better on a random test set,  while being much lessexpensive to build than {\\sc InfoExplorer                                                                                         (pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Detection and Exploitation of File Working Sets                                        Carl Tait, Dan Duchamp                    1990-01-01                    The work habits of most individuals yield file access patterns thatare quite pronounced and can be regarded as defining working sets offiles used for particular applications.  This paper describes aclient-side cache management technique for detecting these patternsand then exploiting them to successfully prefetch files from servers.Trace-driven simulations show the technique substantially increasesthe hit rate of a client file cache in an environment in which aclient workstation is dedicated to a single user.  Successful fileprefetching carries three major advantages: (1) applications runfaster, (2) there is less ``burst'' load placed on the network, and(3) properly-loaded client caches can better survive network outages.Our technique requires little extra code, and DASH because it issimply an augmentation of the standard LRU client cache managementalgorithm DASH is easily incorporated into existing software.

ESR converges to serializability (SR) when the database reachsa quiescent state, i.e., all the update messages are processed.Divergence control methods make ESR practical by restricting thetemporary inconsistency in the database.  ESR is useful since itallows more concurrency than SR and can be integrated with SR.

The algorithm isadaptive in the sense that the replication scheme of the item (i.e.the set of processors, each of which stores a replica of thedata-item), changes as the read-write pattern of the processors in thenetwork changes.  The algorithm is optimal in the sense that when thereplication scheme stabilizes, the total number of messages requiredfor the reads and writes is minimal.  The algorithm is extremelysimple.

We present an algorithm for incremental maintenance of the inference database in the presence of such updates.Interestingly, the same algorithm is useful for parallel and distributedrule processing. When the processors evaluating a program operateasynchronously, then they may have different {\\em views} of the database.The incremental maintenance procedure we present can be used tosynchronize these views.

First is to propose new databaselanguage features for systems used in real time management.  Thesefeatures enable the specification of change-traces, events andcorrelation among events, and they do so in a declarative set-orientedfashion.  Second is to introduce network management as an importantand interesting application of active distributed databases.

Passonneau                    1990-01-01                    The present work investigates the contrastive discourse functions of adefinite and a demonstrative pronoun in similar contexts of use.  Itthus provides an opportunity to examine the separate contributions toattentional state [15] of two linguistic features---definiteness anddemonstrativity---independently of pronominalization per se.  The twopronouns, \"it\" and \"that\", have clearly contrastive contexts of use,explained here in terms of distinct pragmatic functions.  Certain usesof \"it\" are claimed to perform a distinctive cohesive function, namelyto establish a \"local center\" (which modifies rather than replacesthe notion of a center).  The crucial distinction between a localcenter and the Cb of the centering framework (cf. [38] [13] [14] [21])is that there is only a single potential local center rather than anordered set of Cfs.  The local center is argued to constitute areference point in the model of the speech situation in a manneranalogous to 1st and 2nd person pronouns.  In contrast, a deicticfunction is posited for apparently anaphoric uses of \"that\" wherebythe attentional status of a discourse entity is changed, or a newdiscourse entity is constructed based on non-referential constituentsof the linguistic structure.  Since it is impossible to observeattentional processes directly, I present an empirical method forinvestigating discourse coherence relations. I analyze statisticallysignificant distributional models in terms of three types oftransitions in the cognitive states of conversational participants:expected transitions, unexpected transitions, and transitions with norelevant effect.

Italiano, Alberto Marchetti Spaccamela, Umberto Nanni                    1990-01-01                    We consider the problem of maintaining on-line a solution to the AllPairs Shortest Paths Problem in a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where edgesmay be dynamically inserted or have their cost decreased.  For thecase of integer edge costs in a given range $[1\\ldots C]$, weintroduce a new data structure which is able to answer queriesconcerning the length of the shortest path between any two vertices inconstant time, and to trace out the shortest path between any twovertices in time linear in the number of edges reported.  The totaltime required to maintain the data structure under a sequence of atmost $O(n^2)$ edge insertions and at most $O(Cn^2)$ edge costdecreases is $O(Cn^3\\log (nC))$ in the worst case, where $n$ is thetotal number of vertices in $G$.  For the case of unit edge costs, thetotal time required to maintain the data structure under a sequence ofat most $O(n^2)$ insertions of edges becomes $O(n^3\\log n)$ in theworst case.  Both data structures can be adapted to solve the problemof maintaining on-line maximal length paths in directed acyclicgraphs. All our algorithms improve on previously known algorithms andare only a logarithmic factor away from the best possible bounds.

Three main points   are advanced:  (1)  Previousdiscourse determines the form and content of a new turn; this work proposestechniques to take the influence  of  previous  discourse into account whengenerating text. (2) The connection  between previous discourse and  a  newturn can be described  as the interaction  between five  local constraints;local  constraints are   relations between one   discourse segment  of  theprevious discourse and the new turn.  This multi-dimensional description ofdiscursive  relations  allows a   flexible definition of complex rhetoricalrelations.  (3) Argumentation is one  class of local constraints  which hasimportant  effects  on the form   of the language  produced   and interactsclosely with the other types of local constraints used in this work.The problem of generating a turn is then posed as  the problem of finding aset of local  constraints  compatible with each  other,  with the  previousdiscourse,  and with the information  to  convey.   The  application of thelocal constraints  determines  the value of pragmatic  features of  the newturn.  A  sophisticated grammar   can then translate these  decisions  intoappropriate lexical and syntactic decisions.The approach is applied to the implementation  of an explanation module forthe {\\sc ADVISOR} expert system.  The  implementation is based on an extendedform  of functional unification; this  extended formalism  is a good choicefor handling the problem of constraint interaction.

Instead of generating text based solely oneither discourse goals, intentions, or the domain, we found aneed to combine techniques from each.  We have developed an object-oriented architecture in which the concepts about which we talk(domain entities), the goals that may be accomplished with them(intentions), and the rhetorical acts through which we express them(discourse goals) are represented as objects with localized knowledgeand methods. A three stage process of content selection, contentstructuring and content filtering is presented. Content selection andstructuring allow us to produce text that is within the context of thetask at hand for the user.  Content filtering allows us to revise andrestructure the utterance to achieve clarity and conciseness.

We define the concept of ``program decomposability'', which means that the load of evaluation can be partitioned among a number ofprocessors, without a need for communication among them.  This in turnresults in a very significant speed-up of the evaluation process.Some programs are decomposable, whereas others are not.  We completelysyntactically characterize three classes of single rule programs withrespect to decomposability: nonrecursive, simple linear, and simplechain programs.  We also establish two sufficient conditions fordecomposability.

Wu, Gail E. Kaiser                    1990-01-01                    A {\\it consistency constraint} exists between two objects in a network {\\it management information base (MIB)} if a change in value of one object will cause a change in another.  Based on the definition of {\\it commonknowledge} by Halpern, Fagin, and Moses, such constraints canbe classified by the time needed to maintain them and the probabilityof correctly maintaining them. In this paper, we study the practicalissues of how to build an MIB with a set ofobjects and consistency constraints. We will go through an experimental MIBexample showing that distributed network entities can be consistentlymanaged in an elegant way, even when the network environment is very dynamic.

The high performance networks in many large distributed systems enable a machine to reach the main memory of other nodes faster than local disks.  Thus we introduce {\\em remote memory} as an additional layer in the memory hierarchy between local memory anddisks.  Exploiting the remote memory (every node's cache) improves performance and increases availability.  We have created a simulation program that shows this significant advantage over a wide range ofcache sizes and compares the effects of several object replacement policies in the symmetric distributed main memory database.

We argue that the appropriate parallelization strategy for logic-program evaluation depends on the program being evaluated. Therefore, this paper is concerned with the issues of program-classification, and parallelization-strategies.  We propose several parallelization strategies based on the concept of data-reduction -- the original logic-program is evaluated by several processors working in parallel, each using only a subset of the database.  The strategies differ on the evaluation cost, the overhead of communication and synchronization among processors, and the programs to which they are applicable.  Inparticular, we start our study with pure-parallelization, i.e., parallelization without overhead. An interesting class-structure of logic programs is demonstrated, when considering amenability to pure-parallelization.  The relationship to the NC complexity class is demonstrated.  Then we propose strategies that do incur an overhead,but are optimal in a sense that will be precisely defined. This paper makes the initial steps towards a theory of parallel logic-programming.

The high performance networks in many large distributedsystems enable a machine to reach the main memory of other nodes morequickly than the time to access local disks.  We therefore introduce{\\em remote memory} as an additional layer in the memory hierarchybetween local memory and disks.  In order to appreciate the tradeoffsof memory and cpu in the symmetric architecture, we compare systemperformance in alternative architectures.  Simulations show that, byexploiting remote memory (in each node's cache), performance improvesover a wide range of cache sizes as compared to a distributedclient/server architecture.  We also compare the symmetric model to acentralized-server model and parameterize the performance tradeoffs.

RBDEs storethe software artifacts in a project database, and define each softwaredevelopment activity that manipulates these artifacts as a rule.Opportunistic forward and backward chaining on the rules automatessome of chores that developers would have otherwise done manually andensures consistency in the database.  Existing RBDEs do not scale upto real software development projects involving large teams ofdevelopers, in part because the current expert system paradigm doesnot handle multiple agents sharing the working memory of the rulesystem. In this article, we investigate the scalingup of RBDEs through the use of an object-oriented framework thatintegrates the structural and behavioral aspects of data modeling andrule-based process modeling.

Kender, Il-Pyung Park, David Yang                    1990-01-01                    In this paper we formalize and implement a model of topologicalvisual navigation in two-dimensional spaces.  Unlike much oftraditional quantitative visual navigation, the emphasis throughoutis on the methods and the efficiency of qualitative visualdescriptions of objects and environments, and on the methods and theefficiency of direction-giving by means of visual landmarks.  Weformalize three domains--the world itself, the map-maker's view ofit, and the navigator's experience of it--and the concepts of custommaps and landmarks.  We specify, for a simplified navigator (the``level helicopter'') the several ways in which visual landmarkscan be chosen, depending on which of several costs (sensor, distance,or communication) should be minimized.  We show that paths minimizingone measure can make others arbitrarily complex; the algorithm forselecting the path is based on a form of Dijkstra's algorithm, andtherefore automatically generates intelligent navigator overshooting andbacktracking.  We implement, using an arm-held camera, such anavigator, and detail its basic seek-and-adjust behaviors as itfollows visual highways (or departs from them) to reach a goal.Seeking is based on topology, and adjusting is based on symmetry; there areessentially no quantitative measures.  We describe under whatcircumstances its environment is visually difficult and perceptivelyshadowed, and describe how errors in path-following impact landmarkselection.  Since visual landmark selection and direction-giving arein general NP-complete, and rely on the nearly intractable concept ofcharacteristic views, we suggest some heuristics; one is that thelandmark object ``itself'', rather than its views, may be its mostcompact encoding.  We conclude with speculations about the feasibilityof intelligent navigation in very large self-occluding visual worlds.

For a vector ${\\bf b}$ and for a general $p\\times q$matrix $A$ (with $p + q \\le n$), we compute $A^+$ and $A^+ {\\bf b}$ byusing $O(\\log^2 n)$ parallel arithmetic steps and $n^{2.851}$processors, and we may also compute $A^+{\\bf b}$ by usingO$(n^{2.376})$ arithmetic operations.

We compute $p(\\lambda)=\\det(A-\\lambda I)$, as well as $p(\\lambda)/p'(\\lambda)$, where$p'(\\lambda)$ is the first derivative of $p(\\lambda)$, by using$O(k\\log k\\log n)$ arithmetic operations. Moreover, if $a_i$ are$m\\times m$ matrices, so that $A$ is a banded Toeplitz block matrix,then we compute $p(\\lambda)$, as well as $p(\\lambda)/p'(\\lambda)$, byusing $O(m^3k(\\log^2k+\\log n)+ m^2k\\log k\\log n)$ arithmeticoperations. The algorithms can be extended to the computation of$\\det(A-\\lambda B)$ and of its first derivative, where both $A$ and$B$ are banded Toeplitz matrices. The algorithms may be used as abasis for iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem for the matrix$A$ and of the generalized eigenvalue problem for $A$ and $B$.

This is similar to the more complicated algorithms of[BOT] and [BFKT] that compute such interleaving sets and splittingpoints for the set of the zeros of a polynomial $p(\\lambda)$ havingonly real zeros. As a result, the record upper estimates for theparallel and sequential complexity of approximating to all the zerosof such a polynomial are obtained in an alternate way and, moreover,are extended to the eigenvalue computation for $T_n$. Furthermore, wedramatically decreased the previous record upper estimates for theparallel complexity of the latter problem, to the level withinpolylogarithmic factors from the straightforward lower bounds.

The estimates for the storage space, sequential time and the number of processors required for the computation and storage of such a recursive factorization is by almost the factor of $n$ less than the similar estimates for the Choleski factorization in the case of Toeplitz-like and Hankel-like matrices.

We then classify SDEs in terms ofthe ease of immigrating software artifacts out of the data repositoryof the source SDE without knowledge of its internal representation.

Kearns                    1990-01-01                    Data refinement is converting a program that uses oneset of variables to an equally correct program that uses another setof variables, usually of different types.  There have been a number ofseemingly different mathematical definitions of data refinement.  Wepresent a unifying view of data refinement as a special case ofprocedural refinement, which is simpler to understand.  All thedata refinement theories in the literature are shown to be instancesof two formulas, but we show that there are actually an infinite numberof theories.  In addition, we introduce the concepts of nonlocal datarefinement, data refinement using semi-invariants, and proceduraloptimization using data refinement.

The systemconsists of two calibrated cameras that provide images to a real-time,pipelined-parallel optic-flow algorithm that can robustly computeoptic-flow and calculate the 3-D position of a moving object atapproximately 5 Hz rates.  These 3-D positions serve as input to apredictive kinematic control algorithm that uses an $alpha~ - ~beta~ - ~gamma$filter to update the position of a robotic arm tracking the movingobject. Experimental results are presented for thetracking of a moving model train in a variety of different trajectories.

Boult, Mark Lerner                    1989-01-01                    This paper describes a new segmentation technique for very sparse surfaces which is based on minimizing the energy of the surfaces in the scene.  While it could be used in almost any system as part of surface reconstruction/model recovery, the algorithm is designed to be usable when the depth information is scattered and very sparse, as is generally the case with depth generated by stereo algorithms.  We show results from a sequential algorithm and discuss a working prototype that executes on the massively parallel Connection Machine. The idea of segmentation by energy minimization is not new, however past techniques have relied on discrete regularization or Markov random fields to model the surfaces to build smooth surfaces and detect depth edges.  In addition, both of the aforementioned techniques are ineffective at energy minimization for very sparse data.  The technique presented herein models thesurfaces with reproducing kernel-based splines which can be shown to solve a regularized surface reconstruction problem.  From the functional form of these splines we derive computable upper and lower bounds on the energy of a surface over a given finite region.  The computation of the spline, and the corresponding surface representation are quite efficient for very sparse data. An interesting property of the algorithm is that it makes no attempt to determine segmentation boundaries; the algorithm can be viewed as a classification scheme which segments the data into collections of points which are ``from'' the same surface.

D. Durand                    1989-01-01                    Reducing synchronization constraints in parallel simulated annealingalgorithms can improve performance.  However, this introduces error inthe global cost function.  Previous work in parallel simulatedannealing suggests that if the amount of error in the cost function iscontrolled, good quality results can still be obtained.  In thispaper, we present a model of error in asynchronous parallel simulatedannealing algorithms to partition graphs and use it to predict thebehavior of three different synchronization strategies.  These threeapproaches were implemented on a 20-processor Encore, a shared memory,MIMD multiprocessor, and tested on a variety of graphs.As predicted, the strategy which allows controlled error yieldssolutions comparable to those of the serial algorithm with greatlyimproved running time.  Speedups from 5 to 11 (depending on thedensity of the graphs) using 16 processors were obtained.  Incontrast, the more synchronized version exhibited unacceptably highrunning times, whereas the version characterized by uncontrolled erroryielded significantly poorer results.  This confirms behavior seen inparallel simulated annealing algorithms to perform placement in VLSIcircuit layout systems.

Chan                    1989-01-01                    BCT (Binary Classification Tree) is a system that learns from examples and\rrepresents learned concepts as a binary polythetic decision tree.  Polythetic\rtrees differ from monothetic decision trees in that a logical combination\rof multiple (versus a single) attribute values may label each tree\rarc.  Statistical evaluations are used to recursively partition the concept\rspace in two and expand the tree.  As with standard decision trees,\rleaves denote classifications.  Classes are predicted for unseen instances \rby traversing appropriate branches in the tree to the leaves.

We propose a new method, called the minimumspanning tree write, by which a processor in the network shouldmulticast a write of a logical data-item, to all the processors thatstore replicas of the item. Then we show that the minimum spanningtree write is optimal from the communication cost point of view.  Wealso demonstrate that the method by which a write is multicast to allthe replicas of a data-item, affects the optimal replication scheme ofthe item, i.e., at which processors in the network the replicas shouldbe located.  Therefore, next we consider the problem of determining anoptimal replication scheme for a data item, assuming that eachprocessor employs the minimum spanning tree write at run-time.  Theproblem for general networks is shown NP-Complete, but we provideefficient algorithms to obtain an optimal allocation scheme for threecommon types of network topologies.  They are completely-connected,tree, and ring networks.  For these topologies, efficient algorithmsare also provided for the case in which reliability considerationsdictate a minimum number of replicas.

We introduce a paradigm, calleddata-reduction, for the parallel evaluation of a general datalogprogram. Several parallelization strategies discussed previously in[CW, GST, W, WS] are special cases of this paradigm.  The paradigmparallelizes the evaluation by partitioning among the processors theinstantiations of the rules.  After presenting the paradigm, wediscuss the following issues, that we see fundamental forparallelization strategies derived from the paradigm: properties ofthe strategies that enable a reduction in the communication overhead,decomposability, load balancing, and application to programs withnegation.  We prove that decomposability, a concept introducedpreviously in [WS, CW], is undecidable.

Tait                    1989-01-01                    This paper analyzes recent research in the field\rof distributed file systems, with a particular emphasis on the problem\rof high availability.  Several of the techniques involved in building\rsuch a system are discussed individually: naming, replication,\rmultiple versions, caching, stashing, and logging.  These techniques\rrange from extensions of ideas used in centralized file systems,\rthrough new notions already in use, to radical ideas that have not yet\rbeen implemented.  A number of working and proposed systems are\rdescribed in conjunction with the analysis of each technique.  The\rpaper concludes that a low degree of replication, a liberal use of\rclient and server caching, and optimistic behavior in the face of\rnetwork partition are all necessary to ensure high availability.

This is a variant of the famous gossipingproblem (see [HHL] for a survey).  Given a set of communication costsbetween pairs of participant sites, we establish that the necessarycommunication cost for any atomic commitment algorithm is twice thecost of a certain minimum spanning tree.  We also establish thenecessary communication time for any atomic commitment algorithm,given a set of communication delays between pairs of participantsites, and the time at which each participant completes itssubtransaction.  Then we determine that both lower bounds are alsoupper bounds in the following sense.  There is an efficient (i.e.polynomial-time) algorithm that, in the absence of failures, has aminimum communication cost.  There is another efficient algorithmthat, in the absence of failures, has a minimum communication time.However, unless P=NP, there is no efficient algorithm which has aminimum communication complexity, namely, for which the product ofcommunication cost and communication time is minimum.  Then we presenta simple, linear time, distributed algorithm, called TREE-COMMIT,whose communication complexity is not worse than $p$ times the minimumcomplexity, where $p$ is the number of participants.  Finally, wedemonstrate that TREE-COMMIT is superior to the existing variations ofthe two-phase commit protocol.

We replace our previous assumptions ofisotropic texture by knowledge of the autocorrelation moment matrix ofthe texture when viewed head on.  The orientation of a texturedsurface is then deduced from the effects of foreshortening on theseautocorrelation moments.  This technique is applied to natural imagesof planar textured surfaces and gives significantly improved resultswhen applied to anisotropic textures which under the assumption ofisotropy mimic the effects of projective foreshortening.  Thepotential practicality of this method for higher level imageunderstanding systems is discussed.

Tsai                    1989-01-01                    Camera placement experiments are presented that demonstrate theeffectiveness of a viewpoint planning algorithm that avoids occlusionof a visual target.  A CCD camera mounted on a robot in a hand-eyeconfiguration is placed at planned unobstructed viewpoints to observea target on a real object.  The validity of the method is tested byplacing the camera inside the viewing region, that is constructedusing the proposed new sensor placement planning algorithm, andobserving whether the target is truly visible. The accuracy of theboundary of the constructed viewing region is tested by placing thecamera at the critical locations of the viewing region boundary andconfirming that the target is barely visible. The corresponding scenesfrom the candidate viewpoints are shown demonstrating that occlusionsare properly avoided.

Tsai                    1989-01-01                    We present a model-based vision system that automatically plans theplacement and optical settings of vision sensors in order to meetcertain generic task requirements common to most industrial machinevision applications. From the planned viewpoints, features of intereston an object will satisfy particular constraints in the image. In thiswork, the vision sensor is a CCD camera equipped with a programmablelens (i.e. zoom lens) and the image constraints considered are:visibility, resolution and field of view. The proposed approach uses ageometric model of the object as well as a model of the sensor, inorder to reason about the task and the environment. The sensorplanning system then computes the regions in space as well as theoptical settings that satisfy each of the constraints separately.These results are finally combined to generate acceptable viewinglocations and optical settings satisfying all constraintssimultaneously.  Camera planning experiments are described in which arobot-arm positions the camera at a computed location and the plannedoptical settings are set automatically. The corresponding scenes fromthe candidate viewpoints are shown demonstrating that the constraintsare indeed satisfied. Other constraints, such as depth of focus, aswell as other vision sensors can also be considered resulting in afully integrated sensor planning system.

Barghouti                    1989-01-01                    The Rule-Based Development Environment (RBDE)  is a recently-developedapproach for providing intelligent assistance to developers working ona large-scale  software project.  RBDEs  model the development processin terms of rules,  and then enact this  model by automatically firingrules at  the  appropriate  time.  The RBDE  approach has been used todevelop single-user environments, but support  for multiple developerscooperating on the same project is still not  available because of thelack  of mechanisms  that can synchronize    the  efforts of  multipledevelopers, who concurrently  select commands, causing  the  firing ofmultiple rules  (either directly  or  via chaining)  that concurrentlyaccess shared data.  Conflicts  between different rules and concurrentaccess  to shared data may cause  the  violation of consistency in theproject  database,  and  thus    necessitate the  synchronization   ofconcurrent  activities.   The conjecture of  this  proposal is that anRBDE can provide the  required synchronization  if it is provided withknowledge about what it means for the data of a specific project to bein  a consistent state,  and about the semantics  of   operations thatdevelopers perform on the data.  The research that this paper proposeswill formulate  a framework for  specifying consistency of data  in anRBDE,  and formulate  a mechanism  for  synchronizing the  actions  ofconcurrent rules fired on behalf of multiple developers cooperating ona common or different tasks.

The method is distinguishedby the fact that it is .i pure i.e., does not require interprocessorcommunication, or synchronization overhead.  The method cannot be usedto parallelize every logic program, but we syntactically characterizeseveral classes of logic programs that are $sharable$, i.e. programsto which the method can be applied (e.g., the class of linear singlerule programs).  We also provide a characterization of a class of$nonsharable$ programs, and demonstrate that sharability is afundamental semantic property of the program, that is independent ofthe parallelization method proposed in this paper.

Itis commonly recovered from time-varying imagery in the form of atwo-dimensional image-flow field.  This thesis is about computation ofimage-flow.A new framework is proposed that classifies the image-flow informationavailable in time-varying imagery into two categories - conservationinformation and neighborhood information.  Each type of information isrecovered in the form of an estimate accompanied by acovariance-matrix.  Image-flow is then computed by fusing the twoestimates using estimation-theoretic techniques. This framework isshown to allow estimation of certain types of discontinuousflow-fields without any a-priori knowledge about the location ofdiscontinuities.  An algorithm based on this framework is described.Results of applying this algorithm to a variety of image-sequences arealso discussed.The new framework is shown to be applicable identically to each one ofthe three major approaches for recovering conservation information,i.e., gradient-based approach, correlation-based approach andspatiotemporal energy-based approach. The formulation of neighborhoodinformation used in this framework is also shown to reduce to some ofthe existing smoothing-based formulations under various simplifyingassumptions. In essence, the framework described in this thesisunifies various existing approaches for image-flow computation. Suchunification is shown to be useful in analyzing various existingframeworks as well as in generating new frameworks.The new framework is also shown to serve as a platform to integratethe three approaches mentioned above. It is observed that themeasurements obtained by the three approaches have differenterror-characteristics. This situation is regarded analogous to themulti-sensor fusion problem, where the algorithms based on the threeapproaches behave as multiple sensors measuring image-flow.  Anintegrated framework is described that applies the principles ofstatistical estimation theory to fuse the measurements obtained fromdifferent approaches. The resulting estimate of image-flow has theminimum expected-error. Some algorithms based on this framework aredescribed. Several proposals for extension of this thesis are alsoincluded.

by President Bollinger                            President Bollinger announced that Columbia University along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all Ivy League universities) filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the Executive Order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”This recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.I am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.Sincerely, Mary C.
