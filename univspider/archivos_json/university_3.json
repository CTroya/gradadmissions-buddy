Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Explore Non-Degree Admissions Non-Degree Admissions Cornell welcomes a limited number of visiting non-degree graduate students to the Ithaca campus each year to conduct research with a faculty host or take specific in-person courses. Maximum Enrollment Non-degree graduate students are limited to a maximum enrollment of two semesters and may not enroll in a degree-granting program at Cornell without formally applying and being approved for admission. Tuition Non-degree graduate students enrolled during a regular semester are required to pay tuition. In some cases, a tuition waiver or fellowship may be available from the host field. There is no tuition charge for the summer if the student is not enrolled in courses. Learn more about tuition costs . Health Insurance Like degree-seeking students, non-degree graduate students are automatically enrolled in Cornell’s Student Health Plan (SHP). If a student has coverage through another health insurance plan that is comparable to the SHP, they may file a written appeal with the Office of Student Health Benefits. Note: In most cases, international students are required to purchase SHP. Learn more about student health benefits . Admissions Requirements Education Credentials: All non-degree students enrolled in the Graduate School must possess education credentials equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree or be pursuing graduate-level studies at their home institution (if applicable). On the application form, applicants should describe their postsecondary education history and provide applicable transcripts and diplomas. Learn more about international degree equivalencies . English Proficiency: All non-degree graduate applicants must demonstrate English language proficiency even if they will not be taking classes or supervising students. See Cornell’s English proficiency requirements to learn more . Unlike degree-seeking applicants, non-degree applicants may submit recently-expired scores or copies of a paper score report. Financial Resources All international graduate students must provide evidence of adequate financial resources to obtain student visa documents. These resources should be sufficient to cover the costs of attendance, including living expenses, for the duration of their stay at Cornell. Learn more about the costs of attendance . The Application The hosting graduate field will need to supply each non-degree graduate applicant a single-use “Application Key” code, which can be obtained from the Graduate School. Next, the applicant should complete our abbreviated “ Quick Application .” After the applicant has applied, the graduate field will review and admit the applicant and send an offer letter—just like for degree-seeking applicants. A sample Non-Degree Admit Letter available to fields upon request. Admitted non-degree graduate students should respond to their offer of admission online . After accepting the offer, international non-degree graduate students will receive instructions for requesting student visa documents (I-20 or DS-2019) Upon Arrival When they arrive on campus, non-degree graduate students MUST do the following: Contact field of study or host department as soon as possible. Visit the Graduate School’s Student Services Office in 172 Caldwell Hall for information about registration procedures. In order to comply with U.S. immigration law, international students must be registered with the university within 30 days of the I-20 or DS-2019 start date. If international, check in with International Services: Office of Global Learning online . This is also a U.S. immigration requirement.

This interactive seminar series is designed to provide graduate and professional students with some PERSPECTIVE on both research and practical strategies that support student goals. Join us to learn from the experts how to support your health and well-being now and in the future. Fall 2020 Sessions Coping with 2020: Resiliency for International Scholars With so many stressors associated with events that are beyond the control of any person, it is easy to understand why international scholars, in particular, may feel vulnerable, anxious, and isolated, especially in light of the recent U.S. election. The goal is for students and postdocs to leave with an understanding of best practices to prioritize your health and well-being, the importance of community, and what you can do today to strengthen your resiliency. This session is open for all, but will focus on the needs of our international community. Presenter: Wai-Kwong Wong, Ph.D., assistant director for community based services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Cornell Health Back to Basics: Self-Care 101 Stress and the cumulative nature of stress can have a detrimental impact on the mind and body. In addition, different cultural and familial values can inform one’s decision to express stress in different ways, and whether to express stress and seek help accordingly. This presentation will cover the nature of stress, its impact on the mind and body as it relates to academic performance from diverse lenses. The presentation will include recommendations on coping. Presenter: Catherine Thrasher- Carroll, M.A., mental health promotion program director, Skorton Center for Health Initiatives The Importance of Meaning-Making During Uncertainty Congratulations – you are becoming an expert in your research/scholarly pursuits as a graduate student! Does that feel like it is enough for you? During times of uncertainty, do you find yourself questioning the value of your work? It is human nature to have deep questions of value and worth which can be amplified at times when stressors are so great and making an impact on you, but you don’t know where to begin. This session is designed to consider one’s meaning and purpose while examining the interconnected nature of humanity. Join us to unearth what happens during times of crisis and strategies for how you can explore and regain a commitment back to you, as a whole person. Presenter: Oliver Goodrick, associate dean for spirituality and meaning making, director, Cornell United Religious Work It’s Complicated:  Family and Friends and Differences We have witnessed a divide among perspectives, opinions, and judgments recently in the United States leading up to the national election. And, our family and friends may not share the same ideas leaving us to feel confused, concerned, and alone. The goal of this session is to talk candidly about relationships that we hold close and what to do in working out differences. We will address how to separate the issue from the person, when to lean in and when to back away, and skills for reflective listening.

Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series As part of a continued orientation experience for incoming graduate and professional students, the Graduate School sponsors a special seminar series for first-year graduate and professional students. The purpose of Graduate School Primer workshops is for students to gain valuable information and skills to make a successful transition into the role of a Cornell graduate or professional student. Workshops will take place virtually mid-July through August 2024.  Session dates and times will be announced in June. 2024 Workshops Understanding and Overcoming the Imposter Experience Presenter: Jessamyn Perlus, senior associate director, Cornell Career Services Did you know that impostor feelings are normal and that most high-achieving graduate students experience these feelings at some point? Join us to better understand the impostor phenomenon; learn to recognize it and see recent research on how it can be a barrier to graduate student success. By defining it and sharing experiences, you’ll learn evidence-based tools to help combat impostor feelings. Getting the Mentoring You Need and Want Presenters: Colleen McLinn, Ph.D., associate dean for professional development, and Sara Xayarath Hernández, associate dean for inclusion and student and faculty engagement In this workshop, graduate students reflect on their mentoring experiences and needs, learn to co-construct and manage mutual expectations within their mentoring relationships, and develop strategies to establish a network of mentors to get the mentoring they need and want across multiple domains. This workshop also introduces the FAIM (Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring) Resource Center , which provides a framework to support the development and advancement of inclusive and equity-minded mentoring practices within graduate and postdoctoral education. The FAIM framework is comprised of an inclusive mentoring philosophy, key principles, and practical tools and resources intended to be adapted and adopted to meet the contextual needs of mentors and mentees. Understanding Doctoral Funding at Cornell Presenter: Jason Kahabka, associate dean for administration At Cornell, almost all Ph.D. students receive funding that pays tuition and provides a living stipend through a combination of fellowships, assistantships, and external scholarships. This presentation will explain how stipends are paid, what your responsibilities are, and provides insight on how to be an active participant in your own funding plan. Maximize Your Every Minute Presenter: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life While there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to best manage your most precious resource (TIME), time management is a skill that can be learned! Given the many demands for your time and attention to support your many identities, roles, and relationships, techniques can be learned to help you be able to intentionally decide what you should do when. Join us for an interactive discussion that reviews commonly used techniques, how to make strategic decisions that support the whole you, and how to maintain relationships when setting boundaries. In addition, share with others what you have found works best for you. The Basics of Mental Health and Well-Being Presenter: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life Make sure that you develop your mental health support plan so that you can have the energy and reserves to support your academic success. The stressors of being a graduate student are real and understanding the research for how you can best support your mental health and well-being is key to your future success. In this session, we will define mental health, learn key concepts of resilience, and emphasize the importance of sense of belonging and self-care practices. You’ll be able to connect with others in the session. University and local resources are also provided. Creating, Building, and Maintaining Social Networks Presenters: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life; and panel of esteemed students Relationships that are grounded in trust, respect, and acceptance are the strongest factor in building and maintaining resilience. And, starting a new program at a new place can be challenging to create, build, and maintain social networks.  So, what is a graduate student supposed to do? During this one-hour session, we’ll review the value of social networks, and more importantly, hear from graduate and professional students who have strategies and suggestions for how to build your social network right from the beginning. Developing as an Instructor Presenters: Colleen McLinn, Ph.D., associate dean for professional development, and Derina Samuel, Ph.D., associate director, graduate student development, Center for Teaching Innovation Will you have teaching responsibilities this fall? Are you thinking about a faculty career track and want to develop your skills as an instructor? If your answer is “yes”, or you just want to find out more about teaching, join us to explore the many resources that are available to you at Cornell. At this session we will discuss the various teaching roles graduate students experience and identify areas you could develop to ensure a successful teaching experience. Navigating Graduate School: The Good, the Grad, and the Ugly Presenter: Josephine Martell, associate dean for academics Come and learn about the top things that former graduate students wish they had known before they started their research degree programs. This session will share critical advice on setting achievable goals, creating mutual expectations with mentors, assembling an effective committee, research organization, the value of literature reviews, presenting and publishing, maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and more. In addition to a short presentation, participants will have opportunities to break into smaller groups to reflect on, and brainstorm, how to apply the guidance in their own disciplines and unique situations. Exploring Career Options In and Outside Academia: Make an Action Plan for Your Future Presenters: Susi Varvayanis, executive director of Careers Beyond Academia, and Christine Holmes, director of postdoctoral studies You might be thinking it is too early to think about the end as you are starting, but in this session you will learn how important it can be to keep your options open, how you can take advantage of your time at Cornell to gain experiences that help you rule in or rule out different career sectors based on what you value and in what environments you thrive. You will leave with three things you can do that don’t take long at all that will increase your agency.

Families Make Your Family a Part of the Cornell Family Looking for information? Please go to our Students with Families website and visit us on our Facebook page . The Cornell University Graduate School recognizes the importance of family in supporting a healthy student life experience and that families are essential allies in encouraging the academic success and well-being of our students. As a result, we provide resources and services to assist spouses and partners with their own ambitions and goals, along with essential support for families with child(ren). We operationalized this through the creation of the campus-wide Students with Families Advisory Committee, which brings together staff, faculty, and students from different units. The goal of this committee is to approach student families holistically, determine priorities, and develop new partnerships to enhance programming efforts. This group provides direction and makes university recommendations to what additional needs our families have. In addition, this committee helps with communication so that key offices are informed of resources available to partners and students with children to help with dissemination of information. Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life, is the chair of this committee. Our main project as a committee was to create a website that included information, policies, and resources for our expectant students, students with children, and student partners and spouses. We encourage you to visit this website for more information about resources and services Cornell has to support you and your family. To complement the efforts of the university website, we also sponsor a Facebook site with the following goals: 1) increase community and connection among our students with families population, 2) serve as an effective method of communication to the students with families population directly, and 3) more easily identify our students with families. We encourage you to like us on Facebook . As always, the Graduate School is interested in your experience. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Janna Lamey ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ).

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Student Experience Help and Support Mental Health While Away from Campus Mental Health While Away from Campus What can I do to prepare for being away from campus in regards to mental health? If I am away from campus, can I still use Cornell Health services? How can I make sure I have a support network when I am away from campus? What can I do to prepare myself mentally for in absentia status or travel? How do I handle health insurance issues when away from campus? Which resources should I be familiar with before leaving the U.S.? What can I do to prepare for being away from campus in regards to mental health? If you know that mental health is a concern for you, our number one recommendation is to plan ahead. Consider the mental health support you will need well in advance of your move. Make an appointment with your mental health and/or medical care providers to talk about your plans for travel and/or relocation. (If you are traveling abroad, consider also consulting with Cornell Health Travel Services .) Will you need professional services in your new location? Would it help to have copies of certain health records? Can your current providers or health insurer help you identify resources and/or referrals? Though Cornell Health does not have the capacity to provide telehealth services, some private therapists and commercial services do offer remote counseling. If you take prescription medications, make sure you have what you need before you go, as well as a plan for getting refills. If I am away from campus, can I still use Cornell Health services? Students who are not in the Ithaca area may call Cornell Health at 607-255-5155 to consult with a health care provider about a medical or mental health concern (24/7 for emergencies and urgent concerns). Even from afar, they can help you determine what care you need and how and when to get it. How can I make sure I have a support network when I am away from campus? Connect with people who care about you. Talk before you go with friends, family, mentors, or advisors, and make specific plans for connecting on a regular basis. Do you have the apps you need on your phones and computers? If you’re going abroad, how will you navigate living in different time zones? Can you put into words how they can be helpful to you? Can you ask how you might be helpful to them? It may be difficult now to know how you will connect with people in your new location, but it might help to start imagining it…and asking others to share experiences they have had. What can I do to prepare myself mentally for in absentia status or travel? Prioritize self-care. Shifting to in absentia status, pursuing research abroad, and traveling to or living in a new location can be disruptive. It’s important to make a list now of what you already know to be key strategies for taking care of yourself, and then use it in your new location: “Advice to Self.” Some of those strategies should be part of your routine (such as eating right, moving your body, getting enough sleep, socializing, engaging in mindfulness/meditation/prayer). You also have a pretty good idea of what helps you when you are in crisis…or feel one coming on. Write them down so you can turn to them without thinking in times of need. You might consider attaching to your list some of the behaviors you know are “high risk” for you (e.g., too much or not enough alone time, screen time, work time, sleep time; self-medicating in one way or another to “manage” feelings; etc.). How do I handle health insurance issues when away from campus? Understand your health insurance before you need to use it. This will take some work. Go to your insurer’s website or talk with a member services representative to learn about how your plan works in the area you will be living/traveling. If you are enrolled in Cornell’s Student Health Plan (SHP), your plan will work the same anywhere in the United States . If you’re studying outside the U.S., your copays and co-insurance won’t change, but you may have to pay for care at the time services are provided and submit a claim for reimbursement . SHP also includes 24/7 worldwide travel assistance whenever you’re more than 100 miles from your permanent address, in the U.S. or abroad. This is robust coverage (more than just insurance), so take the time to review it before you travel. Which resources should I be familiar with before leaving the U.S.? If you will be out of the U.S., review Cornell’s health insurance requirements for students traveling abroad . Make sure you register with Cornell’s International Travel Registry before you go. In the event of an emergency, the Travel Registry helps university officials to reach you and provide assistance. Global Cornell provides information about health, safety, and other important considerations for all Cornellians planning international travel.

Kristina Smiley Wins 2017 3MT Kristina Smiley “If I asked you what this bird, this fish, and this new mom all had in common, you probably wouldn’t say that they all feed their offspring with milk,” began Kristina Smiley, a doctoral student in psychology, in her Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation on her research into prolactin, a hormone produced in new mothers. Smiley went on to win this year’s 3MT competition and was awarded the first-place ($1500) prize on March 29th. Winning second place, Prateek Sehgal, a doctoral student in mechanical and aerospace engineering, presented on using sound waves to separate cancer particles. Prateek Sehgal The People’s Choice prize was awarded to Xiangkun “Elvis” Cao, a doctoral student in mechanical and aerospace engineering, for his presentation on the fever phone, an app that can diagnose illness. “We in the Graduate School, along with our judges from across campus, were much impressed with the innovative research and remarkable presentation skills of our participants,” said Jan Allen, associate dean of academic and student affairs and the event’s organizer. 3MT is a competition developed by the University of Queensland in 2008 that challenges graduate students to present their research in three minutes to a non-specialist audience. Competitors are scored based on audience engagement, audience comprehension, and their own communication skills.

wins 2018 3MT Competition Jason Guss presenting his three-minute thesis “I’ve spent hundreds of hours collecting poop from mice,” began doctoral student Jason Guss in his Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation on his research into the relationship between the gut microbiome and bone strength. Guss, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, had three minutes to explain his complex research and its significance to a panel of student, faculty, and staff judges from units across campus. The non-specialist panel judged the presentations on their comprehension and clarity, engagement, and communication style. From the 17 students in the preliminary rounds, Guss was one of eight to make it to the final round of the Fourth Annual Three Minute Thesis Competition. The reaction from the audience and the combined scores of the six judges signaled Guss’s first place win of $1,500. Derek Holyoak, also a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, placed second, winning $1,000 for his presentation, “OA, No Way: A Simple Approach to Treat Osteoarthritis (OA).” The 150-member audience tied Holyoak and Guss for the $500 People’s Choice Award. “The 3MT gave us an opportunity to let loose and have fun while presenting our research,” Holyoak said. “I plan to continue using the enthusiasm, humor, and actions I included in my 3MT for all of my future research and teaching presentations.” The first 3MT competitions took place in 2008 as the University of Queensland. Since that time, over 600 graduate schools in 65 countries host competitions to celebrate the innovative research of their graduate students. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2012. Since that time, the event has grown steadily. This year’s winners were invited to present for Cornell’s Board of Trustees. Derek Holyoak and Jason Guss Jan Allen, associate dean of academic affairs for the Graduate School, said the competition provides an important professional development opportunity. Students are challenged to distill years of specialized research into a compelling and brief talk for general audiences, a valuable skill for students entering any future career. “We have such an enjoyable time watching our graduate students present their three-minute talks,” she said. “We are so amazed and excited by the innovative scholarship and research our students are conducting. And they each have such a supportive ‘fan club’ in the audience. It’s fun to watch their friends and colleagues urge them on, too.” According to finalist Carol-Rose Little, a doctoral student in linguistics, “it is very easy to be so involved in our research that we forget the bigger picture. The 3MT competition had tremendous value as it helped me think about how to effectively communicate my bigger-picture research results and impacts to the public. It was also a fun and rewarding challenge to present to a nonspecialized audience.” 3MT Finalists Jason Guss – My “Theces” on Feces May Make Your Bones Stronger – Biomedical Engineering Special Committee Chair: Christopher Hernandez Derek Holyoak – OA, No Way: A Simple Approach to Treat Osteoarthritis (OA) – Biomedical Engineering Special Committee Chair: Marjolein van der Meulen Hugo Milan – Cool Technologies for Happier Cows – Biological & Environmental Engineering Special Committee Chair: Kifle Gebremedhin Carol-Rose Little – What Can the Ch’ol Language Tell Us About Grammar? – Linguistics Special Committee Chairs: Miloje Despic & Sarah Murray Sabrina Solouki – Vaccines Build Armies – Immunology & Infectious Disease Special Committee Chair: Avery August Mengran Wang – Three Photon Microscopy – Seeing Deeper Inside the Brain – Graduate Field of Biophysics Special Committee Chair: Chunhui Xu Divya Shiroor – Regeneration 101: Lessons from Flatworms – Molecular & Integrative Physiology Special Committee Chair: Carolyn Adler William Pennock – Better Models Lead to Better Water Treatment Designs for the World – Civil & Environmental Engineering Special Committee Chair: Leonard Lion 3MT 2018 Finalists Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Teddy Yesudasan Wins 2019 3MT Competition By Katya Hrichak “Growing up in southern India, all I saw were white potatoes, and so when I came to Ithaca as an international student and went grocery shopping for the first time at Wegmans, I was shocked to see potatoes that came in different colors,” began Teddy Yesudasan, a research master’s student in plant breeding and genetics, at the fifth annual Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. 3MT 2019 winners (from left): Pamela Meyerhofer (People’s Choice), Teddy Yesudasan (1st place), and Shao-Pei Chou (2nd place). Credit: Phil Wilde Alongside nine other students selected from 22 preliminary round competitors, Yesudasan had to present his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of non-specialist judges, staff, and students from across campus. Presentations were judged on their comprehension, clarity, engagement, and communication style. His presentation, “What Makes a Red Potato Red?” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to genetics, genomics, and development doctoral student Shao-Pei Chou for her presentation, “Decoding the 2% Difference That Makes Us Human.” After nearly 200 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award was presented to policy analysis and management doctoral candidate Pamela Meyerhofer for her presentation, “Paid Family Leave and Fertility.” “Prior to competing, I was struggling to explain why my research was interesting to someone besides myself,” said Meyerhofer. “Having this compelling framework makes it easier to discuss and share my work.” Chou voiced similar takeaways, adding that her public speaking and communication skills were enhanced by competing. “I often found it’s difficult to explain what I’m working on to my friends and family. Even to other biologists, my field is new to them,” Chou said. “I made a decision last year that I was going to compete for the next 3MT and use that as a chance to force myself to find an … excellent way to explain my research. It worked super well!” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 600 graduate schools in over 65 countries. This year, Cornell’s winners will compete in the inaugural Ivy+ 3MT competition to be held April 25 at the United Nations (UN) in New York City. Yesudasan will also compete via video at the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools annual conference in Philadelphia in April. Finalists for 3MT 2019 with Associate Dean Jan Allen.

Culture Ph.D. Candidate Wins Three Minute Thesis Competition Bruno Shirley’s winning presentation “So, this is a coin from 12 th century Sri Lanka. And, like many coins, it’s inscribed with the name of the monarch who commissioned it,” began Bruno Shirley, a doctoral candidate in Asian literature, religion, and culture at the seventh annual Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Shirley presented his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of judges and a virtual audience from across campus and around the world. Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. His presentation, “Constructing Buddhist kingship in medieval Sri Lanka,” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to physics doctoral candidate Vaibhav Sharma for his presentation, “What happens when atoms colder than outer space are spun around?” After nearly 100 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were presented to plant pathology and plant-microbe biology doctoral candidate Juliana González-Tobón for her presentation, “Can bacteria smell their food?” For Shirley, whose fieldwork plans were disrupted by the pandemic, entering the 3MT enabled him to reengage with his dissertation research. “These three-minute talks are more than just elevator pitches; the process helped me to really hone-in on what’s most important in my dissertation topic,” he said. “It’s so easy to lose sight of the woods for the trees when we’re deep into dissertation-land, and this was a valuable opportunity to step back and re-orient.” Sharma, while enthusiastic about his research, struggled to articulate it clearly and compellingly to friends and family in the past. Through the 3MT, he learned valuable skills about concisely summarizing his complex research. “Before 3MT, I didn’t believe I could talk about my research in just three minutes. The 3MT preparation stage was an eye-opener for me, and I realized the value of each and every sentence. There was no benefit to adding a single ‘filler’ or useless word. I learned how to cut down on verbosity and explain even difficult concepts in brief and easy to understand language. It will help me in the long run if I write shorter and better papers,” he said. “And now if anyone asks me about my research, I can just give them the link to my 3MT video.” González-Tobón wanted to enter the 3MT since she began her doctoral program and appreciated that this year’s virtual platform allowed for a larger audience. “It was a great opportunity to invite friends and family from around the world. As an international student, being able to invite everyone felt fantastic and was so heart-warming!” she said. “Also, since the finalists were both international and domestic and from several different research areas, it was amazing to see how diverse this community is and how different our expertise areas are.” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. Cornell’s winner will go on to compete in the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools 3MT competition in late April. “We are so proud of each and every one of our finalists,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “They not only gave excellent presentations, but learned important skills about research communication in the process that will benefit them as they graduate and move into new roles.” Cornell’s seventh 3MT final round competition was held on March 22, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. on Zoom.

Biology Ph.D. Candidate Wins Three Minute Thesis Competition Bhargav Sanketi’s winning presentation. “My thesis explores the blueprint behind building a small intestine. I call it ‘to be or “knot” to be’,” began Bhargav Sanketi, a doctoral candidate in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, at the sixth Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Sanketi presented his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of judges and an audience from across campus. Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly they summarized their research using only one static slide to a general audience. His presentation, “To be or ‘knot’ to be: Blueprint for a small intestine,” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to food science and technology doctoral candidate Rachel Allison for her presentation, “What CAN we do about stinky wine?” After nearly 200 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $300 were presented to entomology doctoral candidate Kara Fikrig for her presentation, “Are mosquitoes picky eaters?” Having enjoyed the 3MT as an audience member in the past, Sanketi appreciated the opportunity to participate in – and win – this year’s competition. “I think as scientists, we get so lost in our work that it’s easy to lose sight of what’s important,” he said. “I had attended previous editions of 3MT and always found them really entertaining. The idea of getting a diverse audience excited about a pretty heavy academic topic forces you to zoom out and see the big picture.” For Allison, undertaking the challenge of distilling a dense topic into accessible and engaging content was a primary motivator for her participation. “Going through the job interview process, I realized how challenging it could be to communicate my research experience to a non-specialist audience,” she said. “My career goal is to one day combine technical and business consulting in the wine industry, and adaptable communication skills will be essential. As a result, I have been trying to practice by taking advantage of more speaking opportunities.” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 600 graduate schools in over 65 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015. The event has grown steadily since that time and this year, Cornell’s winner will compete in the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools regional competition next month, and the top two winners from that event will showcase their research at the Council of Graduate Schools annual meeting in December 2021. “I am so impressed with each and every one of this year’s competitors,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “They are all to be recognized for their successful presentations. In addition to presenting their complex research in just three minutes, everyone rose to the challenge of doing so in a virtual format. These skills will prove beneficial in academic work as well as in future careers.” Understanding the importance of communicating scientific topics clearly, Fikrig looked at the 3MT as a way to learn techniques for getting and holding listeners’ attention when sharing her research broadly. “I value science communication and recognize the importance of being able to explain my science in a way that is both comprehensible and interesting to the public. This is especially true since I study mosquitoes – the threat of disease transmission underscores the need to effectively communicate about my study system,” she said. “After watching videos of past 3MT presenters, I thought that the competition would be a great opportunity to learn and practice science communication skills. And I was not disappointed!” Cornell’s sixth 3MT final round competition was held on Thursday, March 18, 2021 at 4:15 p.m. on Zoom. This story is also available on the Cornell Chronicle website .

What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? I think as scientists, we get so lost in our work that it’s easy to lose sight of what’s important. I had attended previous editions of 3MT and always found them really entertaining. The idea of getting a diverse audience excited about a pretty heavy academic topic forces you to zoom out and see the big picture. It feels nostalgic, like the first time I started thinking about the project and the analogies I used to understand it better. Second Place: Rachel Allison, food science and technology doctoral candidate Watch Rachel Allison’s 3MT presentation . Presentation Title: “What CAN we do about stinky wine?” Special Committee Chair : Gavin Sacks Area of Research: Wine flavor chemistry Biography: Rachel Allison is a Ph.D. candidate and aspiring consultant in the field of food science. With a focus in wine flavor chemistry, her research looks at the development of reductive off-aromas during wine storage, particularly related to the stability of enological treatments with copper and interactions between wine and aluminum can packaging. Favorite Thing About Cornell: Curiosity is always encouraged. What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? Going through the job interview process, I realized how challenging it could be to communicate my research experience to a non-specialist audience. My career goal is to one day combine technical and business consulting in the wine industry, and adaptable communication skills will be essential. As a result, I have been trying to practice by taking advantage of more speaking opportunities. I credit my lab group for helping me to develop my presentation skills over the last few years. I have always received insightful feedback from my friends and colleagues, and they encouraged me to participate in the 3MT. I received many different perspectives so I learned to interpret and condense a lot of presentation lessons alongside building the thesis story. Every comment helped me to construct an effective final product. I’m sure the experience will help me as I write my thesis. People’s Choice: Kara Fikrig, entomology doctoral candidate Watch Kara Fikrig’s 3MT presentation . Presentation Title: “Are mosquitoes picky eaters?” Special Committee Chair: Laura Harrington Area of Research: Mosquito feeding ecology Biography: Kara Fikrig studies mosquito feeding behavior and hopes that her research will help public health efforts to reduce global suffering from mosquito-borne diseases. She believes that science communication is critical to achieve that goal. As such, she is dedicated to ensuring that science is understood and valued by the public and elected representatives. Favorite Thing About Cornell: The easy access to beautiful nature! What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? First, I would like to thank my family, friends, and lab for their support, both during this competition and throughout my development as a scientist. I decided to participate in the 3MT competition because I value science communication and recognize the importance of being able to explain my science in a way that is both comprehensible and interesting to the public. This is especially true since I study mosquitoes – the threat of disease transmission underscores the need to effectively communicate about my study system. After watching videos of past 3MT presenters, I thought that the competition would be a great opportunity to learn and practice science communication skills. And I was not disappointed! I learned new techniques, such as portraying enthusiasm despite being nervous, and had the opportunity to practice techniques that I had learned previously, like employing a hook to grab the listeners’ attention and using relatable metaphors. It was challenging to condense my project into three minutes – but the process of doing so helped me to realize that many of the details that I considered crucial were in fact unnecessary to understand the overarching message. The skills that I developed through participating in the 3MT competition will help me to more effectively and confidently communicate my science in the future. And I’m sure that the condensed explanation of my work will come in handy once social gatherings begin again!

Ph.D. Candidates Win Three Minute Thesis Competition Yurong You, Kim Hochstedler, and Lidia Komondy For the first time in Graduate School history, two doctoral candidates tied for first place in the eighth Cornell Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition, held on March 30, on Zoom. Yurong You, a doctoral candidate in computer science, and Kim Hochstedler, a doctoral candidate in statistics, wowed the judges and took home co-first place for their presentations, “Can Autonomous Vehicles Learn from Their Own Memories?” and “The Heart of Misdiagnosis,” respectively. Each were awarded the top prize of $1,500. Alongside six other finalists, Hochstedler and You presented their dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of judges and a virtual audience from across campus and around the world. Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to entomology doctoral candidate Lidia Komondy for her presentation, “Seeing is Believing, if You Know Where to Look,” and after nearly 100 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were also presented to You. This year’s judges included Eldora Ellison, Ph.D. ‘94, a member of Cornell’s Board of Trustees; Kim Wagner ‘85, a member of Cornell’s Board of Trustees; Bruno Shirley, an Asian literature, religion, and culture doctoral candidate and 2022 first place winner; and Matt Ranieri ‘06, M.S. ’09, Ph.D. ‘13, president of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Alumni Association. “The presentations were fascinating and came from finalists with expertise in so many impressive and diverse research topics. It was amazing to see how impactful these research projects were to the world,” said Komondy. “This experience helped me realize how important scientific research is outside the lab and how important it is to keep the public updated on the implications of our research findings.” Kim Hochstedler, Yurong You, and Fangming Cui attend the 3MT reception at the Big Red Barn. Each of the winners agreed that participating in the 3MT was a great way to practice talking about their research in a way that engages and excites individuals outside of their fields and that the experience will influence the way they share their research going forward. “The best way to explain things is to stand in the audience’s shoes and use simple words,” said You. “Participation in 3MT will undoubtedly shape my future presentations.” Hochstedler said, “As I continue to communicate my research in future presentations and projects, I think these lessons of how to connect with an audience and explain my work succinctly will remain valuable. I now feel very prepared for the next family reunion when people ask me what I’m working on at Cornell!” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. “The 3MT is an excellent way for our doctoral students to practice communicating complex ideas to a broader audience, which is a skill beneficial not only for their time as students but for when they enter the professional world as well,” said Kathryn J. Boor, dean of the Graduate School and vice provost for graduate education. “We are so proud of each and every one of this year’s finalists.” 2023 3MT Finalists Watch the 2023 Three Minute Thesis competition finale.

2024 Three Minute Thesis Competition Meagan Sundstrom says a few words after being announced first place winner. Photo: Simon Wheeler for Cornell University “I want you to remember a time when you were in a setting where you felt like you didn’t belong. I want you to remember how you felt in that setting, maybe isolated or out of place, and how much you felt like you wanted to continue going back to that setting—probably not much. These feelings are all too familiar for undergraduate women pursuing their studies in science, and in physics specifically,” began Meagan Sundstrom, a doctoral candidate in physics at the ninth annual Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Sundstrom presented her dissertation research in just three minutes on March 20 to a panel of judges and an audience from across campus while additional friends, family, advisors, and lab mates watched online. In the first in-person Cornell 3MT since 2019, presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. Sundstrom’s presentation, “Recognizing and Removing Barriers for Women in Physics,” earned her first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to information science doctoral student Sterling Williams-Ceci for her presentation, “AI Helps us Write – but at What Cost?” After nearly 60 in-person and 70 virtual audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were presented to biomedical and biological sciences doctoral candidate Sharada Gopal for her presentation, “Worming Our Way to a Longer Life.” This year’s judges included Jane Bunker, director of Cornell University Press; Joe Ellis, director of online degree program development at eCornell; David Lodge, the Francis J. DiSalvo Director of the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability; and Bob Riter, patient advocate for the Cornell Community Cancer Partnership. Organization of the competition and coaching of presenters was provided by the Graduate School Office of Career and Professional Development. “As grad students, there are a lot of opportunities to give your elevator pitch at conferences and more professional settings to more senior people in your field, and I thought this would be a really cool opportunity for me to try to tailor that pitch to a more general audience—how would I describe my research to my family and friends?—so that was fun,” said Sundstrom. Being able to “zoom out” and view her topic from a different perspective was also helpful for Sundstrom, who is currently writing her dissertation and appreciates having both formulated a storyline and thought about the broader impacts of her work. Williams-Ceci similarly enjoyed the chance to speak to a different type of audience than she is used to addressing. “I hadn’t really had an opportunity in grad school to try communicating to a broad audience, it’s always just to my lab, so I wanted to practice having a chance to really tell a story and not just go through the slides,” she said. “It really helped me know for a fact that I can tell a convincing story about a project that I’ve done.” 2024 Three Minute Thesis finalists. Photo: Simon Wheeler for Cornell University Gopal shared that the 3MT was a fun way to combine her longtime artistic interests with her science. “It seemed like such a fun event. I did a lot of theatre in college so I thought, ‘What can I do artistically here?’ and this seemed like a good mix of my scientific interest and my artistic theatre interests,” she said, adding that she also benefitted from looking at the bigger picture of her work and its impacts. The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. As the winner of Cornell’s competition, Sundstrom will now go on to compete in northeast regional competitions. “Our Three Minute Thesis final round is a highlight of the year for those of us in the Graduate School—literally we talk about it all year long,” said Kathryn J. Boor, dean of the Graduate School and vice provost for graduate education. “We look forward to it because it’s just plain fun, and it’s an opportunity for us to watch and learn from our accomplished and creative graduate researchers.” “I could not possibly be more proud of the work we saw,” she said. 2024 3MT Finalists Watch the 2024 Three Minute Thesis final competition .

Symposium Sessions Summer 2019 P2S Symposium Sessions Opening Plenary: Why You Should Be Communicating Your Research With All Audiences Bruce Lewenstein, Ph.D. Professor of science and technology at Cornell University Many funders require you to demonstrate “broader impacts.” That often gets translated to “give public talks.” And learning to communicate with diverse audiences is often sold as a “soft skill” useful no matter what direction your career goes. But a richer reason is that communication is the essence of scholarship. Your research doesn’t become reliable knowledge until multiple audiences have heard it, played with it, reacted to it, engaged with you about it. In the process, you learn to identify what’s important about your work. You also gather information from multiple sources, get new ideas, new perspectives, new insights. Oh, yeah, and along the way you get some useful professional skills and satisfy your funders. Career Panel Discussion: Careers Leveraging Your Communication Skills Ray Jayawardhana, Ph.D. Moderator, dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at Cornell University Oné Pagán, Ph.D. Panelist, professor of biology at West Chester University Melanie Dreyer-Lude, M.F.A.

Panelist, research and instruction librarian at Catherwood Library and lecturer at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University Kate Addleman-Frankel The Gary and Ellen Davis Curator of Photography, Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University Workshop: The Craft of Revision Rachael Cayley, Ph.D. Associate professor at the Graduate Centre for Academic Communication, University of Toronto In this session, we will discuss strategies for revising academic writing. I will begin by framing revision as the most powerful route to better writing. The ability to revise our own writing improves not just the final writing product, but also the writing process. Having a good handle on revision helps us get started with a writing project and then move through the multiple iterations necessary for strong final drafts. We will consider different types of revision and establish the optimal way to sequence the revision process. Throughout this presentation, there will be opportunities to raise writing questions and to practice relevant strategies. Academic writing is a crucial and challenging aspect of the research process; during our time together, we will explore why it is so hard and how revision can help us become more confident writers. Workshop: Communicating Professional Boundaries – When and How You Can Say No! Janna Lamey Assistant dean for graduate student life at Cornell University Marika Nell Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University To manage your most valuable resource, time, you have to balance your professional and personal priorities. Since you cannot do everything, you need to learn when and how to say no. Through small-group discussion, we will describe common barriers associated with saying no and develop a list of criteria to help you determine when to say no. Finally, leave the session with strategies that can help you be more confident and effective in the art of saying no to others.

June 4, 2020 Part II (11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.) Workshop: Facing an Uncertain Future Without Losing Yourself Mia Tootill, M.A. ’13, Ph.D. ’17 (musicology), LMSW, CMT-P, psychotherapist and mindfulness teacher Session Summary: With many challenges upon us, it is easy to lose our drive and desire, forgo meaningful connections with others, and question everything around us. Being a graduate student today can be particularly overwhelming, due to the already tenuous nature of the job market, the ever-pervasive “imposter syndrome”, and increased unknowns of how academia will be affected by the coronavirus crisis. It has become more important than ever to be able to see ourselves in a more expansive way, not solely as academics or defined by our intelligence, but as humans who each have unique contributions to share with the world. From this viewpoint, we can approach the future from a place of strength and resilience, knowing that we can face whatever obstacles arise. Join alumna and psychotherapist Dr. Mia Tootill who will take us through an interactive and reflective process to reaffirm our core selves and to address common blocks to validating our self-worth and overcoming the shame spiral. She will offer tools from psychological and mindfulness research and speak from her own personal and professional experiences as someone who navigated these challenges successfully herself and is now helping others do the same. If you are interested more specifically in psychotherapy as a profession, Dr. Tootill will be available after the talk from 12:00 – 12:30 p.m. to answer questions about career transitions. Part III (1:00 pm – 2:00 pm) Workshop: Reframing Yourself for Your Job Search Denise DiRienzo, Ed.D. experiential program director, Careers Beyond Academia Session Summary: This session will be focused on Ph.D. students and postdocs in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Do you ever wonder how your skills could transfer to multiple career pathways? Bring your computer, spirit of adventure, and a job advertisement or description of your dream job to this workshop where we will explore career options, strategies, and techniques to prepare for employment opportunities in multiple sectors beyond academia.

Once you submit your letter of acceptance, you should withdraw from all pending job searches.

The way you handle such decisions reflects your values, priorities, and ethical/professional conduct and will contribute to your professional reputation.

Offers Delay Your Response Delay Your Response Make sure you know when you need to respond to a job offer. Depending on time of year, most organizations will allow you at least a few weeks, and sometimes even a few months. If that date approaches before you complete interviewing for other positions, you can ask for an extension. But don’t wait until the last minute to request an extension, and provide a date when you will give your final decision. Example: “Thank you for the opportunity to work with (organization) as a (job title). I am very appreciative of and keenly interested in the offer. At the same time, I have committed to several organizations for second interviews, and would like to see these through to completion. I am writing to request a delay in responding until (date) to be able to collect all the information I need to reach this important decision.” Employers are more likely to offer time extensions during the fall semester than during the spring semester.

Veterans Women’s Communities Student Life Programs Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series Perspectives: The Complete Graduate Student Becoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Prepare for Your Career Take Action Evaluate Offers Negotiate a Salary Package Negotiate a Salary Package Don’t assume that you are expected to negotiate a higher salary. But it is not impolite or unprofessional to negotiate if you have legitimate reasons for requesting reconsideration of one or more terms of an offer. If the salary is fair, negotiate on other issues, such as a signing bonus. If you decide to negotiate on salary, suggest a salary range based on national salary surveys. Be prepared to accept the low end of that range for your first job. Use the following resources: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Salary Survey available in the Cornell Career Services library in Barnes Hall Salary calculators, cost of living, and relocation expense estimates available through websites such as salary.com For academic jobs, other negotiable items include: starting date timeline for considering the offer teaching load lab facilities and/or office space early or delayed tenure options moving expenses assistance with spousal employment extra teaching assistant or research assistant support parking expenses What to Say or Do in Negotiations What if an employer asks for your salary requirement or history in a want ad or job posting? Here are some options: Avoid the salary issue altogether. Ignore the request for salary requirement/history. Say your salary requirement is negotiable. State your current salary and say your requirement is negotiable. Say you are earning market value for someone in your field. Or you expect to earn market value for someone with your educational background. Give a range in which the low-end figure is 10% above your current salary. If you don’t give a salary requirement, you may receive a salary-screening phone call: Politely ask what salary range they’re considering for the position: “I know we don’t want to waste each other’s time if we’re far apart on salary. May I ask you, though, what is the range you’re considering at this time for the position?” If they won’t give you a range and won’t schedule the interview unless you give your salary range, respond this way: “Depending on the management philosophy of the company, overtime hours required, training and support available, medical and dental benefits, commuting and travel time, how well it fits with my long-term career goals, and opportunity for advancement, bonuses, commissions, and other profit-sharing type compensation, my salary expectations range from $XX to $YY.” [Give a VERY WIDE range.] “I’m free [X day and time] for an interview. Which time would work for you?” How to handle the early discussion of salary and compensation in a job interview: Employer: “I assume you’ve seen our advertised salary range. Are you willing to accept a salary within that range?” Delaying tactics: “I applied for this position because I am very interested in the job and your company, and I know I can make an immediate impact once on the job, but I’d like to table salary discussions until we are both sure I’m right for the job.” Employer: “What would it take for you to accept a job offer with us?” Non-specific response: “As long as you pay a fair market value, and the responsibilities fit my skill level, we’ll have no problem.” OR “I feel my salary should be based on the responsibilities of the job and the standards of the industry.” Employer: “If you were to receive a job offer from us, would you accept it?” Throw it back to the employer: “While I’m very interested in the job and the company, it really depends on the offer. What would a person with my background, skills, and qualifications typically earn in this position with your company?” When salary is raised in the middle of the interview: thank the employer for the offer, but be non-committal. There are four possible responses based on the offer: The salary range is acceptable: “I really appreciate the confidence you have in making this job offer to me. I want to bring my talents and skills to work for this organization. Those figures you mentioned are within my expected starting range, depending on the entire salary and benefits package.” Only the top of the salary range is acceptable: “Thanks so much for asking me to be a part of your team. I know my unique mix of skills and abilities will be a great benefit to the organization. Based upon my research and/or what I’ve been discussing with other companies that are currently interested in me, I would have to say that only the upper end of that range would be acceptable.” The entire salary range is unacceptable:“Thank you so much for the offer. I want to bring my skills and talents to your organization. Based upon my research, I would anticipate a salary somewhat higher than that range and/or the other companies I am currently speaking with are considering me at a salary somewhat higher than that range. Of course, money is only one element, and I will be evaluating each overall package.” The interviewer doesn’t give a salary range, and asks what kind of salary it would take for you to accept the position: “From my research, $X is around the base level for salary for this type of position. Considering my experience or expertise in (what do you have that the company values or what can you contribute and how will that benefit the company?), I believe I’m worth mid-range, say $Y to $Z.  What can you do in that area?” When salary is raised at the end of the interview (it means the employer is very interested in hiring you), there are two options: “I’m ready to consider your best offer.” “I would encourage you to make the formal offer. What is most important is the opportunity to work for you and your company. I am confident your offer will be competitive.” When the Official Salary Offer Is Made Start with enthusiasm: “Thanks so much for asking me to be a part of your team. I know my unique mix of skills and abilities will be a great benefit to the organization.” Ask by when they need a decision; if you need more time, negotiate this immediately! Ask for the offer in writing if not offered. End with enthusiasm. Let the negotiation begin! Depending on timeline, after the initial offer call if made, call back after the initial written offer has arrived and ask questions that have not yet been answered (if not found via research, discussed in the interview, or part of the offer letter and materials) and that are of interest/concern to you. About the company: How have past market trends affected the company’s growth and progress? What decreases in productivity and employee layoffs has the company experienced within the past three years? What production and employee cutbacks do you anticipate in the future, and how will they affect this position? When did the company last reorganize, and how did that reorganization affect this position? When do you project the next reorganization of this company, and how do you believe it will affect this position? About the salary package and position: Will compensation time or pay be given for weekend responsibilities and overtime? Are performance and salary reviews based on standard raises for all employees or determined by individual performance? How often are performance and salary reviews conducted? How does the company recognize, evaluate, and reward outstanding employees? What standards will the company use to evaluate my contributions, productivity, and effectiveness? What is the salary range for this position? What is the hiring range for this position? Do you ever pay higher than that range? If so, for what reasons? What kind of salary progression would be expected in the first three to five years?  OR What is the average increase being given? After one year? Two years? Three years? What are the promotional opportunities of this position? To what position/level? OR Based on my maximum productivity, how long do you foresee me fulfilling this position, and what are the possible titles and responsibilities I might assume when my position changes? Does the company have an official policy on internal promotions? What potential career paths within the company might someone entering this position pursue? What is the complete compensation package for an employee at my level? If you decide the official offer is unacceptable: “I am still very interested in working with you and for your company, but at this point I am not able to accept the offer for the following reasons . . . If you were able to . . . I would gladly accept the position immediately. Are you in a position to help?” If you decide the offer is acceptable, but you’d like to sweeten the pot: “I would like to accept your offer, and I’m looking forward to working with you and becoming a valuable member of the team.” [Wait for positive response.] “I am committed to working with you, and since you are my future boss, I have [some] minor issues I wanted to make you aware of. I don’t know if you’re able to make changes in these areas, but I’d surely appreciate your looking into the possibility. Would it be possible to . . .?”  (Provide reasoning if possible.) If they say no, you can say: “How close can you come to my offer? Can we talk about it to figure out a way for us both to be happy?” Going back and forth: Begin and end EVERY call with enthusiasm! Take notes and summarize at the end of each encounter. When the Decision Has Been Made Once you are finished negotiating, get the offer in writing and submit your acceptance in writing highlighting the terms of your acceptance based on what was negotiated. If you don’t reach an agreement and turn down the job, send a letter of appreciation.

Before accepting a job offer, take a realistic look at the organization’s culture and work environment and factors in the local community. Ask yourself these questions: Do I feel comfortable with my supervisor and the people I have met? What formal training program and educational opportunities are there? How much travel is involved? What is the typical career path after the first or second year? What are the long-term advancement opportunities? Would my job responsibilities be building blocks for the future? Where are other branches of the organization located? Would I have the opportunity (or requirement) to relocate, and when? What cultural, athletic, and entertainment activities are available in the local community? How close am I to family and friends?

to Success Symposium Summer 2022 Pathways to Success Symposium June 8, 2022 Part I (9:30 am to 11:00 am ET) Opening Plenary: Self-Advocacy and Assertiveness: A How-To Guide for Succeeding at Cornell and Beyond… Dr. Sharon Milgram, Director of Intramural Training and Education, National Institutes of Health View recording of plenary session Session Summary: To successfully navigate the academic structure as a graduate student and postdoc, you must learn how to become an advocate for yourself. As with most skills, understanding yourself is essential to determine what is most important to you. Equally important to being a self-advocate is to learn how to assert yourself. Regardless of where you land as a professional, self-advocacy and assertiveness are skills primed to help support you in your future career aspirations. Join us for what will be an investment of time that will help you think through your strengths and weaknesses to help you develop as a researcher/scholar in working with other people in systems of power and hierarchy. The session with Dr. Milgram will provide some background information, opportunities to learn more about yourself, and a chance for open discussion with peers. Speaker Bio: Dr. Sharon Milgram received a B.S. degree in physical therapy from Temple University and a Ph.D. in cell biology from Emory University. She completed postdoctoral training at The Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, she rose to the rank of full professor in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. Dr. Milgram served as the associate director of the Medical Scientist Training Program, director of the Interdisciplinary Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, and the director of the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience. In 2007 she joined the NIH Office of the Director as the director of the Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) where she directs a trans-NIH Office dedicated to the career advancement of over 5,000 trainees. Dr. Milgram lectures widely on science careers, mentorship, leadership, management, wellness, and resilience in research environments. She lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with her wife and son. Part II (11:30 am to 1:30 pm ET) Interactive Keynote Session: Claim Your Space – Transformative Communication Skills for Academia and Beyond Eliza VanCort, Best-Selling Author, Speaker, Thought Leader, and Teacher Session Summary: The story your physicality and voice tells can clearly project confidence and strength, or send messages which undermine your effectiveness at work and in life. Eliza’s proprietary methodology empowers people to claim space through enhanced actionable communication skills. This results in more equitable collaborations, and confident, innovative thought leadership. Speaker Bio: Eliza VanCort is a best-selling author, speaker, thought leader, and teacher. Her b est-selling book (#1 on Amazon’s Best Sellers List), “ A Woman’s Guide To Claiming Space: Stand Tall, Raise Your Voice, Be Heard “ offers a “how-to” for a fuller life with actionable tools – from posture to imposter syndrome, interruptions to mansplaining, anti-mentors to cheerleaders, and everything in between! Eliza’s speaking engagements and workshops cover a wide variety of topics, including voice, body language, intersectionality, claiming space, whiteness, allyship, and more to create an environment where folks can talk authentically and build community within and outside of their respective organizations. Part III (2:00 pm to 3:30 pm ET) Workshop: Resilience in Writing – The Key to Graduate Writer Wellbeing and Success Dr. Lisa Russell-Pinson, Associate Teaching Professor of Writing, Center for Graduate Life, the Graduate School, UNC Charlotte Session Summary: When graduate students think about improving their writing, their attention typically turns to ensuring that their texts have well-supported arguments, clear organization, and logical transitions. While these are essential components of effective academic texts, another aspect of writing is just as—or perhaps even more—vital to graduate writing success: writer well-being. Writer well-being includes the “long-term, optimal social and emotional health” of writers (Cochran & Miller-Cochran, 2019), and recent studies point to writer well-being as integral to academic achievement and satisfaction. One hallmark of writer well-being is the ability to respond resiliently to challenges in writing (Russell-Pinson & Harris, 2019; Russell-Pinson, forthcoming). Drawing from the research on writing and well-being, this interactive session will introduce writers to concrete ways of building resilience in their own academic writing processes to bolster their academic achievement and satisfaction in graduate school. Speaker Bio: Lisa Russell-Pinson, Ph.D. is associate teaching professor of writing in the Graduate School at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In this role, she teaches writing classes to matriculated graduate students and develops and delivers support programming for doctoral writers. Dr. Russell-Pinson’s current research focuses on doctoral students’ experiences in the dissertation process, especially factors that impede dissertation-writing progress and interventions that help writers succeed. Her most recent work on academic writing has been published in the Journal of Second Language Writing (2019), Learning from the Lived Experiences of Graduate Student Writers (2020), and Mentorship in Scholarly Publication: Narratives and Practices (forthcoming). Dr. Russell-Pinson earned her B.A. cum laude in English from the University of South Carolina at Columbia and her M.S. and Ph.D. in linguistics from Georgetown University. She has taught English in the U.S. and varied settings abroad, including the Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Slovakia, and Spain. Based on her professional experience and expertise, Dr. Russell-Pinson was selected as an English Language Program Specialist by the U.S. Department of State in 2022. Sponsored by the Graduate School , the English Language Support Office (ELSO) , Cornell Career Services , and the Office of Postdoctoral Studies Participating Graduate School offices: Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement , Academic and Student Affairs , Graduate Student Life , Careers Beyond Academia , and Future Faculty and Academic Careers .

Offers Evaluate Offers You will probably be pleased when you receive a job offer—whether it’s a good job in industry or the government, a postdoc, an academic research position, or a tenure-track position. But even if the offer is appealing, don’t accept the position without considering your professional and personal goals. Talk to a Cornell career advisor if you need help. For most early-career positions, you should weigh the work itself, the level of responsibility, and the opportunity for learning new skills more heavily than the initial salary. Advancement opportunities can make an initial salary differential negligible within a few years. Here’s some help to guide you through the process.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Prepare for Your Career Take Action Interviews Interviews Job interviews are a critical step in the hiring process. If employers invite you to interview, it means they liked what they saw in your resume, CV, letters, research statement, etc. An interview allows you and the employer to meet and assess each other. In an interview, the employer will evaluate your: abilities and skills that match the job requirements. accomplishments. personal attributes. enthusiasm to work for this employer in this position. short- and long-term goals. Interview for Non-Academic Positions To learn more about interviewing for non-academic positions, visit the Career Services website . Interview Types for Academic Positions For some fields, the conference interview is a prerequisite for being invited to campus for an academic position. A conference interview is conducted by someone at a conference. This person may or may not be the person ultimately hiring you. Conference interviews are typically brief (about 30 minutes) but may be longer, so do not schedule interviews back to back. Focus on conveying the important information you want this person to take back to the campus search committee. Also realize that this person may see you throughout the conference and may be observing you. Search Committee Interviews These often are used to select academic candidates and sometimes to make hiring decisions. When interviewing with a search committee, direct your responses to all members of the group. You may begin by making eye contact with the person who asked you the question, but then make eye contact with others as you elaborate. Even if some members of the committee are quiet, they are still evaluating you. To involve everyone in the group, ask questions relevant to each member. One suggestion is to ask members how their position interacts with your position. Academic Mock Interview Questions Why do you especially want to teach at Nameless College or University?

How do you like having required core courses? What’s this statistics core course like from a student perspective? How big are the classes? Teaching Do you have time to do your own research when you’re teaching? How much teaching does the average student do? Do you get trained? If so, how? Would there be interest in seminars to improve teaching methods? Can you take a more active role in teaching, if you want to? Research Training How many of you had M.S. degrees when you started here? How many of you had research experience as undergrads or as technicians? Do you feel like you’re exposed to sufficient techniques here? Is there support to get training elsewhere if it’s not available here? Do you have enough computers/equipment to get your research done? What do you need that I could buy with startup funds to help the community? Do you have enough time to do your research if you’re also teaching? Details Do alumni come back and tell you about life after graduation? Questions to Prepare to Answer One applicant was given these four topics in advance: Future research plans: what directions do you see your research taking in the next five–10 years? What will be the topic of your first major research proposal as a new faculty member, and where will you submit it? What balance do you anticipate between field research and lab/office-based research? If field work will be important, what field sites would you want to consider in the first few years? Education: Given our curriculum needs within the X group, how will you contribute to the undergraduate and graduate curricula? In particular, what graduate course(s) would you like to teach, and what will be your basic teaching model (e.g. lecture, lecture + lab, discussion, etc.)? Graduate and undergraduate research: How will you engage graduate and undergraduate students in your research program? That is, what style of advising/mentoring will you use? Resources: What critical resources do you need in order to establish a successful research program? What critical resources may already be here? What kind of help would you want from the X group, the department, and the university for you to achieve your goals? From Everham & Smallridge, ESA Bulletin Dec 1994: What is the main point of your dissertation? What are your professional goals? What is your concept of teaching in a four-year college as opposed to a research university? What specific research will you pursue if you are selected? How do you anticipate funding it? How has your experience and training prepared you to teach the courses required? What other courses might you teach? Why do you want this job? Why should we hire YOU? What strengths would you bring to the department? What would you expect from this department and administration? What kind of start-up funds, facilities, and equipment would you need? What experiences or interests do you have in college-wide activities and service? From an underground primer by Peter Kareiva (UW–Seattle) and Dan Doak (UC–Santa Cruz): What research will you be doing when you show up here? What projects will you start next? Why would you want to come here? What teaching would you like to do? What is your philosophy of grad student training? How will you support students? What types of projects do you expect them to work on? What will you contribute to the department that is not already well covered by the faculty? What makes you think you could ever get any outside funding? What is the best idea you ever had? What do you do? (the three to five minute summary of your entire research agenda) Where do you see your work going in the next 10–20 years? From an underground list of questions used by graduate students at the University of Arizona: What kinds of tools would be available in your lab for grad student use? In what areas do you think your work would uniquely contribute to this department? With whom in the department do you envision interacting the most? Outside the department? What meetings do you attend? What societies do you belong to? What do you envision as your ideal lab: # grads, undergrads, postdocs, techs, participation of grads who are not your own students? To what degree do you see integrating grad students into your research program? Is their work usually closely related to your research focus or is it fairly independent? How do you help grad students get started on a project? What’s your perspective on grad student funding? How would you respond to a student who is floundering (early vs. late)? What types of mentoring have you experienced—and what would you do similarly or differently? What courses have you taught before? What do you see as the major challenges of teaching at a large (small) university? What do you want to teach? (grad, undergrad, seminars) Statistics? Questions that Might Catch You Off Guard The illegal questions: spouses, children, etc. For example: Will anything need to be done for your spouse/partner (like find them a job)? Would you take this job if it were offered to you? How would you handle an interpersonal conflict in your lab? What happened in a break-up between two members of the lab who were involved? How to Respond If faced with a potentially discriminatory question during an employment interview, you are under no obligation to provide an answer. Be aware that such questions might be examples of stress questions, and you should be prepared to respond to them. Based on your personal preference and experience, you may choose to answer such questions briefly, but you should understand that volunteering such information may have negative consequences. Understanding the employer’s concern, however, might help you to structure a response. Indirect Response Address the employer’s underlying concern without directly answering the question. If an employer asks a question about your plans for marriage or family, the underlying concern is likely to be your ability to travel or to be at work during business hours, or your commitment to remain with the organization. Although you need not answer the question directly, you might acknowledge the employer’s concern and give assurance that your personal life will not interfere with your career responsibilities. Example: “I understand that you are concerned about my abilities to carry out the responsibilities of this position, and I assure you I will be able to.” Direct Response A more direct but less comfortable response is to mention your concern that the issue has no apparent bearing on your qualifications or ability to do the job. You may ask for clarification of the reason such information is requested or how it relates to the job discussed. Example: “It’s not clear to me why you are asking about this. Can you please explain?” Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Philosophy Statement Teaching Philosophy Statement What is a teaching philosophy statement? A teaching philosophy statement is a narrative that includes: your conception of teaching and learning. a description of how you teach. justification for why you teach that way. The statement can: demonstrate that you have been reflective and purposeful about your teaching. communicate your goals as an instructor and your corresponding actions in the classroom. point to and tie together the other sections of your portfolio. What is the purpose of a teaching philosophy statement? You generally need a teaching statement to apply for an academic position. A teaching statement: conveys your teaching values, beliefs, and goals to a broader audience. provides a set of criteria and/or standards to judge the quality of your teaching. provides evidence of your teaching effectiveness. Components of a teaching philosophy statement educational purpose and learning goals for students your teaching methods methods for assessing students’ learning assessment of teaching You also may include: a list of courses you have taught. samples of course syllabi. teaching evaluations. letters of recommendation. a video of a class you have taught (asked for by some universities). Teaching values, beliefs, and goals You should consider what you believe is the end goal or purpose of education: content mastery engaged citizenry individual fulfillment critical thinking problem solving discovery and knowledge generation teamwork self-directed learning experiential learning What criteria are used to judge your teaching? student-teaching roles and responsibilities student-teacher interaction inclusiveness teaching methods assessment of teaching assessment of learning How do you provide evidence of your teaching effectiveness? peer review students’ comments ratings portfolio syllabi teaching activities Writing guidelines: There is no required content, set format, or right or wrong way to write a teaching statement. That is why writing one can be challenging. Make the length suit the context. Generally, they are one to two pages. Use present tense and the first person, in most cases. Avoid technical terms and use broadly understood language and concepts, in most cases. Write with the audience in mind. Have someone from your field guide you on discipline-specific jargon and issues to include or exclude. Include teaching strategies and methods to help people “see” you in the classroom. Include specific examples of your teaching strategies, assignments, discussions, etc. Help them to visualize the learning environment you create and the exchanges between you and your students. Make it memorable and unique. The search committee is seeing many of these documents—What is going to set you apart? What will they remember? Your teaching philosophy will come to life if you create a vivid portrait of yourself as a person who is intentional about teaching practices and committed to your career. “Own” your philosophy Don’t make general statements such as “students don’t learn through lecture” or “the only way to teach is with class discussion.” These could be detrimental, appearing as if you have all of the answers. Instead, write about your experiences and your beliefs. You “own” those statements and appear more open to new and different ideas about teaching. Even in your own experience, you make choices about the best teaching methods for different courses and content: sometimes lecture is most appropriate; other times you may use service-learning, for example. Teaching philosophy statement dos and don’ts: Don’t give idyllic but empty concepts. Don’t repeat your CV. Do research on the teaching institution and disciplinary trends. Do keep it short (one to two pages). Do provide concrete examples and evidence of usefulness of teaching concepts. Do discuss impact of methods, lessons learned, challenges, and innovations—how did students learn? Do discuss connections between teaching, research, and service. Answer these questions to get started: The purpose of education is to________. Why do you want to teach your subject? Students learn best by______________. When you are teaching your subject, what are your goals? The most effective methods for teaching are___________. I know this because__________________. The most important aspects of my teaching are______________. More information on teaching philosophy statements An excellent guide for writing your teaching philosophy statement is Occasional Paper number 23, “Writing a Statement of Teaching Philosophy for the Academic Job Search,” from the University of Michigan’s Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, which you can find at this page on The Teaching Philosophy and Statement .

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Prepare for Your Career Take Action Research Statement Research Statement What is a Research Statement? The research statement (or statement of research interests) is a common component of academic job applications. It is a summary of your research accomplishments, current work, and future direction and potential of your work. The statement can discuss specific issues such as: funding history and potential requirements for laboratory equipment and space and other resources potential research and industrial collaborations how your research contributes to your field future direction of your research The research statement should be technical, but should be intelligible to all members of the department, including those outside your subdiscipline. So keep the “big picture” in mind. The strongest research statements present a readable, compelling, and realistic research agenda that fits well with the needs, facilities, and goals of the department. Research statements can be weakened by: overly ambitious proposals lack of clear direction lack of big-picture focus inadequate attention to the needs and facilities of the department or position Why a Research Statement? It conveys to search committees the pieces of your professional identity and charts the course of your scholarly journey. It communicates a sense that your research will follow logically from what you have done and that it will be different, important, and innovative. It gives a context for your research interests—Why does your research matter? The so what? It combines your achievements and current work with the proposal for upcoming research. Helps hiring committees assess: areas of specialty and expertise potential to get funding academic strengths and abilities compatibility with the department or school ability to think and communicate like a serious scholar and/or scientist Formatting of Research Statements The goal of the research statement is to introduce yourself to a search committee, which will probably contain scientists both in and outside your field, and get them excited about your research. To encourage people to read it: make it one or two pages, three at most use informative section headings and subheadings use bullets use an easily readable font size make the margins a reasonable size Organization of Research Statements Think of the overarching theme guiding your main research subject area. Write an essay that lays out: The main theme(s) and why it is important and what specific skills you use to attack the problem. A few specific examples of problems you have already solved with success to build credibility and inform people outside your field about what you do. A discussion of the future direction of your research. This section should be really exciting to people both in and outside your field. Don’t sell yourself short; if you think your research could lead to answers for big important questions, say so! A final paragraph that gives a good overall impression of your research. Writing Research Statements Style: Avoid jargon. Make sure that you describe your research in language that many people outside your specific subject area can understand. Ask people both in and outside your field to read it before you send your application. A search committee won’t get excited about something they can’t understand. Write as clearly, concisely, and concretely as you can. Keep it at a summary level; give more detail in the job talk. Ask others to proofread it. Be sure there are no spelling errors. Content: Convince the search committee not only that you are knowledgeable, but that you are the right person to carry out the research. Include information that sets you apart (e.g., publication in Science, Nature, or a prestigious journal in your field). What excites you about your research? Sound fresh. Include preliminary results and how to build on results. Point out how current faculty may become future partners. Acknowledge the work of others. Use language that shows you are an independent researcher. BUT focus on your research work, not yourself. Include potential funding partners and industrial collaborations. Be creative! Provide a summary of your research. Put in background material to give the context/relevance/significance of your research. List major findings, outcomes, and implications. Describe both current and planned (future) research. Communicate a sense that your research will follow logically from what you have done and that it will be unique, significant, and innovative (and easy to fund). Describe Your Future Goals or Research Plans Major problem(s) you want to focus on in your research. The problem’s relevance and significance to the field. Your specific goals for the next three to five years, including potential impact and outcomes. If you know what a particular agency funds, you can name the agency and briefly outline a proposal. Give broad enough goals so that if one area doesn’t get funded, you can pursue other research goals and funding. Identify Potential Funding Sources Almost every institution wants to know whether you’ll be able to get external funding for research. Try to provide some possible sources of funding for the research, such as NIH, NSF, foundations, private agencies. Mention past funding, if appropriate. Be Realistic There is a delicate balance between a realistic research statement where you promise to work on problems you really think you can solve and over-reaching or dabbling in too many subject areas. Select an over-arching theme for your research statement and leave miscellaneous ideas or projects out. Everyone knows that you will work on more than what you mention in this statement. Consider Also Preparing a Longer Version A longer version (five–15 pages) can be brought to your interview. (Check with your advisor to see if this is necessary.) You may be asked to describe research plans and budget in detail at the campus interview. Be prepared. Include laboratory needs (how much budget you need for equipment, how many grad assistants, etc.) to start up the research. Samples of Research Statements To find sample research statements with content specific to your discipline, search on the internet for your discipline + “Research Statement.” University of Pennsylvania Sample Research Statement Advice on writing a Research Statement (Plan) from the journal Science Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Prepare for Your Career Take Action Resumes and CVs Resumes and CVs Depending on the type of job, you will need to create a curriculum vitae (CV) or a resume. Both documents put your qualification in writing, but they are used for different audiences and use a different format. When to use a Resume In the United States, most employers use resumes for non-academic positions, which are one or two page summaries of your experience, education, and skills.  Employers rarely spend more than a few minutes reviewing a resume, and successful resumes are concise with enough white space on the page to make it easy to scan. For more information on developing your resume, please visit Cornell Career Services’ Career Development Toolkit . Students often find it helpful to review resumes from graduate students who got their first job outside of academe. When to use a Curriculum Vitae (CV) A CV is a longer synopsis of your educational and academic background as well as teaching and research experience, publications, awards, presentations, honors, and additional details. CVs are used when applying for academic, scientific, or research positions. International employers often use CVs as well. A CV is a comprehensive statement emphasizing: professional qualifications education experience accomplishments activities special qualifications A CV can vary from two pages to several pages. Professionals seeking academic positions and non-academic positions in science, higher education, research, and health care typically use a CV. It is also used to seek a fellowship or grant and is expected for some positions overseas. Consult with faculty members in your field to determine what is expected and appropriate for your field. Guidelines for Preparing a CV The order of topics in a CV format is flexible. Arrange sections to highlight strengths for the position you are seeking. Elaborate on accomplishments and skills within categories. List items within each category chronologically, the most recent appearing first. Include additional headings when appropriate to reflect certifications/licensures, workshops/training, languages, book reviews, etc. Present information in an easily accessible and attractive style. Resources Faculty advisors are the most knowledgeable resource for determining what constitutes effective content in your discipline. For formatting assistance and to see more examples of  CVs, visit the Cornell Career Services Library in 103 Barnes Hall. The following books also may help: How to Prepare Your Curriculum Vitae and The Curriculum Vitae Handbook . Sample CVs Non-academic samples from the University of California, San Francisco Academic samples from the University of California, San Francisco Samples from Columbia University Samples from University of Pennsylvania Chronicle of Higher Education’s CV Doctor Electronic Version of CV When sending electronic versions, attach a file or cut and paste the CV into the text of the email message. State your objectives and career interests in the first few lines since they may be the only items seen on a screen. Other tips: Use language and acronyms recognized in your field. Avoid using bold, italics, underlining, lines, or graphics. Use all caps for emphasis. Put your name at the top followed by address and each phone number on a separate line. Many employers use websites for applicants to apply for positions. Although each form may be different, some elements may be similar. Save parts of your CV in a format that can be cut and pasted for each individual web-based form, such as saving a bulleted list of work experience. Transforming Your CV into a Resume You may need both a CV and a resume for your job search. Sending the appropriate document (CV or resume) tells employers that you can distinguish the differences between the academic and non-academic environments and that you can adapt your skills to either environment. Most employers in industry prefer a resume. When rearranging your CV to make it a resume: Do not exceed two pages. Re-evaluate your experience. Think creatively about how your academic experience can be translated into the necessary skills for a non-academic environment. Consider skills of project management, leadership, teamwork, effective communication, and meeting deadlines. Choose action verbs to describe your experience. Put your strengths first. List your professional experience or your degree first, depending on which is most important for a specific position. Include a well-written job objective; state the type of position and work setting you are seeking, skills or abilities you possess, and long-term goals. Be sure that your resume supports your job objective. Emphasize skills and accomplishments. List relevant presentations, publications, and papers, but not all. Have someone proofread it.

Present Your Key Skills to an Employer Present Your Key Skills to an Employer If you’ve browsed job listings outside academia recently, you may have noticed that few require advanced degrees or academic skills (e.g. research or teaching skills) in the job description. This does not necessarily mean you are not qualified. Employers outside academia look for a core set of competencies, abilities, experiences, and values that a candidate can bring to their organization. So, what should you do? The short of it is that YOU DO have valuable transferable skills that build upon and extend beyond teaching or research! You help employers see the unique set of transferable skills that might make you the perfect candidate for a position. The following steps will help you identify, develop, and communicate your transferable skills! Step 1: Identify your transferable skills and make a list of your experiences, including those outside the classroom. Review lists of transferable skills. Become familiar with the transferable skills employers are commonly seeking in their ideal candidates. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) provides a list of Career Readiness Competencies , which is great starting point! This list was developed with input from over 600 different U.S. employers. Under the Build Your Skills focus area, the Graduate School’s Pathways to Success webpages also provide details on the types of transferable skills graduate students should seek to develop. Review job advertisements in a field you are interested in pursuing. This helps you figure out which transferable skills are considered more important than others in specific fields or for specific positions. Make a list of all of your experience. Expand the definition of “experience” by including your volunteer work (e.g., service to your department, student organization engagement, mentoring undergraduates, etc.) and any freelance work you may have done inside or outside of academia. Step 2: Develop your transferable skills and experiences to match your identified lists. Seek volunteer opportunities . Experiences as a volunteer can fill some of the gaps that may exist between your existing experience and the experience and skills your desired position may require. Attend workshops that supplement your list of transferable skills. Workshops can add valuable skills to your resume. The Pathways to Success website includes a list of transferable skills and workshops that develop these skills, including programs on leadership. Step 3: Communicate transferable skills and experiences by preparing a resume (which is different from CV!) that highlights your experience and transferable skills, then make updating it a monthly exercise! Focus on bulleting your previous and current experience. This will help you recognize how your graduate training supports the development of a diversity of skills beyond research and teaching. This Inside Higher Ed article provides great strategies on how to accomplish this. Become familiar with the lingo of an industry sector that you are interested in pursuing. Use that lingo to reframe your resume in way that is recognizable to people in that sector. Meet a graduate career advisor at Cornell Career Services . A graduate career advisor can help ensure that your application materials clearly communicate your transferable skills and experiences. Explore LinkedIn profiles of professionals . LinkedIn provides immediate access to how people in fields and positions of interest to you (especially the experience section) present their transferable skills. This information can help generate ideas for your own application materials and LinkedIn profile. Review your resume and other materials: Make sure that your most relevant transferable skills are clearly highlighted in your resume and cover letter in a way that will be easily understood by hiring managers.

While you have been navigating academia, building your skills, and creating your plan, you have been preparing simultaneously for your career. The Cornell Career Services (CCS) Career Development model has three stages—understand yourself, explore options, and take action—and the resources at the links below will provide guidance as you navigate all three stages. In addition to these resources, Cornell Career Services has a Career Development Toolkit (self-enroll in Canvas). 1. Understand Yourself Self-knowledge is the foundation of a career decision-making process because you need to reflect on what you are good at (abilities), what you care about (values), and what you like to do (interest) in order to recognize what career opportunities best fit you. Discover your interests, values, and skills to develop self-knowledge 2. Explore Options Exploring career options involves gaining knowledge related to occupations/fields of interest, and an awareness of education and employment trends in these fields. You will need to conduct research, develop a network, and engage in activities and internships to identify career options that match who you are. Explore the many career options that might be a match for you 3. Take Action If you have already thought about your career interests and researched your options, it is time to apply to positions! Information collected from the previous two steps will help you to take action to get to your desired career. You will need to prepare resumes, letters, applications, and practice your interviewing skills to help you achieve your career goals and land that job. Take action to achieve your desired career goals 4. Find Campus Offices for Career Help Check in with your graduate field office to learn what services are offered. Further, career services for graduate and professional students and postdocs are provided by a network of offices and resources across campus and online.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Create Your Plan Create Your Plan To be successful both in graduate school and beyond, it is important to: define your priorities; identify resources and areas of development; develop goals and a timeline; follow through with your plan; reflect on your achievements and growth; and reevaluate your plan periodically to make adjustments as your interests, skills, and goals evolve. Cornell has a range of resources to help you with every step in this process—such as personal assessments or a goal-setting tool called an individual development plan (IDP)—which are listed in more detail below. Cornell Resources to Help You Create Your Plan Self-Assessments All graduate students are encouraged to meet with a Cornell career advisor to take an assessment to understand their personality, interests, values, and career goals. Postdocs may discuss their interests, values, and career goals with Christine Holmes ( ch18@cornell.edu ), director of the Office of Postdoctoral Studies. Find assessments available to all graduate students . Find free online assessments available to all students and postdocs . Ask yourself reflection questions to identify your career goals, interests, and skills. External Resources Individual Development Plan (IDP) The IDP is an excellent tool for self-assessment and developing goals for yourself during your academic years and beyond. Although you can create your IDP by yourself, graduate students and postdocs often find that co-developing their IDP with their faculty mentor is a good way to ensure there is awareness and support of their career plans. IDPs for humanities and social science fields: Imagine Ph.D. (all fields in the humanities and social sciences) University of Wisconsin-Madison (all fields) American Psychological Association University of Southern California Postdoctoral Office (for postdocs in all fields but could be used for graduate students) IDPs for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields: ScienceCareers myIDP (all STEM fields) University of Wisconsin-Madison (all fields) University of Southern California Postdoctoral Office (for postdocs in all fields but could be used for graduate students) American Chemical Society (for chemical scientists) Stanford University Biosciences (for bioscience fields) Books, References Do What You Are: Discover the Perfect Career For You Through the Secrets of Personality Type by Paul Tieger (available in 103 Barnes Hall and Cornell Library System) So What Are You Going To Do With That?

Leadership Opportunities Colman Leadership Program for Ph.D. Students In spring 2012, John and Jane Colman established the Colman Family Endowed Fund for Leadership within Diversity Programs in Engineering (DPE) to establish the Colman Leadership Program for Ph.D. students in engineering and other related STEM fields. In summer 2015, the Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement established a partnership with DPE to launch a June offering of the Colman Leadership Program open to Ph.D. and M.F.A. students from across all graduate fields. Every January and June, the Colman Leadership Program seeks to enroll up to 30 students in an intensive four-day program focused on providing participants with skills and knowledge that will support their development as leaders in graduate school and beyond. Although students with the fellowships and affiliations listed below receive priority consideration for enrollment in the program, the Colman Leadership program has the capacity to serve a broader base of students. Therefore, students from all backgrounds ( domestic and international) and disciplines are strongly encouraged to apply. Cornell Colman Fellowship Cornell Sloan Fellowship Cornell GEM Ph.D. Fellowship Dean’s Excellence Fellowship SUNY Diversity Fellowship McNair Graduate Fellowship Mellon Mays Graduate Fellowship Provost Diversity Fellowship Bouchet Honor Society Program Goals The Colman Leadership Program introduces students to a range of practical skills, theory pertaining to leadership, and special topics relevant for application in both academic and professional contexts. With a varied format including readings, interactive group activities, case studies, discussions, student presentations, and professionally conducted workshop sessions, program participants will learn about leadership, develop practical skills for negotiation and conflict resolution, and discuss modes of translating collaborative teamwork and the positive, productive employment of the diverse perspectives and backgrounds students bring to the program. Specifically, program participants focus on the following: Self-awareness as a leadership skill Extending self-awareness to effective interpersonal dynamics Appreciating fundamental group dynamics Understanding how to create teams from groups Appreciating diversity in all contexts Differentiating between role authority and leadership in an organizational context Learning skills of integration and synthesis Program Schedule The online application for the January program opens in November while the online application for the June program opens in later April.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Pathways to Success Build Your Skills Tips for TAs Tips for TAs Figuring out how to be a successful teaching assistant while balancing the different elements of graduate school can be tricky. To assist new TAs in this process, we asked current students for their most helpful tips and compiled those tips below. For more resources, visit the summary of teaching-related resources and policies prepared by the Dean of Faculty, the Teaching Resources page of the Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) website, or the Teaching and Mentoring page on the Future Faculty and Academic Careers website. Arts & Humanities “Each semester, I require each student to come to my office hours at least one time as part of their section grade. It offers a great opportunity to get to know students personally. Another graduate student that I shared an office with required students to come to her office within the first few weeks of the semester, but I found that it was more useful for students to come later in the semester–when they have questions about writing a paper or they missed a lecture. I allow students to decide when they want to come in, but I ask them to email me in advance to schedule the meeting within my office hour block. “In advance” can be 10 minutes before office hours start if needed, but they can also schedule it a few weeks before. This means that students don’t waste time in the hallway waiting for me to finish with another student, and it also allows me to structure my own office hour block as I wish. Of course, you have to be in your office and available during the entire office hour period, but you will structure your time differently if you don’t think anyone is coming in, versus knowing that the entire next two hours will be occupied by four 30-minute meetings. It’s just nice to know what you can or can’t get done in the next two hours.” “Some teaching assistants like to meet students in cafes around campus, but I find that meeting in my office is more convenient for me and also allows students to get a better sense of who I am (when they see how I’ve decorated my desk and what books I have on my shelves).” “The first semester that I was a teaching assistant, I required students to meet with me for office hours twice, including meeting whenever they missed a lecture. I found that that was too much for them and me both, so now I just require them to come to my office hours once. Your supervisor may have other expectations, but if he/she doesn’t say anything about it, I would require students to meet for office hours once. This probably varies by field as well.” “Create a short syllabus just for section with your expectations for section, your contact information, and your office hours. Bring it on the first day of section. Use the Johnson Museum for one section if it is relevant to your subject! They love having sections at the museum and can create a custom session that fits the topic of your course.” “On the first day of section, I act very professional and organized. It inspires confidence in the TA, even if the TA does not internally feel much confidence. Later on in the semester, you can loosen up a bit. Asking students how many prelims they have around mid-term, right before section starts, or empathizing with how tired or stressed they might be, is a good way to start a section later on in the semester. But in the first two sections or so, students need to see that you are trustworthy as a professor–that you have it together. In order to like you (not that this is the first priority, but it is important for relationship-building), they need to know first that you are professional, while also being warm and approachable. I think a lot of students have low expectations of teaching assistants, either from past experience or what they’ve heard from others. Having a lesson plan typed out in front of you during the first session (just a list of exactly what you will do and when), a sign-in sheet prepared to pass around for attendance, and copies of a one-page section syllabus will help inspire this confidence in your professionalism and organizational skills.” Amanda “Encourage discussion about questions, rather than lecture or try to get ‘correct’ answers.” “Avoid sarcasm. Do not tell them if you do not study or specialize in the subject you are teaching. If possible, sit down in a group with students, rather than stand behind a lectern. Get advice from professor or other TAs about grading and what is the appropriate level of writing skills for your students.” Anonymous “Learn your students’ names as fast as possible! Download the picture roster Cornell supplies and a spaced-repetition flashcard program, like Anki. Use “Snip” on Windows or Command-Shift-4 on Mac to copy/paste small screenshots of each picture onto flashcards. Study once daily. By day two or three, you’ll be set. And your students will be thrilled. Because of this initial show of respect and investment in them, they will respect you and invest all the more in your class.” Louis Life Science “A lot of new TAs find that grading duties sneak up on them. Treat grading time as if it were another non-negotiable event on your schedule; choose consistent blocks of time to do grading, put them on your calendar, and don’t convince yourself that you can do it later. You will be much less stressed when there’s an hour before the grades are due and everything is already finished.” Andrew “Make sure to double check the grading system and draw boundaries in the syllabus. I had a student come in for seven minutes of a 70-minute class and say there was no cut off detailed in the syllabus for when participation stopped counting due to lateness.” Anonymous “If you are working with a faculty member for the class, make sure you are on the same page with responsibilities, teaching style, teaching content, etc. A lot of faculty have specific standards of how they want the course run, but not all of them will tell you clearly or up front!” “I’ve found acting really enthusiastic in class the first few sessions can help my students feel ok opening up and answering questions in class!” “Time yourself for all tasks related to teaching, including grading and prepping for lectures. When the timer hits the max amount of hours you signed up for, stop for that week!” “Teaching is fun and rewarding but can really take a lot of time away from your research if you are not careful with how much time you allow yourself to put in. “ Elena “Students can get pretty stressed about grades. Keep reminding them that help is available through office hours with the TAs, professor, etc. One reminder at the beginning of the semester is not enough.” Michelle Physical Sciences & Engineering “Be humble enough to know that you are still a student yourself, and realize that over your first semester as a TA you will probably learn just as much as your students do. You will be challenged to think about things from someone else’s perspective, which, in my opinion, is the best way to mature your understanding of any study.” “Don’t talk to the board!” Jason “Be honest with your TA supervisor. If you’re struggling with your workload plus your TA responsibilities, let them know. There may not be anything they can do, but they may also give you some slack.” “Hold yourself to grading your students’ assignments and having it back to them no later than a week after they turn it in. It’ll save you in the long run.” Rachael “Some students will underperform, sometimes a section as a whole might underperform in an exam. Then too, try not to lose your temper – I did so in my first semester, while in subsequent ones I restrained myself a lot – correcting rather than chastising. That made me far more effective as a tutor. ” “Students in big courses treat the homework like a chore. No point expecting them to spend too much time on it. A lot of students who do their homework quickly still perform very well in exams. And they get very upset if you make too big issue about homework performance.” “Interaction – I have a direct style, I always tell the students where they stand, what are their strengths, what are their weaknesses. This earns both praise and criticism.” Shayak Social Sciences “Go to the lectures if possible! A lot of students will want to discuss contents covered during the lecture with you, and it won’t be helpful if you have no idea what they are talking about. “ “Just be honest if you don’t know the answers – students prefer it much more than you’re just making something up. “ “Students will really appreciate it if you can be patient and understanding. Some of them just prefer talking to TAs instead of going to the professor’s office hour, and your help is crucial for them.” Rachel Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Postdoc Position Find a Postdoc Position A postdoc is a person who has received a doctoral degree and is pursuing additional research, training, or teaching to have better skills to pursue a career in academia, research, or other fields. Postdocs work closely with a faculty mentor. Postdocs play a crucial role in the university; they supplement the research expertise of faculty by sharing new techniques, collaborating with other institutions, and helping to manage the daily operations of a laboratory or research site. They also contribute teaching and advising support to undergraduate and graduate students. Consider your long-term goals and why you want to do a postdoc: Do you want to stay in academia or are you looking at industry? Do you want to focus on teaching, research, or a combination of both? Are you getting a postdoc to learn new skills? Are you getting a postdoc to publish? Are you getting a postdoc to develop better teaching skills? Are you getting a postdoc to further develop your existing skills? Prepare for the job search: Develop your CV. You need a strong CV to get a position, so get help writing it from a career counselor in your college or in Career Services in Barnes Hall. This is a very important document, which you will keep updating for the rest of your career. Do mock interviews. Work on your interviewing skills and develop your job talk. Ask your advisor and other faculty members to be your references. Letters of recommendation are a key part of the application process. You need strong references who know you well. Give each reference an updated copy of your CV. Network. Let everyone know that you are looking for a postdoc. For details, go to Resumes and CVs . Talk with your advisor and others to identify universities/labs: Once you know what you hope to accomplish during a postdoc and have made a list of prospective labs, talk to your advisor and other faculty members to shorten this list. Also, talk with postdocs in your department to get their opinions. Investigate the labs/PIs and university: Check out the lab’s most recent publications and the lab’s website. Find out the record of past postdocs/grad students in the lab. Talk with current and former postdocs/grad students about their experiences there, as well as where they are now. Choosing the right PI is vital to your future career. Consider: Is the PI well connected? Does the PI have tenure? Does the PI have a solid record in getting grants? Does the PI have a solid record publishing? Check the university salary and benefit package for postdocs; call the Postdoc Office if they have one. Find out if they offer: health benefits for postdocs and their families retirement benefit career counseling housing (can be essential in a large city) Start applying: Send out your CV and cover letter to the labs you are interested in. If you do not get a reply within a month, follow up with an email. Conferences are a great place to meet PIs and network; so before the conference, contact the PI/labs to schedule an informational meeting. Interview: Before an interview, prepare and practice your presentation. Make your presentation distinctive, interesting, and understandable. Research the universities where you will be interviewing so you can ask informed questions. During the interview, ask questions to make sure this is the right position for you. Talk to other postdocs and grad students in the lab. Send thank you notes after each interview. For details, go to Interviews . Making the decision: By now you should have a good idea of each lab you applied to, and which is the best place for your research. Once you make a decision you need to stay with it, so think carefully before accepting an offer. For details, go to Evaluate Offers . For more information, contact Director of Postdoctoral Studies Christine Holmes ( ch18@cornell.edu ).

chosen to come to graduate school, and specifically Cornell, for many reasons. At the top of that list, your primary focus is academics. Whether you are in a research program and pursuing a doctoral degree or research master’s (M.A., M.S.) or in a professional degree program, navigating the academic requirements and expectations can be much different than your previous experiences. Successful graduate students are engaged, committed, motivated, and proactive. You are self-directed and take action to: learn to productively and professionally interact with faculty, peers, and others seek to understand the terminology, policies, and organizational structures identify and leverage resources to support your progression through and beyond graduate school establish intellectual and social communities and professional networks To navigate your graduate studies, you will need to: understand the graduate field structure, requirements, and policies of Cornell develop realistic expectations, effective habits, and strategies for coursework, research, writing, and your overall well-being create a schedule and timeline for degree completion manage interpersonal dynamics and mentoring relationships know your funding sources and manage them proactively seek fellowships and other funding opportunities respond to and manage (sometimes unanticipated) academic or personal challenges develop and maintain healthy relationships and habits supportive of your progress and success Plan Strategically to be Successful Develop a strategic plan that includes all requirements for your degree delineated by your graduate field and your advisor ( special committee chair for research degree students). Review the graduate faculty’s Code of Legislation . Add to your strategic plan the requirements in this the Code that are administered for the graduate faculty by the Graduate School. Your plan at this point might include choosing an advisor, forming your special committee , scheduling and attempting a Q (qualifying) exam , an M (master’s) exam , the A (pre-dissertation or prospectus) exam , and a B (thesis or dissertation defense) exam . Include a schedule and deadline for completing each requirement and milestone. Your schedule is determined in part by deadlines set by your program and the Graduate School, but also by funding, personal factors, etc. Now you need to work your plan! Identify workshops, programs, online and print resources, and people at Cornell and elsewhere to help you develop the connections and skills you need to successfully implement your plan. Here are some suggestions.

Stanford University: VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab See Bias | Block Bias Tools The VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab at Stanford University generates foundational research to advance women’s leadership by diagnosing barriers and developing and evaluating interventions to get beyond barriers, and disseminates research-based solutions by bridging the gap between research and practice. The lab has a collection of See Bias | Block Bias Tools that include diagnosing bias, assessing performance and potential, block bias, the redesigning, redefining work videobook, and several related video resources. Government of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs Program – Unconscious Bias Training There is overwhelming scientific evidence that unconscious bias may influence peer review and the evaluation and selection of candidates from graduate admissions through faculty hiring. This online unconscious bias training module , provided by the Government of Canada, explains what unconscious bias is, outlines how it can affect the peer review process, and suggests ways to mitigate the influence of unconscious bias. Though focused on peer review, this online module includes content that is transferable to other areas of academia including graduate admissions, postdoc selection, and faculty hiring.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Diversity & Inclusion Faculty Resources Practical Steps for Addressing Inequities & Supporting Belonging Practical Steps for Addressing Inequities & Supporting Belonging The following are practical steps Directors of Graduate Studies, Department Chairs, and other faculty and administrative leadership can take to address inequities and support sense of belonging within graduate fields and academic departments. This is not a comprehensive list, but the actions provided are ones that can help to guide progress as faculty and others seek to support meaningful and positive change. Recognize Trauma and Make Students Feel Validated Silence can be deafening; don’t avoid discussing racism, sexism, heterosexism, abelism, xenophobia, and other ‘isms and phobias, especially when central to incidents that are painful for many students. Go beyond communicating support, identify actions the field or department will take to advance diversity, equity, access, justice, and inclusion. Create space and opportunities for supportive dialogue. Practice phrases such as “I don’t know what you’re going through, but I’ll always be willing to listen and support you in any way I can.” Approach discussions with humility and humanity; actively listen and seek opportunities to demonstrate empathy and compassion. Avoid any situation in which a student might be asked to place their trauma on display for the learning benefit of others. Schedule a My Voice, My Story: Understanding the Untold Lived Experiences of Graduate and Professional Students session for focused audiences of faculty and staff, or graduate students and postdocs. My Voice, My Story sessions pair video monologues – constructed from experiences of Cornell graduate students – with facilitated discussions. The primary objectives of My Voice, My Story are to utilize the power of narrative to achieve greater understanding of the lived experiences of graduate and professional students, share stories that frequently go untold, and develop strategies on how to create more inclusive and supportive research and learning environments. Example Resources: Protecting Student Mental Health in the Face of Antisemitism and Islamophobia Communicating with Students about Racial Violence Out for Allyship Resources Bystander Intervention Training to stop anti-Asian/American and xenophobic harassment Race and Racism Across Borders How to Help Students Cope With Safety Threats Religious Bullying: How to Get Help and Cope How to Cope With Safety Threats in Your Community or the World How to Cope With Traumatic Events Resources for Leading Through Trauma and Crisis Acknowledge & Interrupt Words and Acts of Aggression Learn to recognize, acknowledge, and address when an act of aggression occurs (Though such actions are often termed micro-aggressions, recognize that they are experienced as acts of aggression by those to whom they are directed.) Tools for Recognizing Microaggressions and the Messages They Send Disarming Racial Microaggressions: Microintervention Strategies for Targets, White Allies, and Bystanders A Guide for Responding to Microaggressions How to Respond to Microaggressions Phrases for Responding to Microaggressions and Bias Right to Be Bystander Intervention Training International Students and Experiences with Race in the United States Difficult Dialogues National Resource Center – Talking Across Difference Have a plan in place of how you will respond if faculty, staff, postdocs, students, or invited speakers use language or demonstrate behaviors that are racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory or oppressive. This goes beyond reporting and includes how you will address aggressors, support individuals, and respond to your community. Become comfortable with having discussions about intent versus impact – due to the influence of racism, sexism, and oppressive systems and structures, well-intended words or actions can result in negative impacts. Provide avenues through which anonymous feedback can be provided. For example through a Qualtrics survey that does not include identifying information. Cornell community members can access a number of guides from the Intergroup Dialogue Project to help prepare them to engage in and/or facilitate challenging conversations. Utilize the R.A.V.E.N. Method for Responding to Microaggressions R edirect: (intervene) (correct) (pull aside) A sk probing questions for clarity I think I heard you say… what did you mean by that? I want to make sure I understand what you were saying, were you saying that…? V alues clarification You know, in this department we work hard to create a space that is safe and welcoming for all students What you just said is not in alignment or consistent with our institutional values that prioritize equity and inclusion E mphasize your own thoughts and feelings When I hear your comment, I think/feel… Many people might take that to mean… In my experience… N ext steps for addressing microaggressions Reflect and decide the next time you encounter this situation, what you might consider doing Drs. J. Luke Wood and Frank Harriss, CORA Learning: Responding Racial Bias and Microaggressions in Online Environments Webinar Diversity Recruitment & Equity-Based Holistic Review Consult with the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Access and Recruitment in the development of your strategic diversity outreach and recruitment plans, and engage in Consider Cornell: Explore. Experience. Belong. programming. Engage in intentional recruitment activities with diversity-focused societies, associations, and graduate pathways programs (for example, McNair Scholars, Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellows, CSTEP, LSAMP, etc.). When faculty and graduate students are invited to speak at other schools, ask if they may also have the opportunity to meet with undergraduate and/or graduate students who engaged in graduate school prep and/or future faculty programs. Focus on making this not just a recruitment activity, but a “Power Mentoring” opportunity where students have the opportunity to engage in candid discussions with faculty on professional and personal development topics of interest. Contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Access and Recruitment for training and recruitment materials for such sessions. Regularly evaluate your admission practices to ensure you are taking deliberate actions to mitigate bias, support equity, and fairly assess applicants within the context of their personal, professional, and academic circumstances (for example, evaluating them within the context of their current/previous institutions and what was available to them). For example, see Practical Guidance on Making and Keeping Graduate Admissions Equitable and Inclusive and Equitable Practices for Writing, Reading and Soliciting Letters of Recommendation for insights on how contextualization and equity-mindedness go hand in hand. See the Equity-Based Holistic Review Workshop & Resources for Graduate Admissions section of our Faculty Resources page. See also the AAAS & EducationCounsel Diversity and the Law Resources . Develop and utilize well-defined and mission-driven rubrics to evaluate applications. Regularly examine your application requirements – ensure you are clearly asking for what is most important to informing your selection process; and eliminate requirements for information not critical to informing selection. Utilize student prospect and degree conferral data by institution, and demographic groups to help inform the focus of diversity recruitment efforts. Cornell Graduate School Pipeline Report: Bachelor Degree Production by University, Program, Race, and Gender (Data from the National Center for Education Statistics) See also the Equity in Graduate Education Resources developed and provided by researchers with the Equity in Graduate Education Resource Center . Create a Sense of Belonging Use written and spoken language to communicate zero tolerance for racism, bias, harassment, and discrimination within all learning, research, and community environments. For example, see sample statements provided by the Center for Teaching Innovation. See also, Ten Steps for Building an Anti-Racist Lab , by Professors V. Bala Chaudhary, DePaul University, and Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, UC Merced. Provide access to resources providing strategies that address needs and concerns that might be more specific to more at-risk members of your community. For example, Safe Fieldwork Strategies for At-Risk Individuals , a fieldwork guide developed by Cornell Graduate Students, Amelia-Juliette Demery and Monique Pipkin, and Safer Science: Strategies to protect at-risk researchers when conducting fieldwork , a recorded webinar with inter-disciplinary experts in fieldwork and diversity and inclusion. See also the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ Inclusive Fieldwork page for additional information on the issues that can arise in the field, such as harassment, bullying, and discrimination, and strategies to adopt to ensure safe, accessible, and inclusive fieldwork experiences for all students. Use written and spoken language to signal the intentional inclusion of students who identify as Black, Latina/o/x, Indigenous, and/or with other identities historically excluded and underrepresented in academia. For example, explicating stating and striving to adhere to your field or department’s community values. See the Community Values Statement for Cornell’s Department of Astronomy as one example. Make an effort to establish connections with students who identify as Black, Latine, Indigenous and/or with other backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in academia such as first-generation college students (defined as neither parent having completed a bachelor’s degree). You can begin to do this by being welcoming, expressing interest in them as whole individuals, and recognizing their professional contributions to the field. Meaningful representation, not tokenism, matters. Consider how you are signaling aspects or inclusion (or exclusion) by who you invite as speakers, whose work is included in your syllabi, whose voices are missing and why, and whose work or accomplishments are recognized by awards or publications, etc. Discuss and Address Issues of Inequity & Justice in the Discipline Regardless of your discipline, find ways to address issues of racism, inequities, access, and justice within your local field or department at Cornell as well as in your discipline as a whole. (For example, see this talk on the problem with race-based medicine.) Examine your curriculum to identify whose voices and which communities have historically been excluded and why. Utilize the Intergroup Dialogue Project Curriculum Review Guide , which provides frameworks, questions, and tools to help academic units lead and engage in meaningful and productive conversations about inclusive curriculum review. Utilize the Center for Teaching Innovation consultation support for Curriculum Mapping , which offers a means of charting what happens at any given point throughout an academic program to confirm priorities and identify points of redundancy (such as duplicated instructional efforts), as well as address any potential gaps. This consultative service guides academic programs through the curriculum mapping process, with a specific focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes. Ask students for their input on whose voices are missing and whose work they would like to see included in your curriculum. As an act of justice, commit to including in your curriculum, seminars, etc. the voices of scholars who identify with historically excluded and underrepresented backgrounds. And don’t only do so in association with activities deemed as related only to diversity and inclusion. Ask speakers from historically underrepresented backgrounds if they would like to meet with any specific groups while on campus – including faculty leaders as well as graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Examine any problematic attitudes and behaviors of scholars and/or alumni who are upheld by your field or for whom awards, honors, etc. are named. For example, see Science’s “Amid protests against racism, scientists move to strip offensive names from journals, prizes, and more” and Nature’s “How Nature contributed to science’s discriminatory legacy: We want to acknowledge — and learn from — our history” . Examine whether established practices for qualifying (Q) and candidacy (A) exams are equitable and inclusive and whether expectations are transparently documented and communicated. Examine whether aspects of established practices associated with these exams threaten mental health, disproportionately lead to the attrition of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds in the field, and/or fail to substantively contribute to students’ development. For additional context and recommendations see Equity, well-being and learning all compel a re-examination of qualifying exams and the transition to Ph.D. candidacy Inclusive and Culturally Aware Advising & Mentoring Practices Identify and recognize your own culturally shaped beliefs, perceptions, and judgments. Develop both intrapersonal and interpersonal cultural awareness, and skills to recognize and respond to cultural diversity-related issues that may arise in your advising and mentoring relationships. Become aware of your own implicit biases and how to mitigate them. Regardless of a student’s background, do not make assumptions or generalizations about students based on any aspect of their social identities or lived experiences. Avoid making assumptions about the lived experiences and social identities of students by listening and learning from students about what they choose to share with you about their individual lived experiences and needs. Express interest in students as whole individuals, listening to what they choose to share about their experiences and asking about their specific interests, concerns, and goals. Use these insights to make informed suggestions on which opportunities and resources might best meet their academic and professional development interests and needs. As you learn more about your advisees and mentees as whole individuals, be cognizant of the cultural differences and similarities between yourself and them. For international students, keep in mind that their identities can frequently be racialized and marginalized in a U.S. context, which can be an unsettling experience. See this Open Campus blog post, How to Educate International Students About Race for contextual insights on speaking with international students about race within a U.S. context. Learn how to have meaningful conversations about identity and difference with graduate student advisees and mentees. For example, use the LARA method (Listen, Affirm, Respond, Add Information). LARA guides are available from the Cornell Intergroup Dialogue Project and Stanford SPARQtools . Become more familiar with the potential impact of social identity in challenging conversations, and learn how to engage productively across difference and conflicting perspectives. Help advisees and mentees identify resources within and beyond their graduate programs to support their development of a sense of belonging and community at Cornell within and beyond their graduate field. This is especially critical for students with identities that have historically been excluded from and underrepresented within the academy. Demystify the unwritten rules, language, expectations, and sociocultural norms of graduate education (especially within the context of your specific graduate field and discipline) through your field handbook, website, lab manuals, professional development seminars, and other means. Example lab manuals: Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research Paula Hammond Lab at MIT Mike Boots at UC Berkeley Lesley Chow Lab at Lehigh Example faculty/student mutual expectations/mentoring agreements documents: Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) Mutual Expectations Agreement Plan University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research – Mentoring Compact Examples University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School – Sample Mentoring Agreement Make formal and informal professionalization and socialization activities more accessible to all advisees and mentees. Example Resources: Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) website. Cornell community members can access recordings of talks on Culturally Attuned Mentoring Paradigms by Dr. Sweeney Windchief, Montana State University, Equity-Minded Mentorship – Why and How Identity Matters by Dr. Kimberly Griffin, University of Maryland, and on the book Equity in Science: Representation, Culture, and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education by Dr. Julie Posselt, University of Southern California. Cornell community members can access a free copy of the e-book version of “Equity in Science” through the Cornell Library and a book discussion guide through the Equity in Graduate Education Resource Center website. Ongoing Learning Opportunities Create avenues for ongoing formal and informal learning opportunities for graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff around issues of diversity, equity, access, justice, and inclusion. Consider what levers you can use to influence faculty to engage in such opportunities. For example, embed such learning opportunities in activities in which all or most faculty participate such as faculty meetings, faculty retreats, department seminars. Incentivize and encourage faculty to engage in learning opportunities supportive of their ongoing development as mentors. The Graduate School provides workshops, individual faculty consultations, and hosts invited speakers and facilitated panel discussions that focus on advancing inclusive mentoring practices and cultures within graduate education and academia. For more information on inclusive mentoring resources visit the FAIM Resource Center website or contact Associate Deans Sara Xayarath Hernández at grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu and Colleen McLinn at cmm252@cornell.edu . National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity: Re-Thinking Mentoring – How to build communities of inclusion, support, and accountability CIMER (Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research): Entering Mentoring Curricula The University of Minnesota’s Optimizing the Practice of Mentoring asynchronous online self-paced research mentor training. SABER Striving Towards Inclusive Academic Biology Virtual Seminar Series (relevant content for those across the disciplines) National Academics – The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEM National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) Resources for Faculty Mentors Duke University – Graduate School Mentor Toolkit Embed learning opportunities for graduate students into field structures such as orientation, first-year seminars, TA training, mentor training, etc. Signal to graduate students that their engagement in activities such as Consider Cornell , diversity and inclusion-focused graduate student organizations , and other related activities are important to the field. (Appreciate that engagement in such activities are often vital to the well-being and sense of belonging for students that identify with backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in academia.) Utilize the Any Person, Many Stories: Histories of Exclusion and Inclusion at Cornell project as a resource. This project features stories in sketch, biography, podcast, interview, and video formats that can be used as learning resources for courses, workshops, and other meaningful purposes. The stories featured delve into powerful, sometimes painful histories, many of which are not broadly known. These stories also help to bring recognition to many of those who fought for a more inclusive Cornell and how their efforts are ever more critical to informing our ongoing and future DEI efforts at Cornell and beyond. Institutionalize Structures & Action Plans Develop a committee, council, or work-group focused on advancing diversity, equity, access, justice, and inclusion in your field and/or most closely aligned department(s). Create a webpage or website where information about this group is publicly accessible. Set up the group so they have actual power and influence on policies, structures, and other activities of value and importance to the field or department. Develop a clear structure and term of commitment for service. Seek to mitigate power differentials between group members (esp. between faculty and students) and help ensure there is equity in whose ideas are heard & acted upon. Do not expect students from historically underrepresented backgrounds to lead or participate in the group. However, provide the opportunity for them to do so if they choose and ensure there are mechanisms for them and other members of your community to provide feedback. (For example, through focus group discussions and/or community dialogues.) Develop a public website where you communicate your community values as well as short and long-term action plans to advance diversity, access, equity, and inclusion. Use tools such as the following to help inform the assessment of your field (or department) on various aspects of diversity and inclusion: Graduate School Intranet – for access to field-level data from sources such as the Doctoral Experience Survey. AAS Diversity Taskforce Report (Appendix X for Departmental Self-Assessment Rubric) . UC Berkeley – Academic Unit Strategic Planning for Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity toolkit . Publicly document areas of progress as well as opportunities for improvement. (Transparency is an asset for many reasons, including in the recruitment of prospective students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.) Publicly acknowledge and highlight the contributions of graduate students and other members of your community toward the advancement of diversity, equity, access, justice, and inclusion. (Not just current contributions, but past contributions. Student advocacy and leadership have been essential to many areas of historical progress.) Make sure that work in this arena is not just the responsibility of this group, but rather ensure that aspects of this work are considered critical to other field or department committees (curriculum, academic policies, facilities/space, search committees, admissions committees, etc.). Consider creating opportunities for students to participate in faculty search committees. Recognize the additional emotional labor associated with this work and provide students with acknowledgment and support for example, via professional development or travel funds. Examine the recommendations being shared by various community stakeholders via formal and informal means and consider how any could inform short and long-term strategic action plans. Consider also how recommendations might inform how current actions need to be communicated more broadly and clearly.

Community Outreach Award Jayme Kilburn The recipient of the 2019 Community Outreach Award is Jaym e Kilburn , Ph.D. candidate in the field of performing and media arts. Jayme is being recognized for her extensive engagement with numerous communities through multiple outreach programs. Jayme is an instructor with the Cornell Prison Education Program where she teaches and directs the Phoenix Players, a group of inmates that creates original theatre productions based on stories from the men’s personal lives with the goal of fostering agency, dignity, and changes in the prison industrial complex. Jayme has also hosted a series of workshops for women-identified participants to talk about their personal lives and socially relevant themes, then transforms these stories into a series of community-based theatre productions titled “She Persists” that have been performed in Ithaca and Baltimore. Finally, Jayme has intentionally confronted the lack of gender and racial parity in theatre by creating a two-day symposium, “Feminist Directions: Performance, Power, and Leadership”, where artists and activists from across the country came together to address misogyny in the performing arts. Jayme not only created this initiative, she also obtained all the funding needed to hold the event as well as to ensure that all performers would be paid by pursuing multiple grants and sponsorships. Jayme also mentored undergraduate women that worked as assistant managers and employed women-owned catering companies to provide the meals. Jayme’s nominator states, “Jayme is committed to breaking cycles of violence, harnessing the utopian power of theater to dramatize alternative worlds, and providing a platform for underrepresented people to share their stories in their own words.” It is our honor to recognize Jayme with the Community Outreach Award for these efforts to empower marginalized communities at Cornell and beyond. Unsung Hero Award Belinda Floyd, Graduate Field Assistant for the Field of Biomedical Engineering Belinda is being recognized for her extraordinary efforts supporting graduate and professional degree students in the biomedical engineering graduate field in their sense of belonging, overall well-being, progression, and achievement. Belinda’s nominators state that while her official title is graduate field assistant, her unofficial and better-fitting title is “mother of all BME graduate students”. In her role she provides support and guidance to almost 200 Ph.D. and master’s of engineering students from a wide variety of diverse backgrounds, helping them to transition into graduate school, overcome obstacles they may face in their professional or personal lives while here, and even checking in with students after they’ve left Cornell to make sure that they are still doing well. Her personal relationships with students have allowed her to follow up with her supervisors if she notices students in distress so that they can collectively provide those students with any help that they might need. In some cases, this has made the difference between a student finishing their degree and leaving the program early. Her nominators say that “The biomedical engineering community is a better place because of Belinda, and she has been instrumental in promoting the well-being and inclusion of the diverse BME community.” It is our pleasure to recognize Belinda for her contributions to the field of biomedical engineering by presenting her with an Unsung Hero Award. The 2019 Unsung Hero Awardees (from left to right) Belinda Floyd, Eric Maroney, and Tara Reed Eric Maroney , Graduate Field Assistant for the Field of Policy Analysis and Management Eric is being recognized for his contributions to the well-being of students in the field of policy analysis and management where he consistently exceeds what is expected in his role as graduate field assistant. Some examples of times where Eric has gone above and beyond include the creation of a guide to the policy analysis and management graduate program that informs students of necessary deadlines and forms within days of it being requested by students in the program, the implementation of a survey of graduate students’ needs, followed by taking steps to address those needs with the field’s DGS, and assisting students with job searches by setting up a placement website and helping to organize application materials such as letters of recommendation. And as his nominator emphasizes, “He does all of this with such competence and in such a serene manner that he is a calming influence for all of the students.” In recognition of all that he does to support the graduate students in policy analysis and management we are glad to present him with an Unsung Hero Award. Tara Reed , Conference Coordinator for the School of Integrative Plant Sciences Tara is being recognized for going above and beyond in supporting the Diversity Preview Weekend, a program that promotes diversity and inclusion in several life sciences graduate programs by bringing undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to Cornell to learn about graduate education at Cornell, network with students, faculty, and staff, and gain a better understanding of the graduate school admissions process. As SIPS conference coordinator Tara lent her expertise in organizing large events to the DPW throughout the planning process and the event itself. She arranged travel and lodging for over 40 visiting students, reserved numerous rooms, assisted with the catering for more than a dozen meals, receptions, and snack breaks, and attended every event during the weekend, including on Saturday and Sunday, to provide support and address any problems that came up. One graduate student leader on the DPW organizing committee appreciated how Tara’s support gave them the time to be engaged with the visiting students instead of having to worry about logistics, saying, “Tara provided the energy, making sure nothing was missing, and giving us the opportunity to be fully engaged and focused on our participants.” A final quote from Tara’s nominations says it all: “The expansion of DPW would not be possible without Tara’s support and positive attitude”. We are happy to be able to recognize Tara’s contributions to the DPW and SIPS with an Unsung Hero Award. Faculty Champion Awards for Junior & Senior Faculty Junior Faculty Jamila Michener The recipient of the 2019 Junior Faculty Champion Award is Assistant Professor of Government Jamila Michener . We recognize Professor Michener for being a dedicated and tireless advocate for diversity, inclusion, and equity in her scholarship, in her exemplary pedagogy, mentorship, and advising of undergraduate and graduate students, in her campus leadership activities as a co-organizer of two new minors, as an Engaged Faculty Fellow, a contributor to Cornell’s Inequality Studies and Prison Education programs, a member of university-wide diversity and inclusion committees, and also in her outreach activities in surrounding communities. Professor Michener has made significant contributions toward promoting the growth and personal, professional, and intellectual development of graduate students in political science across social, political, ethnic, racial, class, and gender diversities, and making students feel more included in the academy. Her students had the following to say about her. For one student, who “felt a lot of pressure to write a dissertation that ‘looked like’ mainstream political science,” conversations with Jamila were some of the most helpful in terms of developing the confidence to pursue a topic that was a bit outside of the ordinary. Another credits her for “helping to develop the confidence to follow their instincts.” Another student said, “She helps me to envision my trajectory as a scholar because she demonstrates a constant example of what I hope to achieve as a researcher, educator, and person.” It is our pleasure to recognize Professor Michener for these efforts to promote equity and inclusivity and support graduate student development with the 2019 Junior Faculty Champion Award. Senior Faculty The recipients of the 2019 Senior Faculty Champion Awards are Susan Daniel, associate professor in the Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Hadas Kress-Gazit, associate professor in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Susan Daniel Professor Susan Daniel’s work as an advocate for students from underrepresented groups and to foster a more diverse and inclusive department started when she arrived at Cornell as an assistant professor. During that time, she worked to create the Graduate Women’s Group in Chemical and biomolecular engineering (CBE WOMEN), which provides a space to celebrate the success of women in the department as well as provide access to outreach and career development opportunities. One such opportunity is the Women’s Outreach in Materials, Energy, and Nanobiotechnology event, which brings in high school students from the upstate region, to offer hands-on experience to research and education about STEM fields and college. This event has shown great success, with a large portion of participants going on to a college education and inciting strong leadership within the graduate students that help to organize the event. Professor Daniel is also the founding faculty mentor of the Science Blender podcast that works to combine the identity and personal experiences of diverse scientists with their professional work to provide role models for underrepresented students. During her time as the director of graduate studies for CBE, Professor Daniel worked to increase recruitment of diverse students to the department, with this past year yielding the most diverse incoming class yet. Most recently, she led the creation of her department’s Diversity and Inclusion Program (DIP). The DIP has worked to create initiatives that identify the challenges the department faces in terms of climate and inclusion and ways to address them. Professor Daniel has dedicated herself to each and every one of these endeavors to not only create a more diverse and inclusive environment in her department, but also to foster strong engagement and leadership from graduate students, and for that we would like to recognize her as a Senior Faculty Champion. Hadas Kress-Gazit Throughout her time at Cornell, Professor Hadas Kress-Gazit has been committed to fostering diversity, inclusion, and equity and has had an impact on a number of different communities. Twice, she has led the research project for the CURIE academy, a one-week residential summer program for high school women focused on helping them explore engineering through experiential learning and multiple tiers of mentoring from engineering faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. Nearly all of the rising high school seniors that participated in the CURIE Academy research projects led by Professor Kress-Gazit applied to Cornell engineering, with almost half enrolling. Professor Kress-Gazit was also the Keynote Speaker for the 2016 Expanding Your Horizons conference, a one-day event for 7th-9th grade girls intended to stimulate interest in STEM fields through hands-on workshops. She has worked to bring in speakers with a focus on engineering and scientific culture to gain insight into making communities for inclusive. Professor Kress-Gazit has also influenced the robotics community as a whole by starting initiatives that provide travel grants for students from underrepresented groups to attend the Robotics: Science and Systems conference and to provide networking opportunities for late career graduate students and postdocs. This past spring, Professor Kress-Gazit led a faculty search committee for the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and in doing so made several changes to the search process in order to increase diversity, such as adding an engagement statement from all applicants. Her passion and commitment to increasing diversity and inclusion throughout not only the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell, but also in the field of robotics more broadly, is extraordinary, and because of that, we would like to recognize her as a Senior Faculty Champion.

Outside of academics she’s an outdoor adventurer, quasi-musician, part-time performer, and amateur influencer. The Cornell Institute of Archeology and Material Studies – Anti-Racism Anti-Colonialism Interest Group The Anti-racism and Anti-colonialism (ARCO) Interest Group is an organization geared toward uprooting systemic racism in archaeological practice and pedagogy by facilitating productive discussions and providing anti-racist programming for the CIAMS community, inspired by the calls to #ShutDownAcademia and #ShutDownStem on June 10th, 2020 in an effort to support the Black Lives Matter Movement. This past year they have striven to continue the dialogue through several modes, including the facilitation of follow-up discussions between students and faculty about a seminar series hosted by the Society of Black Archaeologists (SBA), Indigenous Archaeology Collective (IAC), Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, SAPIENS, and Cornell Institute of Archaeology and Material Studies (CIAMS) seminar series. They have organized two separate reading groups: one for all members of the CIAMS community and one for graduate students and postdoctoral associates that focus on texts that consider the historical and current role of colonialism in archaeology. In doing so, they have been able to discuss issues of importance for the CIAMS community and to create a safe space for the graduate student community to voice their thoughts and concerns. All discussions are oriented toward the overarching goal to be responsibly practicing scholars in the future. Their long-term projects include the curation of an anti-colonial and anti-racist reading list with a focus on publications in archaeology, the development of a fieldwork and laboratory code of conduct, and the improvement of their capacity for shaping pedagogy and field projects that are informed by the varying perspectives. In the coming year, they plan to develop a mentoring program between graduate and undergraduate students. ARCO is a continuing group effort only possible through the participation and support of CIAMS students, postdoctoral associates, faculty, and affiliates. Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (IDEEAS) Working Group Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , or IDEEAS, formed organically in October 2019 as a grassroots collective within earth and atmospheric sciences (EAS). IDEEAS’ mission is to foster inclusion, belonging, and community in EAS among students, administrative staff, research staff, faculty, professors emeriti, and alumni. We actively promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and access as core values. We promote these values by bringing equity, diversity, and inclusion learning opportunities to the EAS community and create frameworks to ensure equitable access to department educational, research, and professional opportunities. IDEEAS provides a space to have important conversations and then take appropriate, collective action within the context of our department. IDEEAS is a non-hierarchical group within the hierarchical setting of academia. Self-selected from the full cross-section of the EAS department, IDEEAS comprises students, staff, researchers, pre-tenure and tenured faculty, emeriti, and alumni. We formed IDEEAS to educate ourselves on inclusive practices and create a more visible, equity-focused culture in the department, with the experiences and perspectives of our personal and professional communities in mind. The IDEEAS ethos rests on the premise that leadership is a dynamic process a group can enact collectively, rather than an intrinsic quality that an appointed individual exercises over followers. This principle informs how we communicate internally as a department and how we define our priorities as a community. IDEEAS organizes events with dual goals of fostering social connection and community within the department and providing intentional learning opportunities to promote critical reflection and discussion. Past and ongoing events include a well-attended kickoff party with a facilitated conversation, a regular Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Journal Discussion, community conversations about implicit bias and structural racism, and social events to foster connection, particularly during the pandemic. Community Outreach Award The recipients of the 2021 Community Outreach Award are Claire Fox, Kimberly Fuqua, and Robert Swanda. Claire Fox Claire Fox , Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology, is recognized for her contributions to community outreach. During her time at Cornell she worked alongside fellow educators and community members to co-found and co-direct two impactful nonprofit organizations in Ithaca dedicated to expanding access to science. With the Physics Bus, Claire helped to bring the joys of physics to people of all ages and all walks of life. Unique physics exhibits made from junk delight everyone from senior living communities and music festivals to Title 1 schools and neighborhood block parties. With Free Science Workshop, she helped to establish a no-cost drop-in program for underserved and underrepresented youth. At Free Science Workshop participants can explore whatever aspect of science and invention interest them the most. It is an empowering environment designed to promote confidence, connectedness, and a lifelong love of learning. Claire did whatever needed doing for these dynamic programs: driving the bus, staffing drop-in hours, developing and leading activities, writing grants and reports, chairing meetings, mentoring kids, evaluating the program, developing community partnerships, and recruiting other grad students to get involved too! This past year Claire joined the board of the Global Alliance for Community Science Workshops. She is now taking what she learned from community outreach in Ithaca and applying it to program creation in Pittsburgh. Claire encourages scientists in all phases of their career to give back to their communities and promote equitable access to science enrichment for youth.

Robert Swanda Robert Swanda is a Ph.D. candidate in the biomedical and biological sciences program at Cornell University. His research investigates understanding the movement between mRNA and protein production (a process called translation) and how mRNA can be leveraged as a therapeutic for diseases. Specifically, Rob has worked to create mRNAs that are rich in sulfur amino acids and has targeted these mRNAs to cancer cells to mitigate their growth. During his time at Cornell, Rob has been awarded an NIH Chemical Biology Interface (CBI) predoctoral fellowship and an American Heart Association predoctoral fellowship. As part of the CBI training program, Rob organized and ran the NIH CBI meeting at Cornell by identifying and selecting speakers to give research talks, seeking out professional development workshops, and hosting literature lunches for students. However, Rob’s commitments extend beyond the laboratory and enter the community. Throughout his graduate career Rob has volunteered with Cornell’s Center for Material Research, Cornell SACNAS, and has acted as a Graduate School Ambassador. He also engages in service-learning projects through the SMART program that partners individuals from Cornell in tackling issues in emerging markets. Rob has participated and led these projects in Colombia (January 2018), Kenya (January 2019), and Rwanda (January 2020). During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation on the COVID-19 vaccines was all over the internet. Backed with his research on mRNA, Rob sought to make short vaccine tutorials, breaking down the science for lay and professionals alike. His videos went viral, educating over 6 million people across the world and counting. Rob partnered with others in various countries to have the information translated into multiple languages to further break down the barriers of this scientific content.

within the Academy MAC Public Keynote on Mentoring within the Academy Every year, the MAC Mentoring Program, in collaboration with OISE and other campus partners, hosts the MAC Public Keynote on Mentoring within the Academy. This keynote initiative provides our broader Cornell community the opportunity to learn from scholar-practitioners nationally recognized for their work on improving mentoring practices and academic culture, climate, and sense of belonging within graduate education and the professoriate. 2024 MAC Public Keynote: Equity-Minded Mentorship – Why and How Identity Matters February 29, 2024 Access the recording of this talk. Speaker: Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of the College of Education and Professor of Higher Education, University of Maryland Session Summary While we know mentoring relationships are powerful interventions and a key strategy for promoting equity in the academy, we also know that these relationships often fall short of fulfilling their potential, particularly for early career colleagues with marginalized and minoritized identities. We will talk about what gets in our way of leveraging the power of mentorship to close equity gaps in the academy, and I will offer a framework for thinking about identity in the context of our relationships. We will also talk about promising practices and strategies that can enhance our ability to form mentoring relationships grounded in equity, affirmation, and care. About Our Speaker Dr. Kimberly Griffin is Dean of the College of Education and a Professor in the Higher Education, Student Affairs, and International Education Policy Program (Student Affairs Area of Specialization). Dr. Griffin earned her doctoral degree in Higher Education and Organizational Change from UCLA, her Master’s degree in Education Policy and Leadership at the University of Maryland, and her Bachelor’s degree from Stanford University in Psychology. Prior to completing her doctoral work, Dr. Griffin worked in higher education administration, primarily focusing in the areas of diversity recruitment, admissions, and retention in undergraduate and graduate education. Dr. Griffin’s research interests are primarily focused in three areas: diversity and equity in graduate education and the professoriate; diversity within the Black higher education community; and mentoring and career development. These interests have led her to conduct work on a variety of topics, including: career development of Ph.D. completers in science, Black professors and their engagement in student interaction, the experiences of Black immigrant college students, diversity recruitment in graduate education, and campus racial climate. Dr. Griffin is skilled in advanced quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as the integration of these strategies in mixed methods research. Dr. Griffin is an active scholar and researcher, engaged widely in efforts to promote diversity and equity in higher education. Her research has been funded by the Burroughs Welcome Fund, National Institutes of Health, and National Science Foundation. Her work has been published widely, and has appeared in the Review of Higher Education, Journal of College Student Development, Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, and Journal of Negro Education. Dr. Griffin’s work also contributes to national conversations on equity and inclusion, and she has collaborated and consulted with the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, National Academies, American Council on Education, and the Council of Graduate Schools to discuss extant research and new initiatives. She served as editor of the Journal of Diversity in Higher Education from 2018-2022. Sponsorship MAC Peer Mentoring Program, Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement, and the Future Faculty and Academic Careers Program 2023 MAC Public Keynote: Solutions for Changing the Academy from the Undergraduate to the Professoriate February 17, 2023 Members of the Cornell community may access a recording of this talk on the OISE Cornell Video on Demand channel. Speaker: Dr. Corey Welch (Northern Cheyenne), Director, STEM Scholars Program, Iowa State University Session Summary Despite decades of interventions, diversity within the STEM academia/workforce has seen only incremental progress & a continued unwillingness to change how we select, train, & hire historically excluded/underrepresented individuals from the undergraduate through the professoriate. I’ll summarize some of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion research and the on-going challenge to apply what is widely known within STEM Education research. I’ll talk about an innovative UG STEM/Biology program that differs from traditional diversity interventions. I will interject some on-going solutions being led by Indigenous scholars and share my own experiences as a Northern Cheyenne Biologist and Administrator. About Our Speaker Dr. Corey Welch is the Director of the STEM Scholars Program at Iowa State University. His love of nature took a first-generation, low-income, Northern Cheyenne/White kid from a trailer park in Montana toward a career as a biologist. He has a biology degree from Lewis & Clark College, a M.S. in the department of Systematics & Ecology from the University of Kansas, and a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Washington. He has done extensive fieldwork in Kansas, the Pacific Northwest, and Eastern Australia. Prior to his Ph.D., he taught introductory biology & ecology at Haskell Indian Nations University, one of the largest tribal colleges. After his postdoc, he transitioned to full-time student development as a program coordinator of the Biology Scholars Program at UC Berkeley, an innovative nationally recognized program for minorities and low-income students. In 2016, he established the STEM Scholars, modeled after this program. The mission of the STEM Scholars is to diversify who succeeds in the sciences with a current 208 membership that is comprised of 62% Minoritized, 60% low-income, 71% first-generation, and 71% female. Corey uses the latest STEM Education research and his own experience as a first-generation, low-income, Northern Cheyenne Tribal member to train the next generation of scientists. In 2022 he was awarded the SACNAS Presidential Service Award for his years of continued contributions to SACNAS and are selected by the SACNAS Board President. Corey frequently gives talks around the country on diversifying the Sciences from the undergraduate to the professoriate, serves on NIH/NSF/HHMI Grant Review Panels, and occasionally publishes papers on ways to improve the biology education and faculty hiring, retention, promotion, and tenure practices. He spoke in Washington DC. at the March For Science, and from 2016-2021, he served on the National Board of Directors of SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicano/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science) and remains active on several committees.

Implicit in this description are the ideas that at the core of mentoring is a process of teaching – to guide, instruct and that mentoring may largely be a one-way flow of information. Increasingly, however, mentoring is being understood as a process best facilitated through a bilateral exchange and flow of knowledge and learning between individuals in a mentoring exchange. In this evolving conceptualization and practice of mentoring, both mentor and mentee are positioned as learners and teachers. In this presentation, I explore effective means of cultivating mentoring as a place of collaborative learning and reciprocal cultivation, that promotes the growth and success of all involved in the mentoring process. About Our Speaker Beronda L. Montgomery, Ph.D. is the Michigan State University Foundation Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory. She is a writer, researcher, and scholar who pursues a common theme of understanding how individuals perceive, respond to, and are impacted by the environments in which they exist. Her primary laboratory-based research is focused on the responses of photosynthetic organisms (i.e., plants and cyanobacteria) to external light cues. Additionally, Beronda pursues this theme in the context of effective mentoring and leadership of individuals, and the role of innovative leaders in supporting success. Her 2021 book, Lessons From Plants , enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?

Building Allyship Initiative is a collaboration of the Graduate and Professional Student Diversity Council and the Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement (OISE). Through panel discussion and public talks, the Building Allyship Initiative provides an opportunity for members of the Cornell community to gain insights into the depth and breadth of identities and experiences represented within our graduate community and engage in productive dialogue focused on fostering a greater understanding of the many aspects of critical allyship and its practice. Each event seeks to create a safe space for critical dialogue where we can bridge gaps in knowledge, learn from each other, and create understanding without fear of judgment. Read this article, Impact vs. Intent: Becoming Critical Allies Through Workshop Series , to learn more about this initiative. 2023 Building Allyship Keynote Supporting Trans and Nonbinary People During Turbulent Times Speaker: Dr. Leo Taylor, Entomology Ph.D. ’15 ​​​​​​​ Date: October 4, 2023 Access the recording Access a collection of the keynote slides Session Summary The current sociopolitical climate in the U.S. is having devastating impacts on trans and nonbinary people, and those who love them. So far in 2023, 567 bills have been introduced across 49 states, 83 of which have passed, for the purposes of denying trans people access to basic healthcare, education, legal recognition, and the right to simply exist in the public eye. What can aspiring non-trans allies do to uplift and protect trans and nonbinary people under such extraordinary circumstances? How can trans people engage in empowered self-allyship without becoming fatigued, or worse, desensitized to the ongoing trauma? Dr. Leo Taylor, speaker, DEI consultant, transsexual, person with a disability, aspiring ally to all minoritized groups, and entomologist will be returning to his alma mater to discuss strategies for becoming an effective ally to trans and nonbinary people at Cornell and beyond. With compelling boldness and a good dose of humor Leo will describe his experiences as a transman from a small town in Indiana who began his transition nearly a quarter of a century ago, during the early days of the internet. He’ll walk us through some of the highlights and darkest moments he experienced as a transsexual during the late 2000’s and early 2010’s from the perspectives of both an Ithaca resident and Cornell graduate student and describe major changes that have occurred at the University since. Most importantly, aspiring allies will receive tangible strategies they can use to bolster and preserve trans and nonbinary people in their lives, communities, and across the country. About Our Speaker Dr. Leo Taylor Dr. Leo Taylor (Entomology Ph.D. ’15) is a seasoned DEI educator, speaker, and consultant with a focus on transgender and nonbinary identities and LGBTQ+ culture. With over 15 years of experience, he offers customized workshops and consulting services to help organizations and individuals navigate diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. Leo’s background includes a B.S. in psychology and M.S. in biology, both from Ball State University, and a Ph.D. in entomology from Cornell University. His extensive expertise in DEI topics stems from hundreds of workshops, webinars, presentations, and keynote addresses. Leo’s unique perspective as a queer transman, who began his transition in 1999, provides rare insights into the experiences and challenges of a still very misunderstood population. As a DEI consultant who also works at The Ohio State University, Leo approaches his work with grace, humility, transparency, vulnerability, and a big dose of humor. He shares his extraordinary life experiences, having been perceived as a straight woman, lesbian, straight man, and gay man, all before the age of 40! Leo emphasizes the transformative power of trans visibility and the vital role non-trans allies play in advancing inclusion and equity.

Claire aims to center the voices of people with marginalized identities to better understand what effective allyship looks like at work. 2021-22 Building Allyship Sessions October 2021: Understanding and Combating Insidious Forms of Anti-Asian Racism This session included an invited talk and moderated panel discussion focused on developing an understanding of anti-Asian racism and the many insidious forms in which it can manifest. It also centered on sharing strategies on how those seeking to serve as allies can actively help combat anti-Asian racism including overt and covert forms of violence. This session was hosted in collaboration with the Society for Asian American Graduate Affairs (SAAGA), a graduate student organization dedicated to advocating for graduate students who identify as members and/or are allies of the Asian and/or Asian American community. SAAGA works to create a network of support to better address academic, career, and social justice issues related to the Asian and Asian American graduate student population. SAAGA strives to create a safe space for its members to socialize with others, share academic and professional advice, and discuss issues of race, ethnicity, politics, and culture as they pertain to Asians/Asian Americans. Activities include invited lectures, discussions, film screenings, collaborations with other similar groups on campus, networking events, and more.

Pham , Ph.D. Candidate, Comparative Literature November 2021: The Marginalization and Racialization of International Scholar Identities within the U.S. Context This session included an invited talk and moderated panel discussion focused on developing an understanding of how international scholar identities can be racialized and marginalized within the U.S. context and how this can impact their experiences within the academy. The panelists shared what contributes to or hinders their sense of belonging and the strategies aspiring allies can employ to support international scholars who may be experiencing xenophobia alongside new aspects of marginalization. This discussion also explored what individual and collective actions we can take to validate the experiences of international scholars and create more inclusive learning, research, and social environments. This session was hosted in collaboration with Graduate and Professional Students International (GSPI), an organization dedicated to building a community for international graduate and professional students through social events, networking opportunities, an online information hub, and mentoring. GSPI seeks to demystify many of the unwritten rules and norms of graduate school and to be a source of support to international scholars as they transition into and progress through their graduate studies at Cornell. The organization is especially concerned about helping to support international scholars who may be studying in the United States for the first time.

We explored the myths around neurodiversity within the context of academia and research environments. Additionally, we discussed ways to help mitigate the stigmatization of those in our communities whom we disable by misunderstanding neurodivergence. Panelists discussed barriers that neurodivergent people face, and accommodations or structural changes that dissolve these barriers. They also discussed how aspiring allies can best and continuously support all members of our neurodiverse community regardless of bodymind. Recognition of neurodiversity brings value to Cornell University, and through critical allyship, we can all help our community thrive by embracing neurodiversity in all of its forms.

During this session, we will dive into the performative aspects of land acknowledgements and how land-grant universities such as Cornell have a responsibility to move beyond these statements for Indigenous communities. Shifting the focus from acknowledgment to action, speakers will discuss ways students, non-Indigenous communities, and institutions can localize allyship. Such actions range from citing Indigenous thinkers, to supporting local Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫʼ sovereignty and centering Indigenous relationships with the Land. We hope to amplify the voices of Indigenous students at Cornell, the members of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫʼ , and the larger Haudenosaunee confederacy, as well as suggest actions to support Indigenous communities. * The capitalization of land vs Land is intentional in both the title and description. This is following Dr. Sandra Styres and Dr. Dawn Zinga’s syntactical practice in their writing “The community-first Land- centred theoretical framework: bringing a ‘good mind’ to Indigenous education research?” as well as Dr. Max Liboiron’s “Pollution is Colonialism.” The capitalization of Land acknowledges “the unique entity that is the combined living spirit of plants, animals, air, water, humans, histories, and events recognized by many Indigenous communities.” Whereas when land is not capitalized, we refer “to the concept from a colonial worldview whereby landscapes are common, universal, and everywhere” ( Liboiron 2021). This Building Allyship Series session is collaboratively hosted by the Graduate and Professional Student Diversity Council , Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement , and the Indigenous Graduate Student Association .

Application & Program Schedule Access the Application Application Due Date: May 15, 2024 (note extended deadline) Selection Decisions released by mid-May, 2024 Virtual Program Dates and Times: June 11-13, 2024, 1:00 – 5:00 p.m. ET *For Cornell students based in Ithaca, there is an additional in-person meeting on Friday, June 14, 11:00 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. ET Should You Apply? You have a choice of leadership development opportunities within and beyond Cornell via multiple offerings of courses and programs. We would like you to choose the best of these options for yourself. If you are considering applying to the Colman Inclusive Leadership Program, you should know that it is an immersive learning experience. It is predicated on discovery, integration, and synthesis and not on prescriptive norms of leadership. We quote from former participants below to help you decide. It is for you if you are seeking what these participants have described: “Because of this program, I am more keenly aware of areas where I can be more prone to making leadership missteps. Because of this, I can now actively work on improving areas where I am far from where I want to be, and continue to put myself in situations that leverage my strengths as a leader. I especially enjoyed the visioning section and the lesson about putting up boundaries was something that I certainly needed to hear.” “The program helped me to be more aware about myself and others. In addition, it helped me identify the areas of Emotional Intelligence in which I am strong and the ones in which I need to work more. It was also great to understand the ways on how I deal with conflict the best and the ones I need to work on more to be a better and more inclusive leader.” The Colman Inclusive Leadership Program is for you if you are prepared to engage in intensive self-discovery with similarly committed peers from diverse identities, interests, and experiences. This program does not focus on the development and practice of specific managerial skills.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Diversity & Inclusion Signature Initiatives My Voice, My Story My Voice, My Story Understanding the Untold Lived Experiences of Graduate & Professional Students My Voice, My Story pairs video monologues – constructed from the experiences of real graduate students – with facilitated discussions. The primary objective of My Voice, My Story is to utilize the power of narrative to achieve a greater understanding of the depth and breadth of the lived experiences of graduate and professional students. Through stories and discussion, participants explore the many types of experiences within graduate education that frequently go untold, and learn and share strategies on how to create more inclusive and supportive research and mentoring environments. Learning Objectives Listening to and discussing the stories of the characters portrayed in the My Voice, My Story monologues provides participants with opportunities for learning through: Listening for understanding, especially when we think we are different from one another. Understanding intent versus impact and the possible implications when the two don’t align. Developing awareness and understanding of experiences of exclusion and inclusion in research and mentoring environments. Establishing respect for our mutual similarities and differences. Experiencing empathy for and identification with all of the characters portrayed in the video monologues. Recognizing instances of implicit bias. Learning and sharing strategies on how one can contribute to improving the climate of research and mentoring environments. How long is a My Voice, My Story Session? 120 minutes: 20 minutes for introductions, opening, and content delivery; 20 minutes for videos; 70 minutes for facilitated dialogue; 10 minutes for closing Focus Audiences Graduate and professional students Faculty Staff who work with graduate and professional students Strategies for Successful My Voice, My Story (MVMS) Sessions Limit the audience size to no more than ~35 participants, and no less than 12 participants. Work in advance with the MVMS facilitation team to schedule and plan the delivery of a MVMS session. Utilize a room with a set up that will help support easy engagement in large and small group discussions; avoid rooms with fixed sitting such as auditoriums. Consider how MVMS sessions could become part of the regular cycle of professional development programming for specific audiences within your graduate field, department, or college. Explore with the facilitation team how individual monologues from MVMS can be used in place of case studies for other programs such as mentor training. Share this article on how MVMS is using the power of personal narratives to advance inclusion and belonging.

Dr. Desir is a native New Yorker, and in his spare time enjoys running, Muay-Thai kickboxing, and attending concerts. 12-12:30 p.m. ET Boxed Lunch 12:30-2 p.m. ET Alumni Keynote Session – Mentorship: Why it is Important Now and How it Sets the Course for a Successful Future Speaker: Coalton Bennett, Ph.D. ’10, Patent Agent, McCarter & Fish Session Summary The graduate school experience should be a period in your life in which you have the opportunity to explore and develop different ideas, learn about different areas of research that you think might develop into your dissertation, and hopefully learn even more about areas that you are unfamiliar with or that you think you might not be so interested in. During your tenure as a graduate student, you should try to explore different research topics and develop those interests into well-defined projects that ultimately culminate into a dissertation that is uniquely your own and helps advance the corresponding field(s) of research. While graduate school should afford you this opportunity, sometimes it’s not as straightforward and ideal as one might envision it to be. During this session, Dr. Bennett will share thoughts on how best to navigate the process of identifying what it is that you want to work on and why mentorship is so important in helping you achieve what you set out to accomplish as a graduate student. About Dr. Coalton Bennett D r. Coalton Bennett is a patent agent, assisting in the preparation and prosecution of patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Dr. Bennett has a significant technical background in a wide range of areas including computer networks, internet applications and software, audio signal processing, speech processing, image processing, wireless communications standards including IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4, cellular data service (knowledge of various standards including GSM, CDMA, GPRS, 3G, UMTS, etc.), mobile advertising, software, mobile payments, mapping software, retail advertising, machine learning, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, optical communications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. In addition, he has experience with data security and privacy. Prior to becoming a patent agent, Dr. Bennett was a member of the technical staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, where he developed networking protocols for wireless handsets. Dr. Bennet earned his Ph.D. and M.S. in electrical engineering in 2010 from Cornell University and his B.S. in electrical engineering from Howard University. 2-2:15 p.m. ET Break 2:15-3:30 p.m. ET Mastering Your Transition Into & Progression Through Graduate School During this panel discussion with continuing doctoral students from across the disciplines, panelists candidly discussed their experiences and strategies for making a successful transition into graduate school. They also shared insights on their experiences navigating their ongoing progression through their graduate studies and their exploration and preparation for various postgraduate career pathways. Moderator: Drea Darby, Ph.D. Candidate, Entomology Drea Darby, Ph.D. candidate in entomology, is a Ford Foundation Fellow and McNair scholar who studies the metabolic consequences of infection and the effects of high sugar diets on infection outcome in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. She is recognized for her leadership and service efforts in advancing opportunities and the well-being for historically marginalized students in academia and increasing our understanding on how science has historically been used to justify inequities in our society. Drea co-developed the Science of Bias Seminar in Fall 2020 where students learned about the historical context of bias and exploitation in science and how it persists in the present day. She served as a co-leader for the Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend, which has transformed into the institutionalized program Consider Cornell, where students from groups historically underrepresented in academia learn the ins and outs of the graduate application process. She has also served on the executive board for the Black Graduate and Professional Student Association (BGPSA) and as an active member of the Graduate and Professional Student Diversity Council (GPS-DC). Currently, she is a graduate student ambassador and a mentor in the Graduate Students Mentoring Undergraduates program within the Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives (OADI) on campus. Drea also enjoys her life as a plant and dog mom, playing video games, and watching anime. Panelists Alan Mata, Ph.D. Student, Entomology Alan Mata is a third-year Ph.D. student in the field of entomology at Cornell University. Alan serves as the SACNAS outreach chair and is a first-generation student. His research interests revolve around insect systematics (taxonomy and phylogenetics) and biogeography and studies a really cool group of flies called bee flies, which mimic bees and wasps in behavior and morphology. Furthermore, they are parasitoids of a variety of different insect groups. Given that bee flies need a lot of revisionary work, this is a good system for Alan to not only look at the biodiversity of this group but also ask some really interesting evolutionary biology questions. Alex Pasqualini, Ph.D. Candidate, Music Alex Pasqualini is a current Ph.D. candidate in music and sound studies. Their research is focused on the intersections of popular music, play, silliness, camp, activism, and queer community building, with a focus on the 1990s queer-feminist-punk music of riot grrrl and queercore. Coming from southwestern Ontario, Alex completed their bachelor’s degree in music at the University of Western Ontario and a master of arts in musicology with the collaborative sexual diversity studies program from the University of Toronto. Alex’s passion for fostering queer belonging is reflected elsewhere in their work on and off campus, such as in their work as the graduate assistant of Cornell’s LGBT Resource Center, as co-president of the QGrads and Music Graduate Student Associations, and as part of the steering committee for Transpose: Ithaca’s Queer Singer’s Alliance. Dante King, Ph.D. Student, Classics Dante is entering his third year as a Ph.D. student in interdisciplinary classics. In 2021, he earned his B.A. in classical languages magna cum laude from The College of Wooster and investigated foundation stories’ influence on and interaction with early Roman imperial society in his honors thesis, “Two Sides of the Same Coin: Vergil and Ovid’s Clashing Portrayals of Individual and Group Identity.” While Dante maintains a wide range of interests, he is most passionate about investigating visualization, the synergy of text and image, in late antique and early medieval illuminated manuscripts of the Latin west. He is currently the secretary of Cornell’s Medieval Studies Graduate Association (MSGA) and also works with Professor Emeritus Jeff Rusten on the Lexeis project, using Python to digitize single author ancient Greek lexica. Alongside his work in classics, Dante has nurtured a love of music and theatre. He has sung in various languages (including Latin), both solo and in choral environments, and acted onstage in twelve productions, including Euripides’ Medea (Jason) and Terence’s Adelphoe (Demea). Helen Stec, Ph.D. Student, Neurobiology and Behavior Helen Stec is a second-year Ph.D. student within the field of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University. They are studying brain differences between the male morphs of Poecilia parae, a species of fish closely related to the guppy. They are the chair of the Multicultural Academic Council (MAC). Kaitlin Diggins, Ph.D. Student, Plant Pathology and Plant Microbe Biology Kaitlin Diggins is from Mondamin, Iowa, and a recent graduate of Iowa State University (2022) with a bachelor’s degree in environmental science and a minor in horticulture. Kaitlin grew up on a small, diversified hobby farm in Iowa, where a deep passion for nature, science, and sustainable, small-scale agriculture was catalyzed. From there, she made it a personal goal to participate in interdisciplinary projects that work toward a sustainable future for diverse farmers. Kaitlin’s research interests evolved as she progressed through her academic career, starting in agriculture and soil science, moving to plant biochemistry and climate change, and finally progressing to integrated pest management in organic farming systems. Kaitlin is currently a second-year Ph.D. student expanding her knowledge of fungal diseases in organic vegetable systems. She is working on a collaborative project, where she will work to increase the production of organic dry beans in the Northeast by enhancing management practices for white mold caused by the fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, that causes significant damage to bean yields in the United States and worldwide.

Statement Understanding & Preparing Your Personal Statement Overview There are two types of statements included in the Graduate School’s online application, (1) the Academic Statement of Purpose and (2) the Personal Statement, both of which are required for all graduate degree programs. What Should the Personal Statement Include? Your Personal Statement should provide the admissions committee with a sense of you as a whole person, and you should use it to describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree. Additionally, it should provide insights into your potential to contribute to Cornell University’s core value to provide a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where scholars representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, abilities, and experiences can learn and work productively and positively together. Within your Personal Statement, you may also share details on lessons learned from any of your lived experiences including but not limited to being a first-generation college student or graduate (no parent/guardian completed a baccalaureate degree) racial, ethnic, and/or cultural background(s) managing a disability or chronic health condition experiencing housing, food, economic, and/or other forms of significant insecurity being a solo parent gender identity and/or sexual orientation having served in the military holding DACA, refugee, TPS, or asylee status Your Personal Statement provides you with an opportunity to share experiences that provide insights on how your personal, academic, and/or professional experiences demonstrate your ability to be both persistent and resilient, especially when navigating challenging circumstances. It also gives you an opportunity to provide examples of how you engage with others and have facilitated and/or participated in productive collaborative endeavors. Additionally, it is a place, where if necessary, you can (and should) address any blemishes, gaps, or weaknesses in your academic record. In these situations, you will want to be honest, but brief. It is best to turn negatives into positives by focusing on how you overcame obstacles, remained persistent in the pursuit of your goals, and showed resilience. Share what you learned from the particular experience, and how it led you to become a better researcher/scholar/person, etc. Content in the Personal Statement should complement rather than duplicate the content contained within the Academic Statement of Purpose, which should focus explicitly on your academic interests, previous research and/or relevant professional experience, and intended area of academic focus during your graduate studies. Why should you consider Cornell? Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Diversity & Inclusion Access & Recruitment Prospective Students Writing Your Academic Statement of Purpose Writing Your Academic Statement of Purpose What is it? Each applicant must submit an academic statement of purpose (ASOP). The ASOP is one of your primary opportunities to help the admissions committee understand your academic objectives and determine if you are a good match for the program you are applying to. The goal of this document is to impress upon the admissions committee that you have a solid background and experience in your area of interest and that you have the potential to be successful in graduate study. Why is it important? The ASOP is one of the most important pieces of your graduate school application because it: Gives the reviewers an understanding of your academic background and interests. Allows you to illustrate in your own words what sets you apart from other applicants. Helps them determine if you are a good match for the program to which you are applying. Shows your communication style and ability. Information to Include Introduce yourself and your academic interests Provide simple background information on your area of interest and how it became of particular interest to you. Here you can also share with them how and why you decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field. Describe your academic background, preparation, and training Skills you have learned from academic, lab, or research experiences (e.g., undergraduate coursework, research opportunities, scholarly writings, jobs in the field, presentations, etc.). Whenever possible, give specific examples and illustrate the points you are making, don’t just simply tell them. Research you conducted – project title or focus, research mentor, your specific role, what you learned and the outcome. If there were challenges, don’t be afraid to mention what you learned from them. This shows persistence and resilience in the face of adversity– these are also things they are looking for! Important papers or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your academic degree requirements. Relevant work or internship experience as related to the field you are applying to. Show them you are making an informed decision Indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in the discipline and are aware of research trends. Show them that you have thoroughly researched the program, its faculty, and research focus areas, and why you are applying to this program specifically. This will help you write a more informed essay that is relatable to the faculty who will be reviewing your application. Describe why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you. If there are specific faculty you are interested in working with, check the program’s ASOP instructions and determine how best to mention this in your essay. Some programs require you to name a professor(s) with whom you would like to work. Are there any aspects of the program that are of particular interest to you (immersion program, opportunities for collaboration with others outside of the institution, research centers associated with the program, etc.)? Include information that is important to you outside of the program – supportive environment for first-year students, access to amazing literary resources, opportunities to participate in professional/career development programming, etc. Professional goals – you may wish to outline what you plan to do after you complete the program as a way of underscoring the importance of your choice to pursue graduate study. Share any extracurricular opportunities you have had that show leadership, ability to work with a diverse group of people, teaching skills, etc. Research degree applicants should identify specific faculty members whose research interests align with your own interests. Important Things to Remember Details Pay attention and follow instructions very carefully – every program is different and some have specific items/topics they want you to address. Unless otherwise noted, this is an academically focused essay, not necessarily a personal essay. You will likely add some personal details here and there, but be sure to keep the focus on your academic background and future potential. Proofread and pay close attention to details – they really matter! Have others from a variety of perspectives read your essay before you submit it – they should be looking at it in terms of content, style, and grammar. Remember, those outside of your field can provide you with valuable perspective and feedback. Keep in mind that you can continue editing your ASOP after you have submitted it to programs with earlier deadlines. Length, Format and Tone Unless otherwise noted one to two pages in a standard font and size is typical. Include your full name and proposed program of study at the top of each page – if faculty are not reading an electronic version of your essay, pages can become separated. Write with confidence and in an active voice – doing this makes your sentences clear and less wordy/complicated. Language should be positive and focused.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Diversity & Inclusion Access & Recruitment Prospective Students Requesting Letters of Recommendation Requesting Letters of Recommendation Recommendation letters are a crucial piece of your graduate school application.  An effective letter should provide those making admissions decisions with an assessment of your potential as a graduate student and/or researcher. It is important that a recommendation letter be written by someone who knows you well academically.  Faculty members most commonly write letters of recommendation; however, other professionals who know you well and have supervised your work in academia or research may also be appropriate choices. Although as an applicant you cannot control a letter’s content or ensure your recommender submits the letter on time, there are things you can do to make the process as successful as possible. How you request a letter of recommendation influences the quality and type of response you receive from your recommender. Below are some tips for making your request: Ask to meet with your recommender(s) to discuss your desire to apply to graduate school. During the meeting you will have the opportunity to discuss your academic interests further, and request the letter of recommendation in person. Ask them if they are willing to write you a strong letter. Communicate with your recommenders about your goals for graduate study, your career aspirations, and how you chose your schools and programs. Give your recommenders a copy of your transcript and CV or resume. This helps them gain a better understanding of your background and interests. Provide your recommenders with the following information in a concise format: A list of the schools and programs to which you are applying, along with the deadlines and formats for submitting recommendation letters A copy of your transcript and a list of relevant courses taken Titles and abstracts of pertinent research papers you have written Honors and awards received Related academic and research activities (poster presentations, symposia, internship programs, etc.) Copies of admissions essays Give your recommenders at least several weeks’ notice. You do not want your recommenders to be rushed; instead, you want to give them enough time to write a comprehensive and accurate letter. The Cornell Graduate School application utilizes an electronic recommendation letter submission system in which applicants provide the names and contact information for their recommenders as part of the online application. Recommenders then receive an email instructing them how to submit their letter. Learn more about Cornell’s letter of recommendation requirements . Check with your recommenders to make sure they submit the letter, but do not hound them. Anything other than a positive letter has the potential to harm your application. If a recommender denies your request for a letter, thank them for their consideration and find another recommender. Make time to let your recommenders know the final outcome of your graduate school search; it is considerate and they will want to know. Why should you consider Cornell?

Thesis/Dissertation Submission of the final thesis/dissertation must be within 60 days of the final exam. Students who miss the 60 day submission deadline are ineligible to register in future terms. The Graduate School uses ProQuest to administer the electronic thesis/dissertation (ETD) submission and committee approval process that results in publication in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT) database and Cornell’s Library Repository, eCommons. Before initiating the electronic process, students are required to complete the Survey of Earned Doctorates (for doctoral students only). A SED Certification of Completion is provided to the student when the survey has been completed. Once the survey is completed, the final ETD can then be submitted to the Graduate School using the ProQuest system. The SED Certification of Completion is required for submission to ProQuest. ProQuest Submission Steps In order to complete the submission process, you will need to have the following: A single PDF file of your thesis or dissertation Your abstract Supplemental material SED Certification of Completion Step 1: Begin Submission Process Master’s students go to Cornell Master’s ProQuest site, doctoral students go to Cornell Doctoral ProQuest site. Click on the “sign up and get started today” button and follow instructions to begin the submission process. Submission Process: Submission steps are outlined on the left menu. You will see the items checked off as you progress through the submission steps. You must click “Save & Continue” at the bottom of each page, even pages on which you do not enter any information. Using the left menu, you can return to any page and make changes until the point of final submission. Step 2: Publishing Options Traditional Publishing: “Traditional Publishing” is automatically selected and is included in the Cornell Thesis and Dissertation filing fees. Delayed Release: ProQuest provides six months, and one and two year embargoes. The Graduate School recommends you discuss the publishing options with your advisor. If your advisor is unavailable or has no opinion, the conservative approach is to choose a two-year embargo. Step 3: Read and Agree to ProQuest and University Distribution License Both ProQuest and Cornell University distribution licenses will be presented for your acceptance. Step 4: Enter Thesis/Dissertation Information In addition to the mandatory information, such as title and abstract, you will have the opportunity to select up to three categories (subject areas) and six key words that describe your ETD. This information will make it easier for others to find your work when searching the web. Step 5: Upload PDF and Supplemental Files Upload PDF: Whether you use the PDF conversion tool provided by ProQuest or you convert your document to PDF yourself, review your PDF to ensure your formatting remains as you intended after conversion. Supplementary Materials: If supplementary materials – such as audio, video, and spreadsheets – are an integral part of your ETD, you can submit them as supplementary files during the online submission process. Step 6: Upload Required Documents The SED Certification of Completion if you are a Ph.D. candidate is required for submission to ProQuest. Step 7: Register for Copyright You can complete this process through ProQuest for a fee, or you complete the process independently through the U.S. Copyright Office. Step 8: Order Copies If you would like to purchase additional copies of your thesis/dissertation for yourself, your field, or your committee members, you may order bound copies through ProQuest (Order Copies page). The required bound archival copy for the library is automatically ordered for you and included in the Cornell thesis and dissertation filing fees. Select the “Decline – do not order” option if you don’t wish to order additional copies. Bound copies can also be ordered through Cornell Print Services . Step 9: Review and Submit Once the thesis editor has reviewed the formatting of your thesis/dissertation, you will receive an email to let you know whether any corrections are required. You will then have five days to make the changes and upload the revised PDF. You will not be certified for graduation until the formatting of your ETD has been fully approved by the Graduate School. You will receive a confirmation email of final acceptance. Step 10: Submitting Revised PDF (if needed) You will receive an email describing the formatting changes needed with instructions and a link for resubmission.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Thesis & Dissertation Writing from A to B Fair Use, Copyright, Patent, and Publishing Options Fair Use, Copyright, Patent, and Publishing Options Is information that you plan to include from others considered “fair use” and are you acknowledging these sources correctly? Embargo of online copies Creative Commons license Has a patent application been filed (or will one be) on the basis of your thesis or dissertation research? Register for copyright? Supplementary materials Make your work discoverable on search engines? Make your work accessible to people with visual disabilities 1. Is information that you plan to include from others considered “fair use” and are you acknowledging these sources correctly? You are responsible for acknowledging any facts, ideas, or materials of others that you include in your work. You must follow the guidelines for acknowledging the work of others in the “Code of Academic Integrity and Acknowledging the Work of Others” (published in the Policy Notebook for the Cornell Community ) . If you use any copyrighted material in the dissertation or thesis, it is your responsibility to give full credit to the author and publisher of work quoted. The acknowledgment should be placed in a footnote at the bottom of the first page of the paper or chapter. Additionally, you must determine whether use of the material can be classified as a “fair use” by performing an analysis of your use of each copyrighted item. The Cornell Copyright Information Center’s Fair Use Checklist ) is a helpful tool for performing this analysis. (See also, Copyright Law and the Doctoral Dissertation: Guidelines to Your Legal Rights and Responsibilities , published by ProQuest, or The Chicago Manual of Style , published by the University of Chicago Press.) If your use of material is not considered a “fair use,” you must obtain written permission from the copyright owner. Two copies of each permission letter must be submitted with the dissertation or thesis. ProQuest has specific requirements for the content of the permission letter. For these guidelines, consult the ProQuest Doctoral Dissertation Agreement form (published by ProQuest). If you have already published or had accepted for publication part of your own dissertation or thesis material in a journal, depending on the terms of your publication agreement, it may be necessary to write to that journal and obtain written authorization to use the material in your dissertation. 2. Embargo of online copies The value of your dissertation extends well beyond your graduation requirements. It’s important that you make an informed decision about providing online access, via ProQuest and eCommons, to your work. This decision can expand the visibility and impact of your work, but it can also shape the options available to you for publishing subsequent works based on your dissertation. ProQuest’s ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT) database indexes almost all dissertations published in the U.S. and provides subscription access online to the full text of more recent dissertations. ProQuest also sells print copies of dissertations, paying royalties to authors, when they exceed a minimum threshold. Authors retain copyright in the works they submit to ProQuest. eCommons is a service of the Cornell University Library that provides long-term, online access to Cornell-related content of enduring value. Electronic theses and dissertations deposited in eCommons, unless subject to embargo, are freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection. When submitting to eCommons, you retain copyright in your work. Ph.D. dissertations and master’s theses submitted to ProQuest are automatically submitted to eCommons, subject to the same embargo you select for ProQuest. Electronic copies of dissertations in PQDT or eCommons may be made accessible immediately upon submission or after an embargo period of six months, one year, or two years. You may wish to consider an embargo period which helps address publishers’ interests in being the first to publish scholarly books or articles, while also ensuring that scholarship is accessible to the general public within a reasonable period of time. Your decision should be made in consultation with your special committee. 3. Creative Commons license Creative Commons licenses provide authors with a straightforward and standardized means of prospectively granting certain permissions to potential users of the author’s material. Authors may request proper attribution, permit copying and the creation of derivative works, request that others share derivative works under the same terms, and allow or disallow commercial uses. Authors may even choose to place their works directly into the public domain. You will have the option of selecting a Creative Commons license when you upload your dissertation or thesis to ProQuest, and your choice will automatically be applied to the copy of your work in eCommons. 4. Has a patent application been filed (or will one be) on the basis of your thesis or dissertation research? Cornell University Policy 1.5 governs inventions and related property rights. Inventions made by faculty, staff, and students must be disclosed to the Center for Technology Licensing at Cornell University (CTL). Theses and dissertations describing patentable research should be withheld from publication, in order to avoid premature public disclosure. Use the delayed release (embargo) option if a patent application is or will be in process, noting the reason for the delay as “patent pending.” If you have any questions, please contact Cornell’s Center for Technology Licensing at 607-254-4698 or ctl-connect@cornell.edu . 5. Register for copyright? Copyright law involves many complex issues that are relevant to you as a graduate student, both in protecting your own work and in referencing the work of others. Discussion of copyright in this publication is not meant to substitute for the legal advice of qualified attorneys. A more detailed discussion of copyright law can be found in the publication from ProQuest entitled Copyright Law and the Doctoral Dissertation: Guidelines to Your Legal Rights and Responsibilities by Kenneth D. Crews. Copyright protection automatically exists from the time the work is created in fixed form and the copyright immediately becomes the property of the author. Registration with the United States Copyright Office is not required to secure copyright; rather it is a legal formality to place on public record the basic facts of a particular copyright. Although not a condition of copyright protection itself, registering the copyright is ordinarily necessary before any infringement suits can be filed in court. To register a copyright for your dissertation or thesis, register online or download printable forms . You may also request forms by mail from the Information Section, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20559, or contact them by telephone at 202-707-3000. Doctoral candidates: You may authorize ProQuest to file, on your behalf, an application for copyright registration. This option will be presented to you as part of the submission process. 6. Supplementary materials If supplementary materials (audio, video, datasets, etc., up to 2GB per file) are part of your thesis or dissertation, you may submit them as supplementary files during the online submission process. For help selecting long-lived file formats, note ProQuest’s guidance in their document, “Preparing Your Manuscript for Submission (Including Supplemental Files).” File formats for which ProQuest does not guarantee migration may still have a high likelihood of preservation in Cornell’s digital repository; please see the eCommons help page for further guidance. Do not embed media files in the PDF version of your thesis or dissertation, as this can significantly increase the size of the file and make it difficult to download and access. Include a description of each supplementary file in the abstract of your thesis or dissertation. You may include an additional supplementary file containing more detailed information about the supplementary materials as a “readme” file or other form of documentation; this is particularly advisable for data sets or code. The Research Data Management Service Group ( rdmsg-help@cornell.edu ) offers assistance in preparing and documenting data sets for online distribution. 7. Make your work discoverable on search engines? ProQuest offers authors the option of making their graduate work discoverable through major search engines including Yahoo, Google, Google Scholar, and Google Books.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Thesis & Dissertation Writing from A to B Required Sections, Guidelines, and Suggestions Required Sections, Guidelines, and Suggestions Beyond those noted on the Formatting Requirements page , the Graduate School has no additional formatting requirements. The following suggestions are based on best practices and historic requirements for dissertations and theses but are not requirements for submission of the thesis or dissertation. The Graduate School recommends that each dissertation or thesis conform to the standards of leading academic journals in your field. For both master’s and doctoral students, the same basic rules apply; however, differences exist in some limited areas, particularly in producing the abstract and filing the dissertation or thesis. Information in this guide that pertains specifically to doctoral candidates and dissertations is clearly marked with the term “ dissertation ” or “ doctoral candidates .” Information pertaining specifically to master’s candidates and theses is clearly marked with the term “ thesis ” or “ master’s candidates .” All other information pertains to both. Examples of formatting suggestions for both the dissertation and thesis are available as downloadable templates . Title Page Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: Page included in overall document, but number not typed on page. The following format for your title page is suggested, but not required. The title should be written using all capital letters, centered within the left and right margins, and spaced about 1.5 inches from the top of the page. (For an example, please see the template .) Carefully select words for the title of the dissertation or thesis to represent the subject content as accurately as possible. Words in the title are important access points to researchers who may use keyword searches to identify works in various subject areas. Use word substitutes for formulas, symbols, superscripts, Greek letters, etc. Below the title, at the vertical and horizontal center of the margins, place the following five lines (all centered): Line 1: A Dissertation [or Thesis] Line 2: Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School Line 3: of Cornell University Line 4: in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Line 5: Doctor of Philosophy [or other appropriate degree] Center the following three lines within the margins: Line 1: by Line 2: Primary or Preferred Name [as registered with the University Registrar’s Office and displayed in Student Center] Line 3: month and year of degree conferral [May, August, December; no comma between month and year] Copyright Page Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: Page included in overall document, but number not typed on page The following format for your copyright page is suggested, but not required. A notice of copyright should appear as the sole item on the page centered vertically and horizontally within the margins: © 20__ [Primary or Preferred Name [as registered with the University Registrar’s Office]. Please note that there is not usually a page heading on the copyright page. The copyright symbol is a lowercase “c,” which must be circled. (On Macs, the symbol is typed by pressing the “option” and “g” keys simultaneously. If the font does not have the © symbol, type the “c” and circle it by hand. On PCs, in the insert menu, choose “symbol,” and select the © symbol.) The date, which follows the copyright symbol, is the year of conferral of your degree. Your name follows the date. Abstract Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: Page(s) not counted, not numbered Abstract formats for the doctoral dissertation and master’s thesis differ greatly. The Graduate School recommends that you conform to the standards of leading academic journals in your field. Doctoral candidates: Usually, the heading of the abstract in a dissertation is centered between the left and right margins about 1.1 inches down from the top of the page and includes the following lines: TITLE OF DISSERTATION Student’s Primary or Preferred Name, Ph.D. [as registered with the University Registrar’s Office] Cornell University 20__ [year of conferral] Following the heading lines, begin the text of the abstract on the same page. The abstract states the problem, describes the methods and procedures used, and gives the main results or conclusions of the research. The abstract usually does not exceed 350 words in length (about one-and-one-half correctly spaced pages—but not more than two pages). Master’s candidate: In a thesis, the page heading is simply the word “ABSTRACT” in all capital letters and centered within the margins at the top of the page. (The thesis abstract does not display the thesis title, author’s name, degree, university, or date of degree conferral.) The abstract should state the problem, describe the methods and procedures used, and give the main results or conclusions. The abstract usually does not exceed 600 words in length, which is approximately two-and-one-half to three pages of correctly spaced typing. In M.F.A. theses, an abstract is not required. Biographical Sketch Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: iii (may be more than one page) Type number(s) on page(s). The following content and format are suggested: The biographical sketch is written in third-person voice and contains your educational background. Sometimes additional biographical facts are included. As a page heading, use “BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Number this page as iii. Dedication Required? Optional. Suggested numbering: iv (may be more than one page) Type number(s) on page(s). The dedication page is not required and can contain whatever text that you would like to include. Text on this page does not need to be in English. Acknowledgements Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: v (may be more than one page) Type number(s) on page(s). The following content and format are suggested, not required. The acknowledgements may be written in first-person voice. If your research has been funded by outside grants, you should check with the principal investigator of the grant regarding proper acknowledgement of the funding source. Most outside funding sources require some statement of acknowledgement of the support; some also require a disclaimer from responsibility for the results. As a page heading, use “ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Table of Contents Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: vi (may be more than one page) Type number(s) on page(s). The following are suggestions. As a page heading, use “TABLE OF CONTENTS” in all capital letters and centered on the page. List the sections/chapters of the body of the dissertation or thesis. Also, list preliminary sections starting with the biographical sketch. (Title page, copyright page, and abstract are not listed.) For theses and dissertations, the conventional format for page numbers is in a column to the right of each section/chapter title. The first page of each chapter/section is stated with a single number. Table of contents usually do not include a range of page numbers, such as 7-22. The table of contents is often single-spaced. Two-Volume Theses or Dissertations Required? Optional. If the dissertation or thesis consists of two volumes, it is recommended, but not required, that you list “Volume II” as a section in the table of contents. List of Figures, Illustrations, and Tables Required? Optional. Suggested numbering: vii (may be more than one page) If included, type number(s) on page(s). As described in the formatting requirements above, figures and tables should be consecutively numbered. The Graduate School recommends that you conform to the styles set by the leading academic journals in your field. The items below are formatting suggestions based on best practices or historic precedents. Table of contents format: As a page heading, use “LIST OF FIGURES,” “LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS,” or “LIST OF TABLES” in all capital letters, centered on the page. There should be separate pages for “LIST OF FIGURES,” “LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS,” or “LIST OF TABLES” even if there is only one example of each. The list should contain enough of the titles or descriptions so readers can locate items using the list. (It may not be necessary to include entire figure/illustration/table captions.) The list should contain the page number on which each figure, illustration, or table is found, as in a table of contents. The list of figures/illustrations/tables may be single-spaced. Page format: Figures/illustrations/tables should be placed as close as possible to their first mention in the text. They may be placed on a page with no text above or below, or placed directly into the text. If a figure/illustration/table is placed directly into the text, text may appear above or below the figure/illustration/table; no text may wrap around the figure/illustration/table. If a figure/illustration/table appears on a page without other text, it should be centered vertically within the page margins. Figures/illustrations/tables should not be placed at the end of the chapter or at the end of the dissertation or thesis. Figure/illustration/table numbering should be either continuous throughout the dissertation or thesis, or by chapter (e.g. 1.1, 1.2; 2.1, 2.2, etc.). The word “Figure,” “Illustration,” or “Table” must be spelled out (not abbreviated), and the first letter must be capitalized. A caption for a figure/illustration should be placed at the bottom of the figure/illustration. However, a caption for a table must be placed above the table. If the figure/illustration/table, not including the caption, takes up the entire page, the figure/illustration/table caption should be placed alone on the preceding page and centered vertically and horizontally within the margins. (When the caption is on a separate page, the List of Figures or List of Illustrations or List of Tables can list the page number containing the caption.) If the figure/illustration/table, not including the caption, takes up more than two pages, it should be preceded by a page consisting of the caption only. The first page of the figure/illustration/table must include the figure/illustration/table (no caption), and the second and subsequent pages must also include, at the top of the figure/illustration/table, words that indicate its continuance—for example, “Figure 5 (Continued)”—and on these pages the caption is omitted. If figures/illustrations/tables are too large, they may be reduced slightly so as to render a satisfactory product or they must either be split into several pages or be redone. If a figure/illustration/table is reduced, all lettering must be clear, readable, and large enough to be legible. All lettering, including subscripts, must still be readable when reduced 25% beyond the final version. All page margin requirements must be maintained. Page numbers and headings must not be reduced. While there are no specific rules for the typographic format of figure/illustration/table captions, a consistent format should be used throughout the dissertation or thesis. The caption of a figure/illustration/table should be single-spaced, but then captions for all figures/illustrations/tables must be single-spaced. Horizontal figures/illustrations/tables should be positioned correctly—i.e., the top of the figure/illustration/table will be at the left margin of the vertical page of the dissertation or thesis (remember: pages are bound on the left margin). Figure/illustration/table headings/captions are placed with the same orientation as the figure/illustration/table when they are on the same page as the figure/illustration/table. When they are on a separate page, headings and captions are always placed in vertical orientation, regardless of the orientation of the figure/illustration/table. Page numbers are always placed as if the figure/illustration/table was vertical on the page. Photographs should be treated as illustrations. To be considered archival, photographs must be black-and-white. (If actual color photographs are necessary, they should be accompanied by black-and-white photographs of the same subject.) Color photos obtained digitally do not need to be accompanied by a black-and-white photograph. Make a high-resolution digital version of each photograph and insert it into your electronic document, following the guideline suggestions for positioning and margins. Optional Elements List of Abbreviations As a page heading, use “LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS” in all capital letters, centered on the page. List of Symbols As a page heading, use “LIST OF SYMBOLS” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Preface Required? Optional. Suggested numbering: xi (may be more than one page) Type number(s) on page(s). As a page heading, use “PREFACE” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Body of the Dissertation or Thesis: Text Required? Yes. Suggested numbering: Begin page number at 1 Text (required) Appendix/Appendices (optional) Bibliography, References, or Works Cited (required) Please note that smaller font size may be appropriate for footnotes or other material outside of the main text. The following suggestions are based on best practice or historic precedent, but are not required. Chapter headings may be included that conform to the standard of your academic field. Textual notes that provide supplementary information, opinions, explanations, or suggestions that are not part of the text must appear at the bottom of the page as footnotes. Lengthy footnotes may be continued on the next page. Placement of footnotes at the bottom of the page ensures they will appear as close as possible to the referenced passage. Appendix (or Appendices) Required? Optional. An appendix (-ces) is not required for your thesis or dissertation. If you choose to include one, the following suggestions are based on best practice or historic precedent. As a page heading, use “APPENDIX” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Place in an appendix any material that is peripheral, but relevant, to the main text of the dissertation or thesis. Examples could include survey instruments, additional data, computer printouts, details of a procedure or analysis, a relevant paper that you wrote, etc. The appendix may include text that does not meet the general font and spacing requirements of the other sections of the dissertation or thesis. Bibliography (or References or Works Cited) Required? Yes. A bibliography, references, or works cited is required for your thesis or dissertation. Please conform to the standards of leading academic journals in your field. As a page heading, use “BIBLIOGRAPHY” (or “REFERENCES” or “WORKS CITED”) in all capital letters, centered on the page. The bibliography should always begin on a new page. Bibliographies may be single-spaced within each entry but should include 24 points of space between entries. Glossary Required? Optional. Suggested numbering: Continue page numbering from body If you choose to include a glossary, best practices and historic precedent suggest using a page heading, use “GLOSSARY” in all capital letters, centered on the page. Index Required? Optional. Suggested numbering: Continue page numbering from glossary If you choose to include one, best practices and historic precedent suggest using a page heading, use “INDEX” in all capital letters, centered on the page.

Guide to Writing Your Thesis/Dissertation Definition of Dissertation and Thesis The dissertation or thesis is a scholarly treatise that substantiates a specific point of view as a result of original research that is conducted by students during their graduate study. At Cornell, the thesis is a requirement for the receipt of the M.A. and M.S. degrees and some professional master’s degrees. The dissertation is a requirement of the Ph.D. degree. Formatting Requirement and Standards The Graduate School sets the minimum format for your thesis or dissertation, while you, your special committee, and your advisor/chair decide upon the content and length. Grammar, punctuation, spelling, and other mechanical issues are your sole responsibility. Generally, the thesis and dissertation should conform to the standards of leading academic journals in your field. The Graduate School does not monitor the thesis or dissertation for mechanics, content, or style. “Papers Option” Dissertation or Thesis A “papers option” is available only to students in certain fields, which are listed on the Fields Permitting the Use of Papers Option page , or by approved petition. If you choose the papers option, your dissertation or thesis is organized as a series of relatively independent chapters or papers that you have submitted or will be submitting to journals in the field. You must be the only author or the first author of the papers to be used in the dissertation. The papers-option dissertation or thesis must meet all format and submission requirements, and a singular referencing convention must be used throughout. ProQuest Electronic Submissions The dissertation and thesis become permanent records of your original research, and in the case of doctoral research, the Graduate School requires publication of the dissertation and abstract in its original form. All Cornell master’s theses and doctoral dissertations require an electronic submission through ProQuest, which fills orders for paper or digital copies of the thesis and dissertation and makes a digital version available online via their subscription database, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses . For master’s theses, only the abstract is available. ProQuest provides worldwide distribution of your work from the master copy. You retain control over your dissertation and are free to grant publishing rights as you see fit. The formatting requirements contained in this guide meet all ProQuest specifications. Copies of Dissertation and Thesis Copies of Ph.D. dissertations and master’s theses are also uploaded in PDF format to the Cornell Library Repository, eCommons . A print copy of each master’s thesis and doctoral dissertation is submitted to Cornell University Library by ProQuest.

Students may request a leave of absence for health, parental, or personal reasons. A leave pauses student status with the opportunity to return to the program at a set time. Leaves include: Health Leave : Taking a health leave of absence provides students with a break from their studies to attend to treatment or management of a health condition. Parental Leave : Cornell University graduate and professional students are eligible for parental accommodation to help balance the competing demands of academic and family life. Personal Leave : Under certain circumstances, students may wish to take a personal leave of absence for a non-medical and non-children-related reason. View the leaves of absence policy for more information and refer to SHP While on Leave of Absence (LOA) for insurance coverage options. Withdrawing Students may withdraw voluntarily at any time. Withdrawal is appropriate for students who do not intend to resume studies or to complete an advanced degree at Cornell University. Any interruption of registration is considered a withdrawal unless the student has been granted a leave of absence. A student holding a non-immigrant visa who withdraws is subject to the same U.S. government regulations as when applying for a leave of absence. You must notify the Graduate School at gradstudserv@cornell.edu if you wish to withdraw, take a leave of absence, or otherwise cease to be registered.

changes after you’ve enrolled, but you must obtain approval from the intended field of study and the Graduate School. If you’re an international student seeking to change to a new degree program or field of study, the Graduate School must again verify that financial support is available for the new program. If full Cornell support is not available, you will be required to provide evidence of non-Cornell financial support for yourself and any dependents who accompany you. Other Program Changes The special committee may recommend that a doctoral candidate’s degree program be changed to a master’s degree program at any time. Changes become effective prior to the start of the next term, in most cases. See the Graduate School Registrar for details.

your special committee requires approval from all members of the newly formed committee. It does not require approval from members who are leaving the committee. File these changes immediately in Student Center . For master’s students: you may make changes at any point prior to three months before the final examination by visiting your Student Center . For doctoral students: you may make changes to your special committee at any time prior to your A exam. Committee changes after your A exam require the dean’s approval. Additionally, you may not schedule your B exam within three months of a committee change. Changing Your Special Committee Chair Changing your committee chair is the same as changing any other committee member. Your director of graduate studies may ask to meet with you if you request a change of your chair, especially if such a change is requested after the A exam. Committee-Member Resignations Any member, including your chair, may resign at any time from a special committee. It is your responsibility to reconstitute your special committee. If you fail to reconstitute a committee, you will not be permitted to continue registration in the Graduate School.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) ORCID Open Researcher and Contributor ID is a persistent digital identifier for researchers and scholars. An ORCID protects scholarly identity, distinguishes researchers from one another, and links professional information, affiliations, grants, and publications. Most of the largest publishers, funders, and research institutions have adopted ORCID. Every graduate student pursuing a research degree (master’s or doctoral) is required to have an ORCID prior to the end of the second registered semester. Students must complete the registration process and grant permission to Cornell to add an “education” affiliation entry to the ORCID record. An affiliation with Cornell University signals to other systems that the information comes from an authoritative source and that they have vouched for the fact that you are (or were) indeed affiliated with them. This allows your data to be reused with a high degree of confidence when automatically filling a growing number of manuscript submission or grant application forms. Researcher control is central to ORCID. Your ORCID can be used throughout your career (as you move from institution to institution) and you control the visibility of information associated with your ORCID record. Although Cornell University will only add affiliation information to your ORCID record at this time, the permission you grant us now will allow us to add other information to your ORCID record (such as publications) in the future. We will notify you if we plan to do this. If you no longer want Cornell University to edit your ORCID record, you can revoke permission at any time. See Revoking Permission for instructions. Affiliation information added to your ORCID record is subject to ORCID’s Privacy Policy . Per this policy, you control the visibility of this information in ORCID . For more information about using your ORCID, see ORCID@Cornell . If you have questions about ORCID at Cornell University or encounter technical issues, please contact orcid-help@cornell.edu .

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research Conducting sound, responsible research is more than simply being in compliance with rules and regulations. Ethical researchers and scholars think critically about the impact of their behavior on others—their research subjects, students and trainees, advisors and other field faculty, and certainly the scientific community and society at large. Every graduate student pursuing a research degree (master’s or doctoral) is required to complete training on Responsible Conduct of Research, addressing issues of authorship, peer review, plagiarism, and research misconduct. Each student must complete online training through Cornell’s Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA) prior to the end of the second registered semester. Knowledge of institutional policy, government regulations, and the code of ethics from your discipline-specific societies will help you construct and adhere to ethical and responsible research conduct. Read the full Responsible Conduct of Research policy for detailed information.

Exceptions The Code of Legislation describes the rules and regulations governing graduate education at Cornell but a hallmark of our graduate education system is flexibility in these rules when there is a compelling need. At times, you might find that your circumstances merit an exception to a policy described in the Code. To request an exemption, you may use the General Petition form and submit supporting documentation, for example, a letter from your committee chair or a detailed academic plan. Prior to submitting the petition, you should review the Code thoroughly to make sure you understand the regulation. You will need to submit convincing evidence that your exception is required and warranted. Petition forms may be sent to the Graduate School’s Student Services office (143 Caldwell Hall or gradstudserv@cornell.edu ). If your petition is denied, you may appeal that decision to the General Committee, the governing body of the Graduate School. Examples of typical petitions: Extending the deadline to select a special committee Extending the deadline to take an A, M, or B exam Seeking additional time to complete a degree Registering in absentia while away from campus Many petitions have specialized forms to guide you through the process. Others may require you to submit a general petition form.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Making Academic Progress Taking Exams Taking Exams When and Where to Hold Exams As long as you meet the minimum number of enrolled semesters requirement you can take an exam with seven days’ notice to the Graduate School. This gives the director of graduate studies (DGS) time to announce the exam to other faculty members. Any may choose to attend. Exams, if held in person, must be held on the Ithaca campus or at a satellite campus location (including Geneva, the I.L.R. program in New York City, the Cornell Tech campus in New York City, or the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences in New York City) . However, for an exam to be held at a satellite location, the exam schedule must be posted in the Ithaca office of the field of study, as well as in the satellite location, prior to the exam. Scheduling Exams and Exam Results Students must schedule exams with the Graduate School at least seven calendar days in advance by filing the proper examination scheduling form. Scheduling forms can be found on the Forms pages . The Role of Faculty Members During Exams All members of the special committee are expected to participate in the examinations and evaluate you, the candidate. Other members of the graduate faculty are encouraged to attend exams and may question you only during the time allocated by the chair. Faculty Participation in Examinations All members of the special committee are expected participate in all examinations. At the discretion of the field demonstrated by permission from the DGS, and with the agreement of all members of the committee, exams may be held either in person or online via appropriate, high-quality electronic audio and video conferencing. When exams are held online, provisions must be made to allow other members of the graduate faculty to participate. Instructions for access to online exams must be made available to field faculty. In exceptional cases, when a faculty member is unable to participate in an exam, they may designate another member of the graduate faculty to serve as their proxy. A special committee chair may not designate a proxy; the chair must participate in the exam. If a committee has more than the required number of minor subject members, one minor member may designate another as their proxy. Exam Results Examination results must be filed with the Graduate School within three business days of the exam. Passing If you pass an exam, all members of the examining committee should report this decision to the Graduate School within three business days. No further action is required.  Enrollment in future semesters after the date a student passes their M or B exam is not permitted. Conditional Passing You may conditionally pass an exam, in which case the examining committee provides you and the Graduate School with the conditions for passing. Once these conditions are met, you pass the exam. Failing If you fail an exam, a reexamination is allowed only with the approval of the special committee. At least three months must pass from the time of the failed exam to the reexamination. Unanimously Failing If you’re unanimously failed, you must petition the General Committee to continue study. If the minor members, but not the chair, oppose allowing a reexamination; or the chair, but not all of the minor members oppose a reexamination, you must petition the General Committee to continue study. Graduate faculty members who attend the exam, but are not on the examination committee, may inform the dean in writing if they disagree with the results of the exam.

Your Thesis or Dissertation Certain special exams are required to earn an advanced degree in the research-based programs at Cornell. Often, these exams need to be taken with consideration of anticipated completion dates.  Enrollment in future semesters after the date a student passes their M or B exam is not permitted. See Taking Exams for more information. All exam forms are available on our Forms page. Exams Required for M.A. and M.S. Degree Defense If you are enrolled in an M.A. or M.S. degree program, you must pass the final examination for the master’s degree. You can take this after all degree requirements have been fulfilled, but no earlier than one month before completing the minimum number of enrolled semesters. To pass the exam unconditionally and receive a degree, all regular, proxy, and field-appointed members of the examining committee must assent that the exam was passed unconditionally. If you are enrolled in an M.S./Ph.D. degree program where the M.A. or M.S. degree is a prerequisite for your Ph.D., you may petition your special committee to approve combining the final examination for the master’s degree with the examination for the admission to candidacy. Exam forms required for the master’s degree include “Schedule Master’s Examination” and “Master’s Exam Results Form and Instructions.” Exams Required for Ph.D. Degree Defense The B exam is an oral defense of your thesis or dissertation. This exam can be taken after completing all degree requirements, but not earlier than one month before completing the minimum number of enrolled semesters. At least two semesters of successful registration must be completed between the passing of the A exam and the scheduling of the B exam. Exam forms required for the Ph.D. degree include “Schedule A Examination and Research Compliance Form,” “Schedule B Examination,” “A Exam Results Form,” and “B Exam Results Form.” Q Exam The qualifying exam, or Q exam, is required in some fields for Ph.D. applicants. This exam helps the special committee determine your ability to pursue doctoral studies, continue in a program, and tailor an appropriate program of study.

Doctoral Candidacy A Exam The A exam is also known as the examination for admission to candidacy. This oral exam may include a written component, as determined by your special committee. You can take the exam after completing two registered semesters in your program, but before beginning your seventh semester—unless special permission is obtained from the dean. Passing the A exam means the graduate faculty believes that you are ready to proceed into the dissertation phase of your degree program. Some fields may offer a special master’s degree after a doctoral candidate has completed four semesters of registration and either passed the A exam or performed at the level of an A exam. This is a master’s degree awarded to a student who is continuing on for the Ph.D., and is awarded without completion of a thesis.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Student Progress Review Student Progress Review The Student Progress Review (SPR) is an interactive process intended to support the regular exchange of constructive, written feedback between advisees and advisors. It codifies a process for research degree students and their special committees to have at least one formal conversation per year about academic progress and future plans. In academic disciplines where students are encouraged or required to complete an Individual Development Plan (IDP), the SPR process can help fulfill this need. Using the SPR form, students are asked to reflect on their recent accomplishments, identify challenges, and set goals. Committee chairs then review their students’ SPR forms and enter constructive feedback. Chairs indicate whether progress has been excellent, satisfactory, needs improvement, or is unsatisfactory. Feedback that is documented on the SPR will be made available to the student, all members of the student’s special committee, and the DGS/GFA of the student’s field. SPR Form Information SPR Form Tips for Students (PDF) SPR Form Tips for Faculty (PDF) Log into your SPR Forms Portal (for students and faculty approvers) to see forms history and forms awaiting your approval. Overview of the SPR Process Step 1: The deadline for students to complete the SPR is April 1. Each graduate field sets its own timing and annual due dates for the SPR process; fields send students instructions and a link to the SPR form at the appropriate time. Step 2: Student schedules the SPR meeting with their advisor/chair (some fields may expect that this occur in conjunction with a meeting of the special committee). Step 3: Student completes their portion of the SPR form. Depending on the field’s practices, the student may submit the form at this point or download a draft version to share with their chair and other special committee members prior to submitting the form through the online system. Step 4: SPR face-to-face dialog. Step 5: If the student saved their SPR form as a draft, they may edit the form after meeting with their chair and/or special committee. Upon submission by the student, the form is routed to the special committee chair (after this point the student cannot edit the SPR form unless it is returned to them by their chair). Step 6: The special committee chair enters written comments and evaluates student progress. Depending on the field’s practices, the chair may incorporate feedback provided by other members of the special committee and graduate field. Step 7: Contents of the form will be available to the student, the student’s special committee, DGS, and GFA. Frequently Asked Questions Who is required to complete a SPR? All M.A., M.S., and doctoral students in who are in the second year of their program or beyond must complete a SPR form each academic year. Students on leave of absence are excluded from this requirement. What is the deadline to complete the SPR? While the Graduate School simply requires that a SPR be completed once each academic year, each graduate field sets its own timeline for students and faculty to complete the SPR. The deadline for students to complete the SPR is April 1. To confirm when the SPR is due for your field please contact your GFA or DGS. How long will it take to fill out the SPR form? For most students it should not be difficult or time-consuming to complete the self-reflection and goal-setting portions of the SPR process. If you run into difficulties or have questions it may be helpful to discuss these with your advisor. The online form allows you to save your responses and return later. Some of the questions on the SPR don't seem relevant to me. What should I do? While most questions on the SPR form will be generally applicable to students across a range of fields and academic disciplines, some questions might not apply to your specific situation. It’s perfectly acceptable to note that a question is “Not Applicable,” or to contact your advisor or GFA for more specific instructions. Can a student share a draft of the SPR form with their chair/committee prior to electronically signing and submitting the finished form? Yes; students may save their SPR form as a draft (without submitting) to download and share with their chair and/or special committee via email. They may then return to the online form and edit it before electronically signing and submitting it. See the “SPR Form Tips for Students” (top of this page) for detailed instructions. Who will see content of the completed SPR form? The purpose of the SPR form is to document, in writing, a conversation that should be happening between students and their mentors, so the primary audience of the competed form is, of course, the student and the special committee. Graduate fields provide support and oversight to this advising relationship so the DGS and the GFA will also have access to completed forms. The final SPR, with comments from both the student and advisor, will be added to the student’s file. Staff of the Graduate School will not regularly review SPRs but may contact students who receive ratings of “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory” to help develop support plans. Is a SPR needed if students and their advisors already communicate on a regular basis? Most faculty advisors strive to provide regular, thoughtful feedback. However, the Graduate School has frequently heard that students expect more structured feedback in writing. This is especially important for establishing shared and agreed-upon expectations, for overcoming information that may be incorrect or misunderstood, and for when problems arise. Additionally, research suggests that “formal annual evaluations tend to increase the numbers of students who complete, and are therefore preferable to sporadic and informal reviews . . . Some form of progress-tracking, annually or each semester, allows the student and supervisor to meet and establish objectives for the year. This ensures that both students and advisors be held accountable for timely progress and for constructive feedback” (Council of Graduate Schools, Ph.D. Completion and Attrition). In the SPR process, what is the role of the special committee chair? It is expected that chairs will meet in person with their students to discuss the SPR (some fields may expect that this occur in conjunction with a meeting of the special committee). The SPR meeting provides an opportunity to discuss the student’s overall progress, provide feedback, clarify expectations, and establish shared objectives for the year. When a student electronically signs and submits the form, it is routed to their chair. After the form is submitted by the student, they are not able to make edits unless the form is returned to them by the chair using the “reject” function in the online system. Chairs are expected to complete the faculty feedback section of the form after meeting with the student. Depending on the field’s practices, the chair may also incorporate feedback from the special committee. Core questions in the faculty feedback section ask for written comments about each student’s demonstrated strength and weaknesses, as well as an overall evaluation of the student’s progress. After reviewing a student’s entries, how can the advisor/chair return the SPR form to the student for further editing? The advisor/chair may use the “return” button at the bottom of the SPR form page to send the SPR form back to the student for revisions. The chair will have the opportunity to include a message to the student (e.g., “Please revise goals for the coming year and resubmit”). What categories are used by faculty to evaluate student's overall progress? Excellent – Exceeds expectations overall; progress and performance are exceptional in one or more areas. Satisfactory – Reliably meeting expectations for academic progress and performance; planning and goal setting is realistic and appropriate. Most students who are meeting the requirements of their program, making good progress, and developing and acting on thoughtful plans and goals should be assigned this rating. Needs improvement – Academic progress and performance are not consistently of the quality needed to meet expectations. This is a signal that some changes are required to get on track for successful completion of the degree. Obstacles and challenges must be addressed through appropriate planning, goal setting, and follow-through. Sometimes a short-term disruption or setback can slow progress, but such challenges can usually be overcome with careful planning and targeted support. It’s important that students and committees develop a plan, make needed adjustments, and check-in with each other frequently. This rating should serve as a clear communication to the student that improvement is needed, and to the special committee and graduate field that monitoring and support will be needed. The Graduate School will contact the graduate field, special committee chair, and student to share information about helpful resources and best practices for developing actionable improvement plans. Unsatisfactory – Academic progress has stalled and performance is below expectations. This rating indicates that the student has made little or no academic progress in the preceding one or two semesters to the extent that lack of progress endangers their ability to complete their degree in an appropriate timeframe. Students who are rated as “unsatisfactory” are not considered to be in good academic standing with the Graduate School and may be ineligible for fellowship or assistantship support until they return to good standing. The Graduate School will require that students develop a detailed improvement plan with clear timeframes in coordination with their special committee and graduate field. The Graduate School will contact the graduate field, special committee, and student with a message noting that the student is not considered to be in good academic standing. The student will be required to submit for Graduate School approval their improvement plan and a timeline for returning to good standing, developed with input from the special committee chair. The Graduate School will enforce the terms of this plan. If the terms are not met, the student may be withdrawn from their Cornell graduate program.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Making Academic Progress Nominating Your Special Committee Nominating Your Special Committee Each student is responsible for putting together his or her own special committee, which is composed of a faculty member from your major field who will serve as your chair and additional members from any field or discipline in the university, provided they are a member of the graduate faculty. When to Select Special Committee Members You must select your special committee chair within three weeks of registering with the Graduate School. If you are uncertain of your choice for chair, you may select a temporary one or your field’s director of graduate studies (DGS) may assume the role. Deadlines for constituting a full committee depend on your expected degree. Master’s degree students must complete their special committee selection by the end of the second semester. Doctoral candidates must have a full special committee no later than the end of the third semester, although some fields have earlier requirements. Your graduate field administrator (GFA) will know for sure. Choosing a Special Committee Chair The faculty member who represents your major subject is considered the chair of your special committee. Your chair will supervise your thesis or dissertation work and will typically provide the facilities and supervision necessary to conduct your research. Your chair may serve for up to one year without special approval if he or she leaves the university. To maintain chair status, you must petition on that individual’s behalf. A retiree may continue serving as either chair or minor member. Choosing Special Committee Members You have a lot of flexibility when it comes to selecting members of your special committee. Any member of any graduate field may serve on your special committee, with occasional limits imposed on the faculty based on their field standing. Your special committee chair must be from your graduate field. At a minimum, master’s students must select one faculty member to represent their major subject (the chair) and a second member to represent their minor subject. Doctoral candidates must have one faculty member representing their major subject and two minor members, each representing one of their minor subjects. For those fields that have secured permission from the General Committee to require only one minor subject, the third member of the special committee must represent an additional concentration within your major subject. Others Who May Serve on a Special Committee Some fields require and assign a field-appointed member to special committees to help administer exams. This member serves in addition to existing committee members. If you request, and the field-appointed member agrees, this appointee may be counted as one of your selected members and serve on the special committee beyond examinations. Students may nominate non-Cornell affiliates to serve as “ad hoc” members of the special committee. They serve in addition to the required members of the Cornell graduate faculty committee and are invited to participate in committee meetings as well as exam and thesis/dissertation defenses.

Graduate Study (DGS) The faculty members in each field appoint a director of graduate studies (DGS) to represent them to the Graduate School and coordinate activities of the field. The DGS is the primary liaison between the field and the Graduate School. He or she helps establish academic priorities and allocate resources for graduate students. The DGS strives to enhance the quality of graduate education and general student welfare. These individuals also oversee the admissions process and may be the most familiar with you when you arrive. You will need to have your DGS sign any documents required by the Graduate School. Graduate Field Administrators (GFA) The graduate field administrator (GFA) helps students, faculty members, and the DGS in many ways. The GFAs serve as liaisons between students and faculty members. They are familiar with campus resources and can answer many questions about the degree process. Your GFA also can help you with paperwork and clarify your student status. Graduate School Contacts In addition to your GFA and DGS, the staff of the Graduate Student Service Office are available to assist you. They can help explain degree requirements or special procedures for circumstances such as traveling abroad, taking a leave of absence, or applying for fellowships and research grants. You should feel free to contact the Graduate School staff with problems that members of your special committee are unable or unwilling to help you solve. If you have questions, contact the Student Service Office ( gradstudserv@cornell.edu ). Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. The phone number is 607-255-5820. If the staff cannot help, you will be referred to an appropriate dean. If you feel you have a special problem, please make an appointment to see an associate dean as soon as possible. The following is a list of the Graduate School’s senior leadership: Kathryn Boor, Dean of the Graduate School and Vice Provost for Graduate Education Sara Xayarath Hernández, Associate Dean for Inclusion and Student and Faculty Engagement Jason Kahabka, Associate Dean for Administration Janna Lamey, Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life The dean is responsible for promoting the quality of graduate education and the well-being of graduate students.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Enrolling in Courses Enrolling in Courses Course enrollment refers to the process of adding, changing grading options or credit hours, or dropping classes. Course Requirements The Graduate School does not set specific course requirements for earning a degree but students are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 credits per semester. After consulting the special committee, or the advisor for a professional student, students enroll in courses appropriate to their academic program. The Graduate School does not set specific course requirements other than the student is required to enroll in a minimum of 12 credits each semester. Students not enrolling in sufficient courses must be enrolled for research using either Graduate School or, if available, departmental course numbers assigned for that purpose. Graduate School research courses will be automatically adjusted at the end of the drop period to bring total credits to 12.​ Enrolling in Courses Enrollment must be completed within 15 calendar days of the start of the semester and is accomplished using Student Center . Review Classes + Enrollment at the University Registrar’s website for enrollment dates and information. Some fields require your advisor to authorize your online enrollment. Check with your graduate field administrator (GFA) or the Office of Student Services at the Graduate School if you have trouble signing up for courses. Some courses require permission of the instructor to register. To get permission, complete a course enrollment form, available from the Graduate School, and get the signature of the course instructor. Grading Options When you enroll in a course for credit, you may be offered the option of taking it for a grade or pass/fail. Not all classes offer this option. Incompletes (INC) If you do not finish all the course work by the end of the course, the professor may assign you an incomplete (INC) and give you time to finish. However, instructors are not required to do this and may instead deduct unfinished work from your final grade. Dropping Classes or Changing Grading Options Courses can be dropped or grading options and credit hours can be changed as follows: Add/change: The last date to add a class or change credits is within 15 calendar days of the start of the semester. Drop: The last date to drop a class or change the grading basis is seven weeks after the start of the term. All drops and changes must be made through your Student Center . Please be aware that changes to course enrollment are not permitted after official course enrollment dates. In accordance with university policy, the Graduate School will only accept course enrollment petitions for truly exceptional circumstances. If you drop a course after the drop date your transcript will show a “W” signifying that you withdrew from it. The deadline to drop with a “W” is the last day of classes. Changing an ‘Incomplete’ or ‘No Grade Reported’ You have one year from the end of a course to satisfy its requirements. Once you have satisfied this requirement, your professor will change your grade from “Incomplete” (INC) or “No Grade Reported” (NGR) to a letter grade. That grade will appear with an asterisk on your transcript. If you do not satisfy course requirements, the INC or NGR becomes a permanent part of the transcript. You can retake the course, but both the INC or NGR and the most recent grade will be on your transcript. Auditing Classes Auditing a class means you regularly attend the class, but do not participate in all aspects of the course. You won’t receive any credit hours and the course will be marked with a “V” on your transcript. Some courses do not lend themselves to auditing, and in such cases instructors may not allow it. Graduate students may enroll in any course offered by the university, though some courses impose restrictions or prerequisites. Your special committee may want you to concentrate solely on your research, so you should discuss potential elective courses with your committee members. Part-Time Study Generally, part-time study is not permitted except under the following circumstances: A Cornell University staff member may be eligible to apply for graduate admission to research and professional degree programs as part of the Employee Degree Program (EDP). While participating in the EDP, the staff member continues to work full-time and completes courses and degree requirements part-time. Established Ithaca-area residents may be admitted on a part-time basis to both research master’s and professional master’s degree programs. Study for a doctorate, however, may not be conducted in this manner. Graduate fields must accept or reject applicants seeking admission for part-time study following the same admissions standards as are applied to applicants for full-time study. This program is not to be used for applicants who were refused admission to full-time study.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Requirements Academic Structure Academic Structure Fields of Study At Cornell, graduate study is organized using a field structure. Fields are composed of faculty members from a number of departments who come together around a shared intellectual interest and may draw from different campuses or colleges. Graduate students are admitted to fields of study. Within each field, they select major and minor subjects, which are research interests or concentrations. Majors and Minors At Cornell, students are accepted into fields of study. Within each field are major subjects and areas of concentration. A major, like its undergraduate cousin, is a focused subject area where a student will conduct his or her research or scholarship. Concentrations are a subset within the major subject. Minor subjects are secondary areas of research. Some fields offer minor subjects only. Determining Your Major and Minor Subject Requirements Master’s degree students choose one major and one minor subject. Doctoral candidates choose one major and two minor subjects of study, although some fields have permission from the General Committee to require only one major and one minor subject. Faculty members are picked from these approved subjects to form a “special committee.” Special Committees If you are in a research-based degree program, you will select a special committee chair and additional faculty members to create a special committee. The special committee is responsible for helping you develop your research and academic program. The Graduate School imposes no requirements for courses or grades; your special committee will ensure you make appropriate progress and achievement. The timeline and process for composing special committees may vary by field. Your DGS and GFA can clarify the process for your field of study. To choose or change an advisor, you may submit a request online from the “Advisor” section of your Student Center .

In most years, the deadline is April 15, unless that date falls on a weekend or holiday. What is taxable income? At the graduate level, all fellowship and assistantship stipends are considered taxable income by the IRS and by New York state. For U.S. citizens, fellowship stipends do not generally have tax taken out at the time of payment. However, the IRS requires Cornell to withhold 14% in taxes from stipends paid to “non-resident aliens” (international students), unless the student is eligible for exemption under a tax treaty. All students are expected to report the stipend and taxable income on their tax return forms. For graduate student assistantship stipends, taxes are withheld at the time of disbursement and the stipend amount is reported to the IRS by Cornell. Graduate students may exclude from income monies spent for tuition and fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses. Tax treatment of specific items may change from year to year. It’s important to visit the IRS website for the most recent regulations. International students may or may not pay taxes on fellowship stipends depending on the specific provisions of the tax treaty between their home country and the United States. Please consult with a tax expert well in advance of the tax due date, which is generally on or around April 15. Student loans are not considered taxable income. Each student is responsible for determining how the tax law applies to his or her own situation. For more information about taxes and links to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), please visit Cornell’s tax issues FAQ for students . What types of taxes do I need to pay? This depends on your individual circumstances and your legal residence. How do I get started? Go to Student Center to make sure your address on record is accurate. If you received any funds through the university, you will receive tax documents detailing what you received. Domestic students should have received most of them by January 31. International students will receive their documents soon. Collect your documents and any other statements you might have received. For example, your bank may have sent you a statement depending on the type of account you have and the bank’s location. How you file will depend on your residency. Domestic students: IRS Free File may be utilized if adjusted gross income (AGI) is $73,000 or less. You may want to work with a tax preparer. If so, follow the tips listed below. International students: The Office of Global Learning provides free tax preparation software for international students. (Turbo Tax and other products do not include the right forms for international students.) Where can I get help preparing taxes? For international students: Tax information for International Students –  Global Learning provides free tax preparation software for international students. (Turbo Tax and other products do not include the right forms for international students, do not use them.) Tax preparation from Alternatives Credit Union : Alternatives Federal Credit Union offers free tax preparation for those who qualify. If your income is less than $60,000, you could be eligible. If you decide to work with a tax preparer, please follow these tips: Check the preparer’s qualifications Check the preparer’s history Ask about service fees Ask to e-file Make sure the preparer is available Provide records and receipts Never sign a blank return Review before signing Ensure the preparer signs and includes their PTIN Source and more information What is the outcome after I file my taxes? There are generally two outcomes. You will need to either pay taxes if you did not pay enough during the previous calendar year. Or, if you overpaid your tax burden, you will receive a tax refund. My friends pay less tax than me. Why? Taxes are highly individualized based on many factors that vary greatly even between two people in similar circumstances. Your salary and withholding tax are only two pieces of a much bigger puzzle. Income, deductions, number of exemptions, tax credits, phase-out of exemptions, deductions, and credits, as well as withholding and estimated tax payments, are all factors in determining the amount of your refund or (gasp!) the amount you owe the government at year end. Your annual income tax calculation starts with ALL sources of taxable income for the year. In addition to your weekly paycheck, this can include a spouse’s salary, interest, dividends, capital gains or losses, unemployment, retirement distributions, social security, rental income, small business income, cancelled debts, alimony, gambling winnings, and even bribes! You also have adjustments to income. Depending on your situation, these could include deductions for traditional IRA contributions, student loan interest deduction, alimony paid, and others. Where do I learn more about taxes? See the list of websites on the Graduate School’s Tax Information page.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Tax Information Understanding the 1098-T Form Understanding the 1098-T Form Students receive a form 1098-T that is generated by the university in order to claim certain educational credits. While Cornell staff are not legally able to provide tax advice because each student’s circumstances will be different, we can explain what you can expect to see in the boxes and what that information might mean. Only a trained, certified tax advisor can provide appropriate individual guidance for you. It’s important to remember that the 1098-T is an information form only and does not directly define taxable income or eligibility for a credit. Students may need to provide copies of their bursar bill to their tax preparer to confirm the dates that stipends were refunded. Box 1 displays the total tuition costs and required fees that were paid during the tax year. Some students who self-pay these expenses may be able to claim a tax credit such as the American Opportunity Credit, the Hope Credit, or the Lifetime Learning Credit, based on this amount. Student Health Plan costs are not included in box 2. Box 5 displays the total of all scholarship and fellowship awards. Note: Students who receive scholarship or fellowship will see the sum of their eligible awards reported in box 5 on the 1098-T.  Fellowship and scholarship support is generally tax-free when applied specifically to the cost of tuition, required fees, books, and some required course supplies or equipment. Health insurance is not typically considered to be a “required fee” because at Cornell, like most universities, students must have insurance but not all students are required to buy the policy if they have another acceptable plan. Perhaps you’ve seen online discussions suggesting that even experts don’t always agree on this. If you are working with a tax advisor you can refer her or him to University Policy 1.3 on graduate assistantships. It describes how Cornell assistantships both require and provide coverage in the Student Health Plan, as a condition of the appointment, but not specifically as a condition of being a Ph.D. student.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Fellowships External Fellowships Financial Supplementation of External Fellowships Financial Supplementation of External Fellowships Cornell University Graduate School strongly encourages students to apply for external fellowships and grants. These may be offered by government agencies, private foundations, or corporations, and may provide one year or multiple years of support. To encourage doctoral students, in particular, to compete for external awards, the Graduate School may be able to provide top-off supplementation to bring an award to the minimum academic year stipend. If the following criteria are met, the Graduate School will coordinate supplementation of the stipend to the academic year TA rate, individual health insurance, and tuition. Eligibility criteria: Students must be research degree students in good academic standing. The award is external to Cornell; has been won by the student’s own initiative; and is open to multiple disciplines or fields. The award provides an amount equal to at least half of the cost of academic year TA stipend and health insurance . (It is estimated that the award eligibility amount for academic year 2024-2025 will be around $19,000). Fellowship top-off is not available to master’s students after the eighth registered semester or Ph.D. students after the 14th registered semester. Students must apply for top-off in the same year that the fellowship is won. A top-off cannot be applied retroactively. The award must directly support the student’s dissertation and thesis research. Awards that require a student to perform a service, engage in teaching, or conduct research not related to the student’s dissertation or thesis research, do not qualify for supplementation. Additional information: Awards that cover a 12-month period will be prorated to a nine-month standard. Awards that come in a “lump sum” will be apportioned to cover a percentage each of stipend, tuition, and health insurance. Awards that are funded in a foreign currency will be calculated using the published currency exchange rate on June 1 of that year. Supplementation is calculated by considering all awards granted for the academic year or 12-month period.  If additional awards are granted after the initial calculation, supplementation amounts are recalculated. Certain exceptional external awards provide full coverage of all necessary living expenses and surpass the required stipend amount. Awards exceeding the base stipend amount may be allocated across additional semesters or utilized to offset essential billed costs, such as health insurance or tuition. These types of awards may not qualify for supplementation. By accepting and receiving fellowship supplementation, fellows are consenting to the review and approval of their budgets by the Office of Graduate Fellowships and Funding. Although the current award amount provided by the SSHRC and NSERC Doctoral Fellowships fall below the required eligibility guidelines for supplemental funding, the graduate school will offer one semester of supplemental funding to research students who meet the eligibility guidelines. Supplemental funding for the SSHRC and NSERC Fellowships will be provided in the Spring semesters with the expectation that disbursements received from the fellowship during the Fall semesters will used for Spring semester funding. Recipients of the SSHRC and NSERC awards should plan for an assistantship in the Fall semester and are encouraged to communicate this to their fields. Please reach out to your GFA to apply for supplemental funding. For questions regarding this program, please contact the Office of Graduate Fellowships and Funding grad_funding@cornell.edu .

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Fellowships External Fellowships Writing Your Research Statement Writing Your Research Statement Set yourself apart Most reviewers volunteer their time. Faced with a huge pile of applications, they’ll move quickly and won’t take time to search out hidden answers. In reviewing your application, the reader will scan for clear answers to three questions: What new knowledge will be generated for the discipline? Why is it valuable? How can they be assured the conclusions will be valid? You want to make sure that the reviewer will be left with something to remember: a message that will remain after reading many other proposals. Make sure your proposal is clear and has a strong opening paragraph that will grab the reader’s attention. Your statement should tell a compelling story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Avoid jargon Always keep in mind that reviewers may not be experts in your particular research area. It is essential that you couch your proposal in language and a narrative that will be accessible to an intelligent but non-specialized reviewer. In particular, don’t use jargon. Eliminate any theoretical discourse that is only accessible to those trained in your area. Keep the spotlight on ideas Start with a subject that interests you – a research proposal or a question – and develop a good proposal around it. Don’t worry if your proposed research project isn’t the “hot” topic in the field right now. In fact, an off-the-beaten-path project may stand out among all the other applications. Show the reviewer that you are ready to take on the challenge of independent research; that you have not only a strong foundation for research as evidenced by a knowledge of the core scholarly publications in your discipline, but also that you possess the creativity, passion, and drive that will take you from more passive learning to active invention and hypothesis. Be clear about how you will undertake the research and how you will analyze the results. Argue why you think this is the best approach to the problem. Explain which approaches are standard and which are innovative. The way you formulate your questions and describe how you will address them will reveal a lot to the review committee about your thought processes. Your proposal is not the same as a final plan If you’re a first-year student, remember that you’re writing a proposal: you are not committed to following the exact path you establish in your proposal. Most funding agencies expect that your project will change as you get underway. The important thing is to show that you’ll be capable of carrying out research in the discipline area proposed given the resources available to you. Applying for dissertation-year fellowships If you’re applying for a dissertation-year fellowship, the bar has been raised. Given your breadth of experience, the reviewers will expect to see more from you than they will from a first-year student. Reviewers will want to see that you’ve taken an interest in your professional development by presenting at national conferences and by having publications accepted to peer-review journals or in process, so be sure to address those issues. Seek input Discuss your research proposal with your special committee chair, your director of graduate studies, faculty in your field, and other students. If you can identify students who have had successful proposals or faculty who have served as adjudicators, ask them. It’s okay to tailor your research statement to present the version most likely to win the fellowship. Focus on the aspects of your project that are the best fit with the sponsoring agency’s stated goals for the fellowship program. If you need inspiration, check out the reference notebooks of successful applications available in 350 Caldwell Hall. Details matter, so sweat them Your bibliography is important. This is where you will show experts in your field that you know the discipline and that you’ve done your homework. Make sure you cover the key papers in your discipline, but don’t make the bibliography too long. Reviewers want to see that you can distinguish between the most important contributions and secondary papers. A good bibliography shows you know enough about the discipline to avoid duplicating other work. Proof your work Make sure that there are no typographical or grammatical errors and follow the guidelines carefully. Your statements reflect on the level of professionalism you will bring to your research. When the competition is extreme, reviewers look for clues that differentiate one application from another. Typographical errors, grammatical errors, and inattention to guidelines will create suspicion over your attention to detail and will probably result in your application being passed over. Allow enough time You need to be exceptional in an excellent group of applicants. A good proposal may take up to three months to develop. Write a draft, seek input from others, revise, set it aside, come back to it, revise again, seek input again. Keep working until you have a polished product. If you put in the time to make your proposal as good as it can be, it will show in the end result and your application will be more competitive.

Letters of recommendation are important and they should be written by people who know you and your research well. Who should write my letter of recommendation? Choose someone who know can speak knowledgeably and enthusiastically about you and your research. It’s more important that your references know you than it is for them to be a “name” in the field. Can I use references from my undergraduate institution? If you’re a new graduate student, your faculty supervisor for undergraduate experiences in the laboratory or summer projects are good bets for the letter of recommendation – just be sure they know you and your research. What can I do as a first-year student to help faculty get to know me better? Cornell faculty are friendly and open to becoming acquainted with graduate students. Take advantage of office hours, seminars, lunches with department faculty, and other opportunities to start a one-on-one conversation. Before talking with faculty, find out more about their research and be ready to talk about how their research interests relate to yours. Cornell faculty have committed themselves to developing the next generation of scholars. They want you to be successful and most will be happy to help. How can I help my recommenders write a strong letter? Once you’ve selected your recommenders, make it easy for them to present you in the best possible light: Ask them what they will need from you. If they can’t indicate in their letter that they support your research, look for another recommender. Supply them with a copy of your transcript. Give them a copy of your proposal. Know the deadline for their letters (it may be different from the application due date) and remind them as it draws near; don’t wait until the day before the deadline to ask if they’ve submitted the letter. Give them an idea of what you’d like them to emphasize in their letters; it’s okay for you to suggest a focus.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Fellowships External Fellowships Fellowship Resources and Workshops Fellowship Resources and Workshops Each year, research degree students at Cornell University secure hundreds of external fellowships, generating more than $15 million in fellowship funding to bolster graduate research and further the university’s mission. Winning external fellowships is a remarkable achievement that not only recognizes a research student’s exceptional skills and potential but also opens doors to incredible opportunities for growth. Securing such prestigious awards often involves a highly competitive selection process. To support our graduate students, Cornell’s Graduate School puts together a compilation of sample essays from past fellowship winners for current graduate students to review as they prepare their applications.   To access these samples, please enter the External Fellowship Portal while logged in with your Cornell Net ID. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Sessions Graduate students in eligible fields should apply in either their first or second year of graduate school for an NSF GRFP . The fellowship includes three years of financial support. Check the NSF GRFP website for upcoming information sessions. Assistance with Graduate Fellowship Applications If you need additional assistance with your graduate fellowship application after our fellowship workshops and review sessions have concluded or are unable to attend a session, here are some options: Many fellowship competitions list either faculty, reviewers from previous years’ competitions, or current fellowship recipients who may be contacted to answer your questions. (As the fellowship application deadline approaches, be prepared that the person you contact may not be able to respond to further questions or take on additional requests for reviews.) As an example, the AAUW lists current fellowship recipients . Contact those at your institution and ask if they have time to answer your questions. NSF lists faculty contacts at most institutions as well. Seek out advanced graduate students in your field (or a related field) who have applied for the same fellowship competition. They may be willing to answer your questions or, if they have the time, to offer some feedback on your draft. (The earlier in the semester you ask, the better.) Ask peers and friends for feedback on your essay drafts. One faculty reviewer for the NSF GRFP has said, “Almost all research statements are good enough. It’s the personal statements that really need work, i.e., more compelling writing to tell a persuasive story, more editing and polishing.” If your faculty advisor provides useful comments on the research statement, then even friends who are not specialists in your specific field or subfield can provide feedback on your personal statement. Get reviews from multiple peers, especially from those who have previously applied. Use Cornell’s Graduate Writing Service for additional help. If you are a Cornell international student, you have an additional resource, the English Language Support Office , to provide help with your writing. (Sign up early in the semester if you plan to have drafts ready for review; appointments from mid-semester to end of the term fill quickly.)

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Fellowships External Fellowships External Fellowships Cornell students have been highly successful in competing for external fellowships (those awarded by outside agencies such as the NSF, Javits, or the Social Science Research Council). Students are encouraged to work with their director of graduate studies (DGS) and/or special committee chair to develop effective application materials. Even if you have a funding guarantee from Cornell, there are compelling reasons to apply for a competitive external fellowship. Why apply? A competitive external fellowship is an honor that will stay with you throughout your career. Distinguish your CV when you enter the job market. Clarify your thinking about your research and expose you to valuable feedback. Increase your flexibility in selecting advisors, choosing research projects, and conducting field work. Help faculty support more students by bringing your own funding to a field. Who’s eligible? Most fellowship competitions are open to first-year students or dissertation-year students. When should I start the process? Right away. If you’re a first-year student, don’t hold off on applying because you haven’t finalized your plans. You were accepted into a Cornell graduate program because you have excellent credentials and scholarly promise. Reviewers won’t expect first-semester students to have all the project details worked out. Where should I start researching awards? To find out about the vast array of awards that will be appropriate for you, talk with your DGS and other students in your field. UCLA’s fellowship database also offers an extensive list of external fellowship opportunities to consider. Are there steps I can take that will aid my research? Agencies want the best possible proposals, so don’t be afraid to ask appropriate, substantive questions during the application process. All things being equal, the agency will fund applications that address their unspoken needs and norms as well as the overt rules; speaking with the funding agency and faculty who have interacted with the organization will give you special insights. Look for more support on fellowship writing through workshops. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

opportunities available to incoming students: Cornell and Sage Fellowships Diversity Fellowships Thanks to Scandinavia Fellowship Cornell and Sage Fellowships Approximately 20 percent of our doctoral students studying on campus receive Cornell University Fellowships (referred to as Cornell Fellowships or Sage Fellowships depending on the field of study). These fellowships typically include full tuition, a nine-month stipend, and Cornell individual student health insurance. A summer stipend may also be provided to students. How to apply: Cornell University Fellowships are awarded at the time of admission; continuing students are ineligible to apply. Prospective students apply for fellowships on the admissions application. To be considered for a university fellowship, respond “yes” to the question on the admissions application asking if you wish to be considered for university assistantships and fellowships. Award process: The graduate field to which you are applying will consider your eligibility for fellowships based on your application; no additional information is required. Notification: Admitted Ph.D. students will be notified of any fellowship awards as part of the admissions offer. Cornell Fellowship The Cornell Fellowships provide one semester or one academic year of funding, including stipend, tuition, and individual health insurance. This award is taken in the first year, unless otherwise noted by your field. These fellowships may be awarded to U.S. students, permanent residents, or international students. Sage Fellowship The Sage Fellowships are two-year fellowships—first year and then dissertation year—with four summers of funding. These include a stipend, tuition, and individual health insurance.  Sage fellowships cannot be stacked with another fellowship in the same academic year. Students are not eligible for fellowship funding after completing the B-exam. Sage Fellowship requirements also apply to Deans Excellence Fellows in Sage fields. Sage Requirements: Students in the arts and humanities and certain humanistic social sciences are awarded four summers of funding with the stipulation that they actively pursue their scholarship over the summer and maintain satisfactory academic progress. Students will be eligible for the first and second summers of funding only if they file with the Graduate School by May 1 of that year an academic plan describing the anticipated summer academic activities and outcomes. To be eligible for second-summer funding, a student must have assembled the special committee before the end of the third semester of registration, as required in the Code of Legislation (and must file an academic plan by May 1, as above). Students will be eligible for third-summer funding only if they have passed the A exam or have filed an exam scheduling form by May 1 of that year that indicates they are scheduled to attempt the A exam prior to the start of their seventh semester of enrollment, as required in the Code of Legislation, and if they have filed with the Graduate School by May 1 an academic plan describing anticipated summer academic activities and outcomes. Students will be eligible for fourth-summer funding only after passing the A exam and only by application. A student must submit an application to the Graduate School for fourth summer of support by May 1 of that year, describing the scholarly work completed with the third summer of support and stating the academic objectives to be undertaken during the fourth summer. Graduate School staff will review the applications. The dissertation-year fellowship will be available only to students who have passed the A exam. In addition, students seeking the dissertation-year fellowship must have written and submitted an external fellowship or grant proposal before the dissertation-year fellowship is awarded to encourage all students to pursue external funding. (In exceptional cases for which there may be no logical external funding organization to which it would be appropriate to write a proposal, the student may write a proposal for an internal Cornell award such as a Graduate School or Einaudi travel grant or may petition for permission to complete an alternative professionalization activity.) No portion of the dissertation-year fellowship may be used by the student later than the 12th semester of enrollment, unless the student had secured external funding in an earlier term, in which case one or two semesters of dissertation-year fellowship may be used after the 12th semester corresponding with the length of external funding (one semester if one semester external funding had been secured, or two semesters if at least two semesters of external funding had been secured). All students are expected to complete their degree within the first fourteen semesters of enrollment, funding is not extended past the seventh year of doctoral study.  Exceptions to this requirement will be considered on an individual basis and should be directed to the Graduate School’s associate dean for administration.

the Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment, prepares a student expense budget defining standard allowances for education costs for graduate and professional students. Tuition and other budget figures for the academic year are listed Graduate Students page of the Financial Aid website . Please note: housing, dining, and personal expenses will be higher for programs offered in NYC. The cost of attendance reflects estimated expenses prior to financial aid. Please review a detailed breakdown of the estimated cost of attendance and reference the Financial Aid FAQ for more information. Housing and Dining (Room & Board) The housing and dining allowances should permit a student comfortable, but modest, housing and a balanced diet. Your living costs will depend on your lifestyle and living arrangements. Discretionary lifestyle choices cannot be subsidized by federal or private education loans. Books and Supplies The allowance for books and supplies is sufficient for the purchase of all required books and supplies. Personal and Miscellaneous Expenses The personal allowance covers necessary student-related living expenses other than room and board and student health insurance, such as routine costs of transportation to and from campus (including parking fees) and basic telephone service. Budgeting Your education-related costs may be different from the budget we use for financial aid purposes. Please remember that you cannot use education loans (even private education loans) to cover costs above our published budget. You may have to plan carefully to ensure that you can meet all your expenses during the year. Additional Expenses Additional expenses, up to but not exceeding the amount listed below, can be used to increase the cost-of-attendance amount. However, this is determined on a case-by-case basis after a student submits appropriate documentation and completes the budget-increase form, available on the Financial Aid website.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Admitted Students Living in Ithaca Housing Tips Housing Tips The Graduate School hosts a webinar with the Office of Off-campus Housing to help new students find housing options. Current students answer questions and provide tips on finding good housing. Below is a compendium of tips from current students. View 2018’s webinar or 2020’s webinar . Research Try to connect with current students in your field. They can offer feedback on neighborhoods and the local housing market. I was too nervous to ask at first, but I’m glad I did. Be open minded, flexible, and enterprising. Put in the time to do your research and reach out to people: be it landlords or people in similar situations as you to ask for the specificity of the description of what you are looking for. Ithacans are always ready and willing to help. Craigslist and Other Sources Craigslist is worth a look with great deals, even on one-bedrooms and studios. Look for opportunities on social media and talk to people. Look your house up on Google maps. Look at it on street view; explore what is nearby (grocery shops, bus stops, restaurants). Use Reddit to ask questions about neighbors, noise, the atmosphere of the region. Craigslist is a valid search engine to find legitimate housing. The Cornell Facebook page for housing is more reliable as the students themselves sublet some apartments. They give a much more realistic picture of how the apartment looks compared to websites like Craigslist. Finding a Good Location Think about what you like to do outside of work/school and what you would like to live near/what you want your neighborhood to be like. Think hard about how important distance from campus vs price/apt quality is to you, because it will almost certainly be a major consideration when comparing apartments. Think carefully about how often you expect to be on campus. For students working in labs, you may need to get onto campus at odd hours. Living closer to campus should definitely be a priority. There are hills here. Steep hills. Do not assume you can ride a bike easily to campus. Make sure public transit is available if you need it. How close do you want to be to the social lifeline of Ithaca? If you’re looking for ‘nightlife’, consider an apartment near the Commons. If you’re looking for something more peaceful – and cheaper – look at apartments in Fall Creek or in Lansing. Living further away from campus can also save money on rent, but it can be difficult because the bus lines don’t run as frequently to these locations, and parking on campus is expensive. Looking at Apartments Try to set up a Skype tour of the residence and/or a Skype interview with the owner or current residence if you are not able to see it in person or the residence is not a new build. You want to make sure you are living in a good environment and with people around whom you are comfortable living. Most of the time you get what you pay for, so make sure you know why the rent is so cheap or expensive before making any decisions Check out the neighborhood around the residence. Do a Google street-view. Look at the neighborhood websites, Facebook pages, etc. Ask yourself: “Would I be happy and feel comfortable living in this neighborhood?” Keep in mind the age of the house; older properties may not be well-insulated. Make sure to ask for as many pictures as possible. Sometimes, landlords can make it tricky. Timing Start early and look in person if you can. Look earlier rather than later. Space fills up fast, so definitely start making moves to secure housing as quickly as you can. Signing Negotiate for two-year term to get a better deal. Don’t be afraid to dispute a clause in a lease before you sign. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of current graduate students/other people in Ithaca before signing a lease. Furnishing Your Apartment Look up the Ithaca Reuse store for decent quality economic household goods. Give back when you leave. Try to get a furnished apartment so that you don’t have to worry about basic furniture. Roommates Be critical of not only the place, but also the possible people you will be living with, roommates can make or break a living situation. The best living situation is to split an entire house with friends Living with roommates will save you a lot of money, especially in Ithaca. Why should you consider Cornell?

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Admitted Students Living in Ithaca Housing Housing University Housing Approximately 5% of graduate students live in university housing. Cornell’s graduate and professional student residences offer many opportunities that off-campus housing may not. The multinational graduate school communities are in close proximity to campus facilities, libraries, and classrooms. The largest residence, Hasbrouck Apartments , has a community center with television rooms, a service center, study and meeting rooms, laundry areas, vending machines, and recreational facilities. Living arrangements are available to accommodate single students and students with families. The Housing Office assigns housing on a first-come, first-served basis, so place your request early. Off-Campus Housing Most of Cornell’s graduate students live in the Ithaca area in residences that are not university-owned. Many areas around the Cornell campus are within walking distance, so owning a car may not be a necessity; however, the hills in Ithaca can make walking to and from certain areas difficult at times. Not having a car can also restrict access to shopping and other area services. Although the Ithaca area does have public transportation and CarShare, service is limited in certain areas and on weekends. As with on-campus housing, it is better to look for off-campus housing early. Available housing includes apartment complexes, multiple-unit houses, single-unit houses, room rentals, mobile homes, lake houses, and cooperative living units. Ithaca’s neighborhoods and the surrounding region have distinct characteristics that are best investigated in person. Cornell’s Off-Campus Living Office website provides apartment listings and excellent advice about searching for housing, understanding lease terms, and interacting with landlords. Off-Campus Neighborhoods Collegetown Abutting the southwest end of the Cornell campus, Collegetown is akin to a miniature city featuring shopping, restaurants, and other services. This convenient location is very popular with students (mostly undergraduate), which increases rent, noise, and congestion. Living in the lower Collegetown area provides good exercise because you’ll have to walk uphill to campus; you’ll also be close to downtown’s shops and restaurants. Luxury/average apartment complexes, multiple-unit houses, and room rentals prevail in this area. (Up to a 15-minute walk to campus.) East Hill and Belle Sherman Located just east of Collegetown, this residential area is a mix of family homes and a few apartment complexes. This neighborhoods tends to be quieter, and is within walking distance of the shops, grocery stores, and other services of East Hill Plaza, Judd Falls Plaza, and Collegetown. (A 15-minute mostly level walk to campus.) Downtown and Fall Creek These peaceful residential neighborhoods are located at the base of East Hill. They are within walking distance of the Commons, public library, shopping, parks, and other city services. Many graduate students prefer this area for its lower rents and city neighborhood feel. Most of the rental units are subdivided houses, single-unit houses, or apartments over shops. Bus service is frequent in this area. (A 20 to 30-minute uphill walk to campus.) Cornell Heights/Cayuga Heights Both historic neighborhoods border the Cornell campus to the north. Cornell Heights contains some apartment buildings and apartments within houses. It is also home to many fraternities and sororities, so residents are at times subjected to loud music and parties. Cayuga Heights is a residential area where many faculty live. The neighborhood has a few apartment complexes and rooms/apartments within houses. Walkable shopping areas and other conveniences are somewhat limited. (Up to a 30-minute level walk to campus.) Northeast and Lansing North of Cayuga Heights, this suburban area includes varied large and small apartment complexes, residential neighborhoods, and retail areas (The Shops at Ithaca Mall, Triphammer Marketplace, and Cayuga Mall). Somewhat remote from campus, this area also tends to be less expensive. Bus lines run regularly. (Lengthy, level walk to campus; bus or car recommended.) South Hill South Hill is home to Ithaca College (IC), and IC students inhabit many of its apartment complexes. Although less convenient for Cornell students without cars because of its distance to campus, some graduate students choose to live here and walk to downtown Ithaca, then take public transportation to campus. (A 15-minute downhill walk to downtown; 10-minute bus ride to campus.) West Hill and Cayuga Lake (West Shore) Although living on the lake has obvious aesthetic and warm-weather benefits, these are inconvenient residential areas for Cornell students. Rent tends to be less expensive, but winter heating bills can be astronomical. Be aware that units advertised as “cottages” are probably not insulated; “houses” probably are. Check with New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG, 800-572-1111) for average yearly heating bills. Few buses run here. Farther Afield Because of the lower rent and more rural atmosphere, among other reasons, some graduate students choose to live in areas surrounding Ithaca. All require a commute by car or by public transportation (which runs less frequently in outlying areas). Some towns and villages nearby include: Brooktondale, Candor, Danby, Dryden, Groton, Lansing, Newfield, and Trumansburg. Why should you consider Cornell?

Ithaca is located in central New York at the southern tip of Cayuga Lake, approximately four hours north of New York City and south of Toronto. Visiting Cornell Visitor Information : directions, local hotels, and more Tompkins County Visitor Information : directions, transportation, hotels, restaurants, and more Campus-to-Campus : Express bus service between Cornell’s New York City and Ithaca campuses Automobile Rental A number of auto-rental businesses serve the Ithaca area, including Affordable Used Car Rental of Ithaca (607-273-1300); Autorental America ; Avis (airport); Enterprise ; Hertz (airport); and National . Getting Around TCAT Bus (607-277-RIDE) Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) operates 37 routes serving the Cornell campus, Ithaca, and the surrounding communities. Exact change is required for the $1.50 fare (including one transfer). Cornell’s “Blue Light Bus” service offers free admittance for Cornell ID-holders on TCAT’s night-time Routes 92 and 93, which serve the campus and its fringes. Frequent riders may purchase economical system-wide passes, available at supermarkets, City Hall, and Cornell’s Willard Straight Hall, among other locations. Most TCAT buses are handicapped-accessible, and TCAT offers special paratransit services for people with disabilities (607-273-1878). All TCAT buses are equipped with two front-mounted bike racks, which give bicycling commuters more options. *All registered Cornell students receive unlimited rides on all TCAT buses after 6 p.m. weekdays, and anytime Saturday and Sunday when using their CU ID card at the farebox.* Walking and Biking Walking and biking are often the quickest, easiest, and healthiest ways to get around town and campus. Marked bike lanes and shared bike/motor vehicle lanes are marked on many area roads. Bike owners are required to register their bikes with Cornell (free online registration form ). Cornell has a system of marked bike lanes (white bike and rider symbol) and shared paths (yellow bike and rider symbol). Cycling on all walkways with no symbol is prohibited by municipal law and university regulations. Dismount zones are marked in heavily trafficked pedestrian areas (red circle and slash over bike and rider). Commuter bike paths also connect the campus to certain eastern residential areas. Bikers are required by law to use headlights at night. Owning a Car in Ithaca Fortunately, Ithaca and Cornell have good public transit, and the most important locations are within walking and biking distance of those who live near campus. If you do bring an automobile, it must be registered and insured, either in New York or in your home state.

and lakes, organic farms and wineries, a thriving music and arts community, and an invigorating climate year-round. Located at the southern tip of Cayuga Lake, the longest of the 11 Finger Lakes, Ithaca is consistently rated among the most livable cities in the United States. With more restaurants per capita then New York City, Ithaca has a bustling social scene with dozens of bars and restaurants, as well as music venues, theaters, and a farmers’ market that’s been named one of the best in the country by Zagat. Downtown Ithaca’s newly renovated Commons is an open-air pedestrian mall that’s at the center of the town’s dining, shopping, and entertainment scene. Events like the Downtown Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and the Great Downtown Ithaca Chili Cook-Off are held at the Commons throughout the year. Ithaca even has its own winery, Six Mile Creek Vineyard, which is one of 16 wineries, one cidery, one meadery, and four distilleries located along Cayuga Lake. The lake and the surrounding gorges offer great spots for outdoor activities like kayaking, hiking, jogging, swimming, or simply taking in the beautiful scenery, which includes more than 100 waterfalls. Learn more at Visit Ithaca . Climate Like most of the Northeastern United States, Ithaca has an invigorating four-season climate. Summers can be warm, and Ithacans often spend time outdoors hiking, sailing, kayaking, biking, and swimming in the many local parks. In the fall and spring, the weather can be brisk with frequent rain. Dressing in layers is preferred. Winter can be cold with a fair amount of snow. Ithacans enjoy skiing, skating, and sledding. A warm coat and snow boots are a necessity in the winter. Tip: Buy winter clothing in Ithaca. Stores in warmer climates often don’t have the right kind of clothing for our winters.

Reapplying How do I accept an offer of admission? Admission letters are sent directly from your graduate field and include important information about funding and resources at Cornell. To accept Cornell’s offer of admission, please log into your ApplyWeb account , and select your Cornell application for graduate admission. Click the button labeled “Complete your Decision Form” for instructions on how to accept or decline Cornell’s offer. Of course, you must be formally offered admission before you can accept or decline an offer. How long do I have to accept an offer of admission? Your admission letter will indicate when a response is due. Cornell abides by the Council of Graduate Schools’ “Resolution Regarding Graduate Scholars, Fellows, Trainees, and Assistants,” extracted below. Early notification is always appreciated and helps us plan for the upcoming year. Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15; earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. May I defer my offer of admission? You may be able to defer entrance to your program for one or two semesters under some special circumstances. To inquire about a deferral, please contact your graduate field directly. I was not offered admission and want to reapply next year. How do I reapply? If you are refused admission or declined a previous offer, you may reapply in the future using the standard online application. You should plan to submit new supporting materials to be considered for admission. Why should you consider Cornell?

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Apply Admissions Costs for International Students Admissions Costs for International Students Below is a comprehensive list of admissions-related costs international students can expect to pay if they are admitted to Cornell for their graduate studies. Application Fee A non-refundable application fee of $105 is required at the time you submit your online application. This is the same fee paid by U.S. applicants and covers the cost of processing your application for admission. Financial hardship-based fee waivers are available to eligible international applicants and may be requested directly through the application. Required Tests International applicants must meet our English language proficiency requirement and may be required to submit IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT scores. Verified Transcript Delivery Before the end of your first semester at Cornell, you are required to submit an official, final transcript of your undergraduate degree, with the degree marked as conferred or awarded, to the Graduate School Admissions Office. If you earned your undergraduate degree at an institution outside of the U.S., you must provide the transcript, a certified copy of your diploma and/or degree certificate, and a certified translation of all documents if they are not already in English. Electronic submission is required and we strongly recommend using CollegeNET’s CertiFile service (see below) or a WES ICAP . If you are having financial or logistical difficulties meeting this requirement, please use our online request form to contact us regarding your options. What is CertiFile? CertiFile is a credential verification and delivery service offered by ApplyWeb (CollegeNET) in partnership with Educational Perspectives and Digitary . The CertiFile service provides Cornell with verified official transcripts and other required documents and prevents the submission of fraudulent or unsuitable credentials. The documents are delivered directly to our office, you will be notified immediately when they arrive, and there is no expiration date for us to retrieve them. Additionally, your verified credentials will be stored in your Digitary wallet so you can access and share them with employers, recruiters, or other schools whenever you need to. Using CertiFile fully satisfies the Graduate School Admissions Office’s transcript requirements. You can find more information about CertiFile on our Transcript Requirements page . How Much Does it Cost? Students with international credentials (or a combination of U.S. and international credentials) will pay $205 USD to have their credentials verified, evaluated, and delivered electronically to Cornell. Students with U.S. (domestic) credentials will pay $50 USD to have their credentials verified and delivered electronically to Cornell. Apply for Your Visa Request Visa Documents After you accept your offer of admission, you will receive an email asking you to complete the online Admission Supplement for International Students . This supplemental ApplyWeb form collects the information we need to finalize your admission as an international student. If you plan to attend Cornell on a student visa, you must complete and submit this supplemental form before we can issue the Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 or DS-2019) for your visa application. You will be asked to pay a one-time, non-refundable Visa Document Processing Fee of $8 at the time you submit the form. (You will not be charged a fee if you do not need Cornell to issue F-1 or J-1 visa documents.) Pay the SEVIS Fee For information about who does or does not need to pay the fee, as well as the current fee amount, visit the U.S. government’s I-901 SEVIS Fee Frequently Asked Questions page. Complete a Visa Application The International Services office, within the Office of Global Learning, has a helpful webpage with information, links, and resources . Current visa application processing fees can be found on the U.S. Department of State’s website . Immunizations and Travel Costs Cornell Health has a page describing Health Requirements for New Students (both domestic and international). Why should you consider Cornell?

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Apply Important Application Policies Important Application Policies Deadlines Application deadlines vary by field. Please review field listings for the most current dates. Applying to Multiple Fields You may submit one application for a given term; multiple applications will not be processed. If you are not offered admission to your first choice program or have changed your mind about which program you want to apply to, you may contact one additional graduate field and ask to have your application reviewed. If the new field’s deadline has not passed and that field is willing to review your application, they should contact the Graduate School Admissions Office to initiate the transfer. Applications cannot be transferred between the Graduate School Admissions Office and other Cornell admissions offices including Cornell SC Johnson MBA Admissions, Cornell Tech Admissions, Cornell Law School Admissions, College of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) Admissions, Weill Cornell Admissions, Undergraduate Admissions, or the School of Continuing Education. These programs use different admissions systems run by different offices and review applications on different timelines. An application can be made to major fields only. Please review the field of study listing to verify that you are applying to a major field. Credentialing Services Cornell University expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents, credentialing services, or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services violates university policy, and may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the university. Online Courses if Outside of the U.S. Cornell is committed to compliance with all export control regulations, including U.S. sanctions. Any individual located in the following regions must receive written approval from Cornell’s Export Control and Compliance Officer prior to enrolling in an online course: Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Russia, Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk. Unsolicited Application Materials Publications, award certificates, resumes, theses, and similar materials should not be sent unless prior approval has been given by the field of study to which you are applying.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Prepare English Language Proficiency Requirement English Language Proficiency Requirement What You Need to Know How to Meet the Requirement Accepted Exams Test Score Guidelines How to Send Your Scores to Cornell Exemptions to the Requirements Graduate Field Requirements What You Need to Know To be successful in Cornell’s rigorous graduate and professional degree programs, students must be highly proficient or fluent in English. Students in doctoral degrees or research master’s degree programs (MA, MS, MFA) who are appointed as teaching assistants (TAs) must demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency. Students who have not met the higher threshold will be supported through Cornell’s International Teaching Assistant Program (ITAP) in the Center for Teaching Innovation. Applicants can demonstrate English Language proficiency using IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT scores or can provide proof of an exemption. Some graduate fields and programs have additional language requirements. They may require higher IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT scores or may request an interview before offering admission. How to Meet the Requirement All applicants must provide proof of English language proficiency.  There are 3 ways this may be done: Submit Scores – Provide official IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT test scores that meet the Graduate School’s minimums. Request a Standing Exemption in your application for admission – On the first page of the application form, you will attest that you meet one of the standing exemptions outlined below. Provide documentation if required. Request a Special Exemption – In exceptional cases, applicants may ask for a special exemption. Guidelines and the request process are outlined below. Accepted Exams IELTS Academic TOEFL iBT Both IELTS and TOEFL provide at-home testing solutions in most countries. Applicants are expected to take an in-person test whenever possible. However, if a safe in-person option is not available for you, you may take an online or at-home version instead. We do not accept any other English Language Proficiency exams (e.g. Pearson, Duolingo DET, etc.). Test Score Guidelines Research Degree Applicants (Ph.D., D.M.A., M.A., M.S., M.F.A.) Research degree applicants must demonstrate language proficiency at a level that will allow them to be successful in their graduate studies and as teaching assistants (TA). Admitted applicants from Score Tier A are automatically approved to serve as a TA, while applicants in Score Tier B should consult with their department to arrange for an English Language Assessment with Cornell’s International TA Program to determine whether additional language support in an ITAP course is required. English Language Test Score Guidelines Score Tiers IELTS Academic TOEFL iBT Score Tier A – Admissible with no additional language assessment needed to be a TA An overall band score of 7.0 or higher with A speaking section score of 8.0 Speaking: 27 or above Reading: 20 or above Listening: 15 or above Writing: 20 or above Score Tier B – Admissible with an English Language Assessment and support plan required before being appointed as a TA An overall band score of 7.0 or higher Speaking: 22 - 26 Reading: 20 or above Listening: 15 or above Writing: 20 or above Professional Master’s Degree Applicants (M.Arch., M.Eng., M.F.S., M.H.A., M.I.L.R., M.L.A., M.M.H., M.P.A., M.P.H., M.P.S., M.R.P., M.S.L.S., M.S.B.A.) IELTS Academic: An overall band score of at least 7.0 TOEFL iBT Speaking: 22 or above Reading: 20 or above Listening: 15 or above Writing: 20 or above How to Send Your Scores to Cornell IELTS Academic When you register for the exam, you may select up to 5 institutions to which you would like to have your scores sent. Cornell University has multiple IELTS accounts so please be sure to select Cornell University Graduate Admissions when registering for your IELTS test date. You may also ask your test center to send additional score reports to institutions not originally listed on your test registration form. Scores must be sent electronically (e-delivery) to the Cornell University Graduate Admissions, Caldwell Hall e-download account. E-delivery may also be referred to as an e-TRF by your test center. Paper TRFs (Test Report Form) are not accepted. Your IELTS Academic scores must be valid as of your program’s application deadline (scores are valid for 2 years after your test date). TOEFL iBT Have scores delivered electronically to Cornell University Graduate School, Institution code 2098. Department codes are not needed;  if ETS requires you to select a department code, you may choose code 99 “undecided.” Your TOEFL scores must be valid as of your program’s application deadline (scores are valid for 2 years after your test date). If you have taken the TOEFL iBT more than once within the last 2 years, have ETS send us your most recent score report. ETS will automatically include your MyBest scores along with the traditional scores from your selected test date. If your most recent scores do not meet the Graduate School’s minimum sub-score requirements, but your MyBest scores do, let the Graduate School and your proposed field of study know that you would like us to consider your MyBest scores. Please note: while the Graduate School accepts MyBest scores, individual graduate fields may not accept them. Standing Exemptions For admissions purposes, Cornell University Graduate School does not require IELTS or TOEFL scores from applicants who meet one of the following standing exemptions. However, applicants admitted to research degrees may still need to complete the English Language Assessment before being a TA. If you meet the criteria for one of the following standing exemptions, you will indicate this in your application for admission. There is no need to contact the Graduate Admissions Office in advance. Speak English as a first language and are a citizen or permanent resident of a country where English is an official language . Research degree applicants who meet this exemption are automatically approved to serve as a TA without an individual English Language Assessment. At the time of enrollment at Cornell, will have earned a bachelor’s degree from an accredited U.S. college or university located in the U.S. (Please note that you must have been physically present in the U.S. for the majority of your enrollment.) Research degree applicants who meet this exemption will need to complete the English Language Assessment and may be offered an individual support plan. At the time of enrollment at Cornell, will have earned the international equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree from a college or university located in a country where English is an official language , and where English is the language of instruction. The medium of instruction must be indicated on the transcript or easily verified on the institution’s website. (Please note that you must have been physically present in the exempt country for the majority of your enrollment.) Research degree applicants who meet this exemption will need to complete the English Language Assessment and may be offered an individual support plan. At the time of enrollment at Cornell, will have studied and/or worked full-time for at least 2 consecutive years* within the last 10 years in a country where English is an official and widely spoken language . This experience must be noted on a transcript and/or described on a resume or CV. We will accept a combination of study and work—e.g., an applicant who completed a 1-year master’s degree in the U.S. followed by 1 year of OPT. If you are or were a student, the full-time study must have been for at least 2 consecutive academic years (potentially slightly less than 24 months) AND English must have been the language of instruction for your studies. (Please note that you must have been physically present in the exempt country for the majority of your enrollment.) Research degree applicants who meet this exemption will need to complete the English Language Assessment and may be offered an individual support plan. Special Exemptions Applicants who speak English as a first language, but do not otherwise qualify for a standing exemption, may be considered for a special exemption under the following circumstances: Speak English as a first or native language, but citizenship does not meet the Standing Exemption criteria. Full-time study or work in a primary English country was for less than 2 years, was not consecutive, or occurred more than 10 years ago. Contact the Graduate Admissions Office if you think you qualify for a special exemption. Note: Research degree applicants with special exemptions admitted to research degrees may still need to complete the English Language Assessment prior to being a TA. Graduate Field Requirements Questions about your English language proficiency? Contact the graduate field to which you are applying. Administrators in your proposed field will guide you through the application process and will communicate with other offices at Cornell as needed to gather additional information.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Prepare Transcript Requirements Transcript Requirements Requirements for All Applicants Additional Requirements for Applicants with International Credentials Requirements for Admitted Students (only applicable AFTER you are admitted) All Applicants All applicants must have received—or be on track to receive before matriculation as a graduate student—a baccalaureate degree from a college or university of recognized standing. For students with international credentials, an equivalent international degree is required. Transcripts are required for every college or university you have attended. If transfer credits are noted on your undergraduate transcript, you should list the transfer school on your application but there is no need to upload a separate transcript. Please inform your prospective graduate field if your name on any of your credentials will be different from the one noted on your application. The online application requires you to upload an unofficial copy of each official transcript. To prepare your transcripts, follow the steps below: Do not upload transcripts that include a U.S. Social Security Number (SSN). Redact, cross out, or cover your SSN, if applicable, before scanning the document. The online application will not accept or properly display encrypted or password-protected documents. Official electronic transcripts (e-transcripts) must be printed first, then scanned and uploaded. Scan or save each transcript (and the English translation, if applicable) as a PDF, TIFF, JPEG, or GIF file. Combine multiple pages from the same transcript into one file; the file size for each upload cannot exceed 10MB. Ensure each scanned or saved image is clear and easy to read before submitting your application. Admitted students are required to submit official electronic transcripts (e-transcripts) directly to the Graduate School Admissions Office after accepting the offer of admission. Please see below for additional details. Applicants with International Credentials — Additional Requirements In addition to transcripts, applicants with international credentials must also provide a certified copy of the diploma and/or degree certificate for any conferred degree. All academic records must be official documents issued by the college or university and provided in the original language. A certified or notarized English translation must accompany the academic records if the original language is not English. A complete set of academic records should include the name of the degree program in which you were enrolled, your dates of attendance, a list of courses taken each year, grades received in each course, and the date your degree was conferred (if applicable). Combine multiple pages from the same set of academic records into one file; the file size for each upload cannot exceed 10MB. Admitted students are required to submit official electronic transcripts (e-transcripts) directly to the Graduate School Admissions Office after accepting the offer of admission. Please see below for additional details. Admitted Students This section is only applicable to admitted students who have accepted an offer of admission from Cornell. You must submit an official electronic transcript of your undergraduate degree, with the degree marked as conferred or awarded, to the Graduate School Admissions Office. Submit your documents as soon as possible to avoid processing delays. Documents must be received before October 1 for summer and fall admits, or before March 1 for spring admits. If you earned your undergraduate degree from Cornell University, you do not need to submit an official transcript. The Graduate School Admissions Office requires its own official electronic copy of your documents. Any transcripts or other academic records that you submitted with your application, or sent directly to your admitting program, will not fulfill the final transcript requirement. If you earned your undergraduate degree at an institution outside the U.S., you must provide the transcript, a certified copy of your diploma and/or degree certificate, and a certified translation of all documents if they are not already in English. All documents must be delivered electronically. Any documents sent to the Graduate School Admissions Office will become the property of the university and physical copies will not be retained. Electronic submission is required Transcripts and other required academic records must be delivered to Cornell electronically either by your institution OR by a credential verification service. We do not accept transcripts directly from students. Preferred providers include: CertiFile through ApplyWeb ( recommended , see below) Parchment National Student Clearinghouse SpanTran World Education Services (WES) (Course-by-Course ICAP only) Any NACES member credential evaluation service We also accept transcripts that have been certified and uploaded directly to your application by IIE, or Amideast or were submitted through SOPHAS, VMCAS, or LSAC. Important Notes: We have download accounts with CertiFile, Parchment, SpanTran, and WES. If you are using another service, or if documents are being electronically delivered by your institution, please have transcripts or retrieval instructions delivered to gradtranscripts@cornell.edu . E-transcripts with a retrieval deadline or expiration date should not be submitted to the Graduate School Admissions Office between March 1-June 1. Due to the volume of transcripts we receive and process, we are unable to send a confirmation receipt when we receive your transcript. We will only notify you directly if we are missing any documents. If you are having financial or logistical difficulties meeting the final transcript requirement, please use our online request form to contact us regarding your options. CertiFile What is CertiFile? Is it required? The CertiFile service provides Cornell with verified official transcripts and other required documents and prevents the submission of fraudulent or unsuitable credentials. The documents are delivered directly to our office, you will be notified immediately when they arrive, and there is no expiration date for us to retrieve them. Additionally, your verified credentials will be stored in your Digitary wallet so you can access and share them with employers, recruiters, or other schools whenever you need to. Using CertiFile fully satisfies the Graduate School Admissions Office’s transcript requirements. How much does it cost?

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Prepare Personal Statement Personal Statement Overview There are two types of statements included in the Graduate School’s online application, (1) the Academic Statement of Purpose and (2) the Personal Statement, both of which are required for all graduate degree programs. What Should the Personal Statement Include? Your Personal Statement should provide the admissions committee with a sense of you as a whole person, and you should use it to describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree. Additionally, it should provide insights into your potential to contribute to Cornell University’s core value to provide a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where scholars representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, abilities, and experiences can learn and work productively and positively together. Within your Personal Statement, you may also share details on lessons learned from any of your lived experiences including but not limited to being a first-generation college student or graduate (no parent/guardian completed a baccalaureate degree) racial, ethnic, and/or cultural background(s) managing a disability or chronic health condition experiencing housing, food, economic, and/or other forms of significant insecurity being a solo parent gender identity and/or sexual orientation having served in the military holding DACA, refugee, TPS, or asylee status Your Personal Statement provides you with an opportunity to share experiences that provide insights on how your personal, academic, and/or professional experiences demonstrate your ability to be both persistent and resilient, especially when navigating challenging circumstances. It also gives you an opportunity to provide examples of how you engage with others and have facilitated and/or participated in productive collaborative endeavors. Additionally, it is a place, where if necessary, you can (and should) address any blemishes, gaps, or weaknesses in your academic record. In these situations, you will want to be honest, but brief. It is best to turn negatives into positives by focusing on how you overcame obstacles, remained persistent in the pursuit of your goals, and showed resilience. Share what you learned from the particular experience, and how it led you to become a better researcher/scholar/person, etc. Content in the Personal Statement should complement rather than duplicate the content contained within the Academic Statement of Purpose, which should focus explicitly on your academic interests, previous research and/or relevant professional experience, and intended area of academic focus during your graduate studies. Why should you consider Cornell? Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

Veterans Women’s Communities Student Life Programs Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series Perspectives: The Complete Graduate Student Becoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Prepare Academic Statement of Purpose Academic Statement of Purpose What is it? Each applicant must submit an academic statement of purpose (ASOP). The ASOP is one of your primary opportunities to help the admissions committee understand your academic objectives and determine if you are a good match for the program you are applying to. The goal of this document is to impress upon the admissions committee that you have solid background and experience in your area of interest and that you have the potential to be successful in graduate study. Why is it important? The ASOP is one of the most important pieces of your graduate school application because it: Gives the reviewers an understanding of your academic background and interests. Allows you to illustrate in your own words what sets you apart from other applicants. Helps them determine if you are a good match for the program to which you are applying. Shows your communication style and ability. Information to include Introduce yourself and your academic interests Provide simple background information on your area of interest and how it became of particular interest to you. Here you can also share with them how and why you decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field. Describe your academic background, preparation, and training Discuss the skills you have learned from academic, lab, or research experiences (e.g., undergraduate coursework, research opportunities, scholarly writings, jobs in the field, presentations, etc.). Whenever possible, give specific examples and illustrate the points you are making, don’t just simply tell them. Talk about the research you conducted – project title or focus, research mentor, your specific role, what you learned, and the outcome. If there were challenges, don’t be afraid to mention what you learned from them. This shows persistence and resilience in the face of adversity– these are also things they are looking for! List important papers or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your academic degree requirements. Share relevant work or internship experience as related to the field you are applying to. Show them you are making an informed decision Indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in the discipline and are aware of research trends. Show them that you have thoroughly researched the program, its faculty, and research focus areas and why you are applying to this program specifically. This will help you write a more informed essay that is relatable to the faculty who will be reviewing your application. Describe why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you. If there are specific faculty you are interested in working with, check the program’s ASOP instructions and determine how best to mention this in your essay. Some programs require you to name a professor(s) with whom you would like to work. Are there any aspects of the program that are of particular interest to you (immersion program, opportunities for collaboration with others outside of the institution, research centers associated with the program, etc.)? Include information that is important to you outside of the program – supportive environment for first-year students, access to amazing literary resources, opportunities to participate in professional/career development programming, etc. Professional goals – you may wish to outline what you plan to do after you complete the program as a way of underscoring the importance of your choice to pursue graduate study. Share any extracurricular opportunities you have had that show leadership, ability to work with a diverse group of people, teaching skills, etc. Research degree applicants should identify specific faculty members whose research interests align with your own interests. Important things to remember Details Pay attention and follow instructions very carefully – every program is different and some have specific items/topics they want you to address. Unless otherwise noted, this is an academically focused essay, not necessarily a personal essay. You will likely add some personal details here and there, but be sure to keep the focus on your academic background and future potential. Proofread and pay close attention to details – they really matter! Have others from a variety of perspectives read your essay before you submit it – they should be looking at it in terms of content, style, and grammar. Remember, those outside of your field can provide you with valuable perspective and feedback. Keep in mind that you can continue editing your ASOP after you have submitted it to programs with earlier deadlines. Length, format, and tone Unless otherwise noted, one to two pages in a standard font and size is typical Include your full name and proposed program of study at the top of each page – if faculty are not reading an electronic version of your essay, pages can become separated. Write with confidence and in an active voice – doing this makes your sentences clear and less wordy/complicated. Language should be positive and focused. Since faculty are the ones reviewing your application, it is fine to use discipline-specific terminology, tone, and style in your ASOP. Final checklist Have you… Described your academic background in enough detail to show your experience and preparedness in the field? Shown that you are a good fit for the program you are applying to? Defined why you want a graduate degree in this field? Demonstrated that you are self-motivated, persistent, competent, and have the skills necessary to be successful in graduate school? Followed the ASOP instructions as defined by the program you are applying to? Polished, proofread, and had others review your ASOP? Why should you consider Cornell?

application. Students must submit the names and contact information for their references directly on the application. These faculty receive an email with a link to an online form to complete the reference. Referees can upload or type directly into the text box provided. Number of Recommendations Most fields require two or three letters of recommendation. Please check field admissions requirements for your proposed field. Recommenders Ph.D., M.A., and M.S. applicants: Letters must be submitted by faculty members from your current or prior academic institution who are acquainted with your academic work. If you haven’t been a student for some time, check with your prospective field to see whether recommendations from someone familiar with your professional performance might be acceptable instead. Applicants for professional master’s degrees: Letters may be submitted by faculty members or those familiar with your professional performance. Contact your field for specific guidance. Your Rights The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 allows you to review letters of recommendation submitted on your behalf after you enroll at Cornell University. You can waive your right to inspect your recommendations by checking “waive access” below each recommender’s address and before you submit the request. Waiving your right lets your recommenders know that you will not view their letters and lets the review committee know that your recommenders have provided their candid and truthful support.

Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores. Several fields require or accept the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) instead of GRE scores. All applicants must meet our English language proficiency requirement and may be required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores. Applicants are expected to take an in-person test whenever possible. The Graduate School remains committed to supporting avenues of access to graduate education. Therefore, if an in-person option is not available to you, you may take and submit scores from a home-based test. Please note, however, that in our experience, home-based test scores are more likely to be canceled than in-person test scores. Consequently, if your scores are canceled, you will need to retake the test. GRE requirements GRE requirements vary by field. Please check the application requirements for your proposed field for details on which tests are required. Institution Code: All official test scores should be reported directly to Cornell University’s institution code 2098 . Department codes are not needed for matching scores to applications. If ETS requires you to select a department code, you may choose “0000 undecided.” Score expiration: GRE test scores are valid for five years from the test date. GRE contact information: Educational Testing Service (ETS), Graduate Record Examinations GMAT requirements GMAT requirements vary by field. Please check the application requirements for your proposed field for details on which tests are required. The fields of hotel administration, real estate, management, industrial and labor relations, and the Sloan program in the field of public policy accept either the GRE or the GMAT.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Admissions Degrees & Fields Understanding the Field Structure Understanding the Field Structure At Cornell, graduate study is organized using a field structure. Fields are composed of faculty members from a number of departments who come together around a shared intellectual interest and may draw from different campuses or colleges. Graduate students are admitted to fields of study. Within each field, they select major and minor subjects, which are research interests or concentrations. Fields span departments and even disciplines. It’s possible for a student in the field of economics to include faculty on his or her special committee from industrial and labor relations, civil and environmental engineering, and sociology, along with the more traditional economics and management. For example, the graduate field of economics includes faculty from: public policy (School of Public Policy) applied economics and management (College of Agriculture & Life Sciences) industrial and labor relations (School of Industrial and Labor Relations) management (Johnson Graduate School of Management) civil and environmental engineering (College of Engineering) sociology (College of Arts & Sciences) economics (College of Arts & Sciences) Download the complete Graduate School Fields, Concentrations, and Subjects (PDF). The content of this PDF is available as accessible web content on our Field of Study search. Some professional degrees are administered directly by the fields. For example, the master of architecture is administered by the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning . Why should you consider Cornell? Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ leadership.

The Cornell University Graduate and Professional Student Assembly serves as an official voice for the around 6,000 graduate and professional students at Cornell. In addition to representing the students in matters of university governance, the GPSA has the responsibility for setting and administering the student activity fee for graduate and professional students. The GPSA can serve as a valuable component of graduate or professional education for those who hope to be affiliated with a university in the future. Since the GPSA regularly meets with the president and provost and sends representatives to the University Assembly, the undergraduate Student Assembly, and the Faculty Senate, involvement in the GPSA can provide an introduction (or an advanced course!) to the mechanics of shared governance in a university setting. The GPSA: Represents graduate and professional student concerns to the university administration; Allocates funds to graduate and professional student groups and sets the student activity fee; Advocates for graduate and professional students on issues, including student resources, health care, insurance, transportation, and housing; and Provides support for graduate and professional student programming. To learn more about what the GPSA does, see the Graduate and Professional Community Initiative (GPCI), a strategic plan created by the GPSA to identify and address issues related to graduate and professional student life.

(the Barn), an old carriage house turned student center, is located in the heart of campus and surrounded by lawns and gardens. A central place for eating and relaxing, the Barn hosts more than 500 events per year including trivia night, study/writing breaks, cultural celebrations, and the ever popular T.G.I.F. (Tell Grads It’s Friday). Connect with the Barn on Facebook and Instagram ( @brbcornell ) to stay up to date on Barn events and community-related news. History The Big Red Barn was built in the 1870s as the carriage house for the home of Cornell’s first president, Andrew Dickson White. The Barn, one of the oldest structures on campus, was converted to a social center by Cornell alumni in the 1950s and underwent a complete renovation in 1991. Antiques and farm implements recollect the building’s past, while new additions remain faithful to its rustic atmosphere. Setting The spacious main portion of the building includes a stunning, but cozy, mezzanine. Tables and chairs cluster around a large grass pellet stove creating a warm setting for events. Upstairs mezzanine has lounge furniture for small group gatherings and leisurely study. The sunlit “greenhouse” has additional seating and access to the outdoor patio. It can be closed off for special functions. In warm weather, a brick patio and outdoor picnic tables surrounded by gardens are available. The first floor of the facility is accessible by ramp. Location The Big Red Barn is located behind the A.D. White House and next to the Space Sciences building.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Career and Professional Development Three Minute Thesis Three Minute Thesis Three Minute Thesis (3MT®) is a competition for doctoral students to develop and showcase their research communication skills. 3MT Competition Could you present your 80,000 word thesis or dissertation in three minutes? Do you want the excitement of competing with other graduate students for a total of $2,500 in prizes and the opportunity to participate in the Northeastern (U.S. and Canadian) round or even to showcase your research at the annual Council of Graduate Schools meeting? 3MT is an annual competition sponsored by the Cornell Graduate School. 3MT challenges research-degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. All enrolled doctoral students at the research stage (with at least some results to share) are eligible. In 2024, the Graduate School 3MT is also open to research master’s students. The next competition will take place in Spring 2025. Learn more about the 2024 Graduate School 3MT competition. Email grad3mt@cornell.edu with any questions. All newly created videos on this website are accessible. Closed captions are available for the video on this page, and selecting the option to watch in YouTube will provide a transcript for the video. For an accommodation for this archival video, please contact gradschoolnews@cornell.edu . The first 3MT was held at The University of Queensland (UQ) in 2008 with 160 graduate students competing. Enthusiasm for the 3MT concept grew, and its adoption by numerous universities led to the development of an international competition in 2010. Today students from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region take part in their own regional and national events. Cornell Graduate School hosted its ninth 3MT competition final round event on Wednesday, March 20, 2024. Video submissions for the preliminary round was due on March 1, 2024, and was reviewed by a panel of volunteer judges using a common scoring rubric to select the finalists. At the final round event, held in person on the Ithaca campus, a panel of judges scored presentations and selected the top two finalists. Additionally, audience members were able to vote for their favorite presenter for the People’s Choice Award. 3MT Resources Watch videos of finalists from Cornell’s 3MT contests .

The program is ideal for self-motivated students who have expository skills, enjoy the research environment, and like working with undergraduates in introductory courses. Students in the program serve as teaching assistants and receive full tuition plus a stipend. Summary of Degree Requirements At least thirty-four credit hours of work is required. Six to twelve credit hours must be associated with thesis research (CS 7999). The remainder of the credit-hour requirement is fulfilled by taking between six and eight graduate-level courses. At least four of these courses must be CS courses at the 5000-level (or higher) and at least one of these must be at the 6000-level. An outside minor is required and that typically involves two or three graduate-level courses. A written thesis and oral presentation are also required. Financial Support Students who are admitted into the program serve as full time teaching assistants (TA’s) during each of the four semesters. This involves a fifteen-hour commitment to TA duties each week. In exchange, the student receives full tuition, a stipend to cover basic living expenses, and health insurance. Summer instructorships, TA-ships, and research assistantships are available but are not guaranteed. Serving as a TA is an integral part of the program. To remain in good standing in the program, students have to be among the top TAs in their assigned courses. TA performance is evaluated at the end of each semester.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Diversity & Inclusion Bouchet Honor Society Bouchet Honor Society Yale University and Howard University established the Edward A. Bouchet Graduate Honor Society in 2005. Named for the first African American doctoral recipient in the United States (Ph.D. from Yale University in 1876), the Bouchet Society recognizes outstanding scholarly achievement and promotes diversity and excellence in doctoral education and the professoriate. Outside of the society’s founding universities, Yale and Howard, Cornell was among the earliest universities to establish a Chapter of the Bouchet Society with its first members inducted in 2006. The Bouchet Society seeks to develop a network of preeminent scholars who exemplify academic and personal excellence, foster environments of support and serve as examples of CLASS: Character, Leadership, Advocacy, Scholarship, and Service. In the spirit of Bouchet’s commitment to these pursuits both within and without the academic realm, inductees into the honor society exhibit these qualities and demonstrate a commitment to advancing diversity, inclusion, access, and equity in the academy, especially by those from backgrounds historically underrepresented in higher education. Prospective Cornell Bouchet inductees must be an advanced doctoral candidate (priority consideration provided to those closest to completion), or a postdoc, faculty member, and/or academic affairs administrator with a Ph.D. Though priority consideration is provided to advanced doctoral candidates, the Cornell Bouchet Chapter also seeks to expand through the inclusion of a limited number of postdocs, faculty, and/or academic affairs administrators with a Ph.D. All prospective Cornell Bouchet inductees must be interested in or already on a faculty or academic career pathway and exemplify the following: record of academic and personal excellence foster environments of belonging and support serve as examples of character, leadership, advocacy, scholarship, and service within higher education commitment to advancing diversity, equity, access, and inclusion in higher education support access by and advancement of scholars from backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in the academy Bouchet Society Selection Timeline Early December– Solicitation for applications from advanced doctoral candidates, postdocs, faculty, and administrators who embody the characteristics of Dr. Bouchet as expressed through the five thrusts of the society: Character, Leadership, Advocacy, Scholarship, and Service . Early January– Completed applications and two letters of recommendation due on January 11, 2024 . Late January – Selection of new scholars announced. Late March/Early April – Annual Yale Bouchet Conference on Diversity and Graduate Education. Mid April – Induction of new scholars at Cornell. All scholars also participate in ongoing professional development opportunities through the Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement, Office of Postdoctoral Studies, and our partners.

Policy 6.4 provides definitions and explains the procedures employed for investigating and adjudicating allegations of sexual misconduct.

Complete this form to report hazing activity . Confidential channels for reporting hazing are available on Cornell’s hazing prevention website. Reporting is Confidential and Open to All Anyone who directly witnesses or experiences bias, sexual misconduct, or hazing activity (or finds evidence of or hears about such activity) on the Cornell campus or in an area that impacts the Cornell community should intervene in the moment as appropriate (e.g., contact Campus Police at 911, if a crime is in progress, or interrupt the behavior in as much as the observer feels skilled and safe). A report of the incident should be made as soon as possible. Resources to Support Those Receiving Threatening Communication or Harassment Guidance for deans, directors and chairs whose community members received threatening communications or harassment Guidance for faculty and staff who received threatening communications or harassment (transferable information and actions relevant for graduate students and postdocs) Guidance for library community when receiving professional harassment Guidance for those who may be concerned about the potential for or who are actively experiencing doxing . Ask for Help if You Need It The Mental Health at Cornell website will help you locate offices, services, and organizations in every corner of this campus to offer you assistance, support, connection, intervention, reporting, and advocacy. For 24/7 confidential consultation with a health care provider or counselor, students may call Cornell Health at 607-255-5155; faculty and staff may call the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program at 607-255-2673. Not Sure Where to Start? If you are a student, review the Student Bias and Assessment Process and associated FAQs to determine appropriate next steps. If you are a postdoc, faculty, or staff member, review the Bias Tracking Process for Faculty and Staff and associated FAQs to determine appropriate next steps. If you would like to speak with someone within the Graduate School about the various options that are available for reporting, please contact the Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement at 607-255-5417 or grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu .

Institutional Equity & Title IX – Responsibility to Report The Office of Postdoctoral Studies Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement The Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement (OISE) supports professional development programming and the advancement of the representation, inclusion, and success of graduate students from historically underrepresented and marginalized populations. This includes supporting faculty engagement in discussions and workshops on holistic admissions practices, diversity recruitment practices, establishing more inclusive research and learning environments, and developing greater understanding of the experiences and identities represented in the graduate population. Staff are also available for individual consultations. To learn more, visit the Diversity & Inclusion page . Workshops/Panels on Advancing Diversity & Inclusion in Graduate Education Exploring Diversity Strategies for Graduate Recruitment & Selection OISE provides consultations, and hosts invited speakers and facilitated panel discussions that focus on diversity recruitment strategies, equity-based holistic review practices in graduate admissions, and being aware of unconscious biases in the review of applications. For more information on diversity recruitment and holistic review resources, contact Sara Xayarath Hernández at grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu and Anitra Douglas McCarthy at amd78@cornell.edu . Equity-Based Holistic Review Workshops & Resources for Graduate Admissions EQUITABLE PRACTICES FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION The recent SCOTUS decisions on SFFA v. Harvard/UNC have broad implications for admissions across all degree programs within and beyond Cornell. As part of our response, the Graduate School offers directors of graduate studies, graduate admissions chairs, and graduate fields assistants the opportunity to engage in workshops focused on maximizing equity and minimizing risk in graduate admissions through mission and values-driven strategies and tools. Since 2018, the Graduate School has been engaged in systemic change efforts to advance equity-based holistic review practices within graduate admissions, which have led to productive outcomes for many graduate fields. Moving forward, our efforts to maximize equity in graduate admissions must be combined with processes that will also minimize legal risk for the institution and those engaged in selection. These workshops allow us to provide an in-depth review of the Graduate School Admissions Rubric template, which all graduate fields are required to use, and how fields may build upon it to meet graduate field-specific needs to inform admissions decisions. During these sessions, we also review other aspects of holistic review practices and share recruitment, communication, and selection strategies considerate of our post-SCOTUS conditions. “Equity in Science” Book Talk with Author and Professor Julie Posselt The Graduate School Offices of Inclusion & Student Engagement and Future Faculty and Academic Careers held a discussion with Julie R. Posselt , associate professor of higher education at the University of Southern California, on her book, Equity in Science: Representation, Culture and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education . Equity in Science: Representation, Culture, and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education “STEM disciplines are believed to be founded on the idea of meritocracy; recognition earned by the value of the data, which is objective. Such disciplinary cultures resist concerns about implicit or structural biases, and yet, year after year, scientists observe persistent gender and racial inequalities in their labs, departments, and programs. In ‘Equity in Science,’ Julie Posselt makes the case that understanding how field-specific cultures develop is a crucial step for bringing about real change. She does this by examining existing equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts across astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, and psychology. These ethnographic case studies reveal the subtle ways that exclusion and power operate in scientific organizations and, sometimes, within change efforts themselves. Posselt argues that accelerating the movement for inclusion in science requires more effective collaboration across boundaries that typically separate people and scholars—across the social and natural sciences, across the faculty-student-administrator roles, and across race, gender, and other social identities. Ultimately this book is a call for academia to place equal value on expertise, and on those who do the work of cultural translation. Posselt closes with targeted recommendations for individuals, departments, and disciplinary societies for creating systemic, sustainable change.” Cornell community members can access a recording of the “Equity in Science” book talk. Cornell community members can access a free copy of the e-book.

Bolstering this framework are resources and tools intended to be adapted and adopted to meet the contextual needs of mentors and mentees. FAIM is a collaboration of the Cornell Graduate School and Provost Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and the TRUST Alliance, which includes collaborators at Cornell, Montana State, and Purdue Universities. The Graduate School provides workshops, individual faculty consultations, and hosts invited speakers and facilitated panel discussions that focus on advancing inclusive mentoring practices and cultures within graduate education and academia. For more information on inclusive mentoring resources visit the FAIM Resource Center website or contact Associate Deans Sara Xayarath Hernández at grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu and Colleen McLinn at cmm252@cornell.edu . My Voice, My Story: Understanding the Untold Lived Experiences of Graduate & Professional Students My Voice, My Story sessions pair video monologues constructed from real experiences of graduate students with facilitated discussions. The primary objectives of these sessions are to utilize the power of narratives to achieve greater understanding of the lived of experiences of graduate and professional students, and to develop and share strategies on how to create more inclusive and supportive research and learning environments. (Offered in partnership with Future Faculty and Academic Careers.) My Voice, My Story sessions are available for faculty and staff and graduate student and postdoc audiences. To request a My Voice, My Story session, contact either Sara Xayarath Hernández at grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu or Colleen McLinn at futurefaculty@cornell.edu . Equity-Minded Mentorship – Why and How Identity Matters Speaker: Dr. Kimberly Griffin , Dean of the College of Education and Professor of Higher Education, University of Maryland While we know mentoring relationships are powerful interventions and a key strategy for promoting equity in the academy, we also know that these relationships often fall short of fulfilling their potential, particularly for early career colleagues with marginalized and minoritized identities. We will talk about what gets in our way of leveraging the power of mentorship to close equity gaps in the academy, and I will offer a framework for thinking about identity in the context of our relationships. We will also talk about promising practices and strategies that can enhance our ability to form mentoring relationships grounded in equity, affirmation, and care. Cornell community members can access a recording of this talk. Culturally Attuned Mentoring Paradigms – Relationships in Community Context Speaker: Dr. Sweeney Windchief (Fort Peck Assiniboine Tribe), Associate Professor of Adult and Higher Education at Montana State University How do mentors learn to mentor? Professional mentoring in higher education typically mirrors higher education in the contemporary American context, meaning that we tend to mentor the way we were mentored. This presentation builds upon the implementation of a program designed to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of faculty who mentor American Indian and Alaska Native graduate students in the STEM fields and is recalibrated for current faculty in other fields as well as those considering academia as a career. The goal of this session is for participants to consider how they can become active in co-constructing their own, identity informed, professional mentor/mentee platform. We also will discuss the concept of self-authorship in order to activate one’s own agency in developing a “constellation of mentors”. Different Institutional types and the specific disciplines in which we work have their own unique cultures, geographies, infrastructure, and resources that need to be considered. Cornell community members can access a recording of this talk . Faculty Roundtable Discussion Series on Graduate Student Mentoring The Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and the Graduate School Offices of Inclusion and Student Engagement , and Future Faculty and Academic Careers collaboratively host faculty roundtable discussions on topics related to graduate student mentoring practices. Topics for these discussions include defining and managing expectations, recognizing and managing power dynamics, productively managing conflict, matching work style preferences, and understanding motivation.

IDP Resources and Guides Community Agreements Community agreements are ‘ground rules’ that we establish early on to set expectations for how we want to communicate with each other. These agreements help set both practical norms and broader intentions of how we want to approach the conversation. ( This guide is for the broader Cornell community.) Listening & Learning with “I” Statements This guide is an accompaniment to our podcast, “I” Statements , where people with different identities come together to share their own beliefs, experiences, and perspectives, demonstrating both the power and the possibility inherent in communicating across difference. This guide is for people who would like to incorporate the podcast into their work with students and/or colleagues. (This guide is for educators more broadly.) Political Conversations This guide was prepared in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Although it refers specifically to this election, we believe the content here is applicable to many conversations people may wish to engage in surrounding politics. (This guide is for the broader Cornell community.) Using LARA LARA stands for listen, affirm, respond, and add information. The overarching aim of this tool is to encourage communication across difference (whether of identities, perspectives, or experiences). As a communication tool, LARA can be useful in building connection and trust with others, creating space for the exploration of multiple – even conflicting – perspectives, and bringing emotions, assumptions, and social identities into the conversation. The aim of LARA is to help steer a conversation towards mutual understanding of each other’s identities, lived experiences, and positions. (This guide is for the broader Cornell community.)

Guidance for Faculty and Staff Supporting Student Mental Health At Cornell, we all have a role to play in building a caring, inclusive community of students, faculty, and staff that takes seriously its responsibility to look out for one another. As a caring community, we value and prioritize one another’s mental health and well-being. As educators, mentors, and role models, faculty and staff have a profound impact on student well-being. Research has demonstrated that students’ academic experiences and relationships with faculty and staff have a considerable impact on their mental health and – in turn – students’ mental health has a significant impact on their academic performance. The Guidance for Faculty and Staff Supporting Student Mental Health resource page provides critical guidance for supporting students and provides details on resources available to support faculty and staff mental health and well-being. For questions and consultation, contact cornellhealth@cornell.edu . Intervene In the Intervene workshop, students view a brief video demonstrating ways in which student bystanders can successfully intervene in problematic situations. Seven different situations are addressed, including: sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence (emotional abuse), an alcohol emergency, emotional distress, hazing, and racial bias. Following the video, there is an opportunity for students to engage in a facilitated conversation to reflect upon the attitudes and behaviors that influence the process of intervening as an individual or with assistance. To schedule a session, please contact Laura Santacrose at LBS65@cornell.edu . Sexual Violence Awareness & Response Interactive discussions are tailored for groups requesting programs on sexual violence, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, healthy and unhealthy relationships, etc. Participants are given tools and information to help them understand definitions and concepts, available resources, how to be an active bystander, and how to respond to a friend, colleague, or student who has shared an experience of abuse or violence. To schedule a session, please contact Laura Weiss at lbw26@cornell.edu . Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX – Responsibility to Report As part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion, Cornell makes a concerted effort to ensure that our community can identify potential acts of sexual and related misconduct and knows who to contact and consult with if they learn about or experience sexual or related misconduct. Our aim is to make sure campus remains a safe and respectful academic and workplace environment focused on education. The staff of the Office of the Title IX Coordinator , together with our community partners, is available to provide in-person trainings to staff or faculty. If your department or unit is interested in a training, please contact titleix@cornell.edu . Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Training HR 200 “Respect@Cornell” “Addressing Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment” is required of all new employees at Cornell, replacing our previous program, “Building a Culture of Respect at Cornell.” This program, with an introduction from Cornell University President Martha Pollack, provides information on Cornell employee rights, responsibilities, and resources with respect to sexual and related misconduct and sexual harassment. It addresses how to respond should faculty or staff learn a member of our community has experienced any type of sexual violence or stalking and also lets faculty and staff know how to file a complaint. Federal law requires all faculty and staff to receive information about sexual assault/violence, domestic violence, dating violence (also known as intimate partner violence), and stalking prevention and response. The Title IX Office hopes and expects all current faculty and staff take this online course as part of their ongoing education and training mandates. HR 201 “Maintaining a Harassment-Free Workplace” HR 201 is a brief review of Cornell’s policy prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace, including video examples of how to address and counsel employees subjected to workplace harassment and resources available to all Cornell employees on these topics. “Duty to Consult” Training There is a community responsibility for creating a safer, more caring campus culture in which bias, harassment, and violence have no place—and every member of our community is free to flourish. One of the many ways in which Cornell lives up to this commitment is through the “Duty to Consult” with the Title IX Coordinator, a responsibility set forth in Policy 6.4 and long incumbent upon all staff and faculty members (with the important exception of confidential resources), when they become aware of an alleged incident of sexual and related misconduct under this policy, such as dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, that involves a student as either the complainant or respondent. This brief online training reviews the “Duty to Consult,” the importance of maintaining a student’s privacy, available confidential resources, and what does and does not happen when a member of the staff or faculty consults with the Title IX Coordinator, as well as providing information and resources for handling difficult conversations with students who choose to share experiences of sexual and related misconduct with you. Sexual Harassment and Assault – Response and Education (SHARE) SHARE offers resources and education related to sexual harassment and assault. Visit the SHARE website for more information. Office of Postdoctoral Studies The Office of Postdoctoral Studies monitors the status and needs of the postdoctoral campus community and serves as an advocate for postdoctoral issues to the vice provost for research and Cornell’s administration.

Veterans Women’s Communities Student Life Programs Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series Perspectives: The Complete Graduate Student Becoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Guidelines for Graduate Field Academic Handbooks Guidelines for Graduate Field Academic Handbooks Executive Summary Graduate fields develop and disseminate academic handbooks to support their graduate students’ academic progress and to harmonize students’ and faculty expectations by providing clarity on core requirements. Online handbooks are effective recruiting tools, as they provide prospective students with information about the program’s degree requirements, funding, and resources available to support students once admitted. The information below is designed to help fields develop a new – or update an existing – graduate field academic handbook, especially for doctoral students. These suggestions can be adapted as needed for research master’s degree students and professional degree students. Accessibility Per Cornell’s federal reporting requirements, field handbooks are required to be made available online. We encourage that fields present these as well-organized and accessible webpages or as an accessible, downloadable document. Purpose Field handbooks help the graduate community… Identify and understand essential information about the core requirements for student degree completion, differentiate among and understand requirements of the Graduate School, the field, and the special committee and chair, understand the normative timeline for completing field and Graduate School milestones, identify academic and professional development and other opportunities to support students at different stages during their degree program, and, importantly, clearly identify all the academic expectations that the field and faculty have for students so that there are no unknown or unwritten expectations. Additional Information Any additional information (such as lab manuals, student life information, building security and keys, facilities, field trips, graduate student organizations, journal clubs, photocopying, supplies, etc.) should be included elsewhere or at the bottom of the handbook via links. Additionally, please link to the Graduate School policies page rather than copying and pasting text from the Code of Legislation. Handbook Components Academic field handbooks are most easily understood when presented to students in chronological order so that students can understand the progression of their program and the required milestones to achieve each stage. Handbooks vary by field in content and scope; the checklist below includes components relevant to most degree programs. It includes suggested language and key questions that should be answered by each section. Fields that offer multiple degrees should ensure that the handbook makes clear distinctions between the different degree types (e.g., professional master’s, research master’s, doctoral) and that the handbook is divided appropriately based on this. Each degree should provide learning outcomes, field exam information, milestones, etc. Alternatively, a separate handbook can be provided for each degree. 1. Program Overview Include a general description of the graduate program, required registration, residency on campus, degrees, links to further information, and program recognitions or achievements, including program timeline and average time to degree. 2. Student Learning Outcomes List the intended program-level learning outcomes identified by the field faculty (these should match what is posted for the degree on the Graduate School Fields of Study page ). The outcomes should articulate what students are expected to know, and be able to do, upon completion of the degree. Describe any core competencies, language requirements, or learning goals. Describe how students’ achievement of the intended outcomes will be assessed (e.g., milestone exams; major papers, presentations, and projects; evaluation by the special committee). 3. Courses Include all required core courses and any required electives. Some fields have no required courses but, instead, allow the student’s special committee to advise the student on coursework. If that is the case, that should be explicitly described. Handbooks should describe the field’s policies on the following: Courses required by the department, if any. Are substitutions allowed? Is there a process for exempting students who have taken comparable courses at other institutions? What courses need to be taken and by when? What are the minimum number of credit hours required? Are required courses decided by the committee? Any process for how coursework requirements are decided should be clearly articulated. If the special committee advises on required courses, who helps the student choose their courses during their first three semesters prior to having a full committee (the DGS, a first-year advisor, etc.)? Articulate a process for how this works in your field. Minimum grades or GPA – Because Cornell’s Satisfactory Academic Progress policy stipulates that students in research degrees must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.25 to be in good academic standing or to be eligible for federal loans, it is required that a MINIMUM GPA of 2.25 be set. Incomplete (INC) grades – What are the expectations for students to complete INC grades? The Graduate School does not allow the grade to be changed after one year. Additionally, fields and instructors can set more strict deadlines if they wish. It’s often best to require INC grades to be resolved within a few weeks before students are busy with the following semester’s courses or research. Audits – Does the field have a policy on audited courses? What can be audited, taken as satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U), and what has to be taken for a grade? How are grades determined to be satisfactory? What happens to a student when they do not perform well in a class? Provide clarity as to what constitutes “good academic standing” and “satisfactory progress.” 4. Special Committees Per the Code of Legislation , the Graduate Faculty requires both research master’s and doctoral students to have identified (or been assigned) a special committee chair or a temporary advisor no later than three weeks after the first registration in the Graduate School (submitted to the Graduate School via Student Center). Additionally, per the Code, the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students to have a full special committee no later than the end of the second semester and no later than the end of the third semester for doctoral students. The Code includes specific exceptions for graduate students in economics and physics (Code VI.B.6.). In this section, describe the field’s requirements for special committees. Are the committee requirements explicit and clearly explained for your field? Do students already have an advisor identified at the time of admissions, are they assigned a temporary chair upon matriculation, or will they need to identify an advisor in their first weeks? Are rotations expected? If so, how are they structured? When should a student form a full committee? Do special committee members have to represent specific areas of expertise, required by the department or by the special committee? How many members are required by the field? (The Code of Legislation requires at least three.) What is the process if a student has difficulty identifying an advisor? Is funding linked to having an advisor by a certain deadline? Should the chair or a committee member resign, what is the replacement process for students? (This can be a link to relevant sources.) Specifically, what is the process for students to find a new chair/replace committee members, and what are the time constraints to still be in good standing? 5. Student Progress Review The Student Progress Review (SPR) supports regular communication including written feedback between students and their advisors, requiring research degree students and their special committee to have at least one formal conversation each year about academic progress, accomplishments, and plans. Students complete a form describing milestones completed, accomplishments, challenges, and plans. The special committee chair responds in writing and indicates whether the student’s progress is excellent, satisfactory, needs improvement, or is unsatisfactory . Describe when students are generally expected to complete the SPR each year. Are first-year students asked to fill out a SPR? Reinforce that the SPR should identify the student and advisor’s plans for upcoming academic deliverables, milestones, expectations, and deadlines. 6. Field Exams All required field exams, such as concentration, Q, A, and B exams, should be clearly articulated regarding timing, the exam requirements, deadlines for completing exams, exam outcomes, retakes, and consequences for each outcome, including pathways for dismissal from the program. Q Exams Some fields have a qualifying exam (Q exam), or concentration exams, required in the first or second year of doctoral study designed to determine students’ ability to pursue doctoral studies. Although requirements for Q exams vary widely by field, students who pass the Q exam continue in their doctoral studies (Code F.3.). The handbook should articulate how the exam is structured and what types of content may be included. Most importantly, there should be clear information conveyed on the possible outcomes of the exam. This section should answer: Who determines the outcome? Is a field-appointed member required? When and how will results be communicated? What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken? Are conditional passes possible? If a student may be dismissed for failing a Q exam are there any circumstances where the student may earn a master’s degree? What is the pathway for dismissal? A Exam To advance to doctoral candidacy, doctoral programs are required by the Graduate Faculty Code of Legislation to have an A exam, which can be completed after two semesters of registration and must be completed before the start of the seventh semester (Code F.1.c.). Some fields require completion sooner. This examination has varying formats (oral, written and oral, etc.) depending on whether its requirements are set by the field or by the special committee. The exam itself must be scheduled with the Graduate School, and announced to the field, no less than one week before the exam, though students should be aware they will need to schedule the date with their committee members far in advance of that deadline. The passing of this exam certifies that the student is eligible to present a dissertation to the Graduate Faculty. This section should answer: What are the requirements of the exam and format? Is there a field or public component? Is a field-appointed member required? Who determines the outcome? When and how will results be communicated? What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken? Are conditional passes possible, and if so, what are the explicit steps to reach a successful outcome? Articulate what happens if the outcome is not successful. If a student has failed the A exam, is there a pathway to earn a master’s degree (thesis or non-thesis) and what is the pathway for dismissal? These questions should also be considered in advance of the A exam if an unsuccessful outcome is anticipated. Consider offering links to examples of previous A exams. B Exam In addition, all doctoral students take a final examination (the B exam, which is the oral defense of the dissertation) upon completion of all requirements for the degree, no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration requirement (Code F.1.d.). This section should remind students that a complete draft of their thesis or dissertation must be submitted to all members of their special committee six weeks prior to the B exam, and a final draft is due to all members five business days before the exam. The B exam should not be scheduled until the dissertation is complete and in final format. Further, the B exam must be scheduled with the Graduate School, and announced to the field, no less than one week before the exam. Please remind students they will need to schedule the date with their committee members far in advance of that deadline. This section should further answer: Who determines the outcome? When and how will results be communicated, including any required revisions? What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken? Are conditional passes possible, and if so, what are the explicit steps to reach a successful outcome? Articulate what happens if the outcome is not successful. If a student has failed the B exam, is there a pathway to earn a master’s degree and what is the pathway for dismissal? Additionally, the final thesis or dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School no later than 60 days after the B exam. Enrollment in future terms is not permitted after a passed B exam. Master’s Students Per the Code of Legislation , the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students writing a thesis to take a final examination upon completion of all degree requirements, no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration requirement (Code F.1.a.). Per the Code of Legislation , the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students doing a research project report (in lieu of a thesis) to take a final examination at an appropriate time determined by the degree program. The exam may be oral or written to assess individual accomplishment of degree objectives (Code F.1.b.). The field should clarify if they allow the exam to be oral or written or if they have a more standardized approach (combination) For professional master’s students, please list any required final examinations in this section. 7. Dissertation and Thesis In general, a thesis or dissertation is required in the student’s major area of study (though a minor area can be allowed with approval) and under the supervision of the chair of their special committee. Doctoral students are required to submit a dissertation that is deemed acceptable in the scholarship and literary quality of their field. M.A. and M.S. students are required to submit a thesis or research project report that is appropriate to their program (exceptions to this include doctoral students receiving a non-thesis master’s.) Acceptance of the thesis or dissertation requires the approval of all the special committee members. This section should also address: Whether the special committee or field allows a paper option. If so, are there any requirements or expectations for publishing? Any additional requirements about the length or number of chapters, format, or content. 8. Setting Mutual Expectations for Mentoring Cornell supports the Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) framework for faculty/student mentoring that draws upon a strengths-based and identity-informed approach to support mutual growth, development, and success ( NASEM, 2019 ; Windchief, 2019 ). The FAIM philosophy, key principles, and core mutual expectation areas for inclusive mentorship provide a foundation for fulfilling mentoring relationships by: supporting mentors and mentees as they seek to develop an understanding of one another’s expectations, cultures, values, and sources of motivation; helping mentors and mentees develop a mentorship plan better aligned to a mentor’s and mentee’s strengths, needs, and goals; and providing resources and tools that can be adapted and adopted by mentors and mentees to be contextually relevant. Please direct your students to the FAIM website , for resources and tools to support their mentoring relationships. Remind students to work with the graduate field administrator (GFA), who can serve as a liaison between faculty and students, and the director of graduate studies (DGS) in their department who can both provide advice and help navigate mentoring challenges. 9. Required Training Some fields require training or courses related to safety and other topics in addition to university-required training on research with human subjects, animal care and use, etc. Describe these requirements relevant to the field’s students, including additional training required by the funding source and when and how students should complete the requirements. Per the Code of Legislation , the Graduate Faculty requires all research degree students, both master’s and doctoral, to complete responsible conduct of research (RCR) training . This includes training on authorship, peer review, and avoidance and consequences of research misconduct. This training is through the Cornell Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA) and must be completed before the end of the second semester (Code E.2.a.). 10. Field- or Program-Specific Requirements and Resources In this section, please include any additional field-specific academic requirements that are part of the academic program in your field. Examples of items that might be included: Teaching assignments Should provide clarity as to: Is teaching or teaching assistant (TA) service an academic requirement? What are the minimum number of semesters of teaching required? Is it stated in academic terms and included in the field’s published learning outcomes? Manuscript submissions and any requirements or expectations for publishing Field awards and recognition Colloquia presentations, conference posters, or papers External fellowship applications Individual Development Plans (IDPs) Minors/concentrations available to students in the field Summer progress Table or figure of program timeline and schedule Any additional milestones or requirements for professional degrees that aren’t captured in the Graduate School milestones section 11. Field-based Professional Development Some fields have a seminar, series, or workshop to help students with writing a fellowship application, developing and writing the dissertation proposal/prospectus, the job search, and other topics. If these are required or strongly suggested in your field, please describe them in sufficient detail here. If your field expects or requires students to write grant or fellowship applications as part of either the academic requirements or funding plan, describe the deadline, criteria, and sign-off process. 12. Funding Describe methods for funding in the field, including fellowships, teaching assistantships, training grants, etc.; stipend payment schedule; requirements for receiving and maintaining specific types of funding; summer funding; expectations for writing and submitting external fellowship applications; and funding for travel, research, and conferences. Indicate that doctoral students will remain funded through the completion of the degree as long as they remain in good academic standing. For Sage fields, when is the Sage dissertation-writing fellowship typically used? Describe summer funding plans. If students are expected to secure external support, describe how funding is provided if they are unsuccessful. Are there field or departmental fellowships available? If so, is there an application process? How are teaching assistant assignments typically made? If students typically conduct field research while in absentia, describe how required funding is provided during this time. If the field limits the number of funded in absentia semesters, provide clear guidance to allow students to plan accordingly. Note that unfunded in absentia for field research is not permitted. Sample Field Handbooks These Cornell graduate fields have graduate student handbooks that are useful as examples for their content, scope, and format. Biomedical engineering Near Eastern studies Plant biology Graduate School Contacts For assistance updating field handbooks or creating new content, please contact the Associate Dean for Academics Josephine Martell ( gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu or jem522@cornell.edu ).

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Advising Guide for Professional Students Advising Guide for Professional Students Success as a graduate student is a shared responsibility between students and faculty. Your responsibility to identify and choose an advisor is one of the most critical tasks you have early in your graduate school career. It’s an opportunity to meet and get to know faculty in your field, to assess your needs for support and supervision, and to collaboratively define your goals, values, and strategic plan for your academic and professional career. Advisors and Program Directors in Professional Degree Programs All professional degree students must have an advisor. In some fields, this person may be the program director, who is responsible for general oversight of the program, including admissions, curriculum development, degree requirements, and student progress toward degree completion. In other fields, students may have a faculty advisor who works closely with the program director. Professional degree programs are course-based. Satisfactory progress to the degree depends on completion of required and elective courses while maintaining at least the minimum grade point average (GPA) specified by the field. Professional degree program requirements are defined by faculty in each field. These requirements, as well as the length of time allowed to complete them, vary by field, so the advisor has an essential role in helping their students identify and meet all requirements for the degree. Difference between an Advisor and a Mentor Advising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, but understanding the distinctions is important as you choose an advisor. Advisor Responsibilities Guides you in meeting the requirements and expectations for your degree Helps you develop a plan for completing your program that includes specific milestones and deadlines for the following: Required coursework Exams required by the graduate field Fieldwork, internship, or other capstone experience Writes informed letters of recommendation for your job applications Mentor Responsibilities Provides support and guidance that extends beyond scope of advising Demystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate education Expands your professional network by introducing you to others Provides nominations for awards or other recognitions Brings job opportunities to your attention and writes letters of recommendation as you apply for jobs Advocates for you within the graduate program and profession May serve as a role model and source of inspiration May become a colleague and peer in your discipline and may continue serving a mentoring role Finding an Advisor When do I select my first advisor? At Cornell, the process for obtaining your first advisor varies by field. Your faculty advisor may be assigned prior to your arrival or you may select an advisor during your first semester. Either way, it’s important to start your graduate study with clear expectations and thoughtful communication about your plans for an effective advising relationship and success in graduate school. How do I find an advisor? Meet and get to know faculty in your courses and in graduate field seminars and other events. Talk to advanced students about their experiences and perceptions of the faculty in your programs and ask questions about possible advisors: How would you describe their approach to advising? What can you tell me about their work style? What can you tell me about their research interests? How good are their communication skills? How clear are their expectations for their graduate students? Do they use timeliness in reviewing their students’ writing and their approach to giving feedback? How available are they to meet with their graduate students? After you have gathered information, make an appointment to meet with a potential advisor. Possible Questions How often do you meet with your students? What are your expectations for students related to professional development and networking, such as attending conferences or making presentations? How soon should I identify a fieldwork or internship site or project for my capstone experience, if required? How do you describe the degree of guidance and supervision you provide? At what point do you expect your students to begin to work more independently? Do you have a statement of advising you can share that lists our respective responsibilities and clarifies mutual expectations? What’s your advice on how students can manage what they find to be the biggest challenges in their graduate program? Getting Other Mentoring Needs Met How do I find other mentor(s)? You may find one faculty member who can serve as both advisor and mentor, but that’s not always the case. Consider identifying and cultivating additional mentors if that is the case. No one mentor can meet all of your needs. Good mentors have many protégés and many other demands on their time, such as teaching, research, and university or professional service. They also may not have all the expertise you need, for example, if you decide to search for jobs in multiple employment sectors. Develop a broad network of mentors whose expertise varies and who provide different functions based on your changing needs as you progress from new student to independent scholar and researcher. Maximizing the Advising Relationship A successful relationship with your advisor depends on several different factors and varies with needs and working styles of the individuals. Some of these factors are under your control. But some are not. Suggestions for Building a Successful Advising Relationship Identify what you need from an advisor. Communicate clearly and frequently with your advisor to convey your questions, expectations, goals, challenges, and degree progress. Follow up verbal communication and meetings with an email detailing your understanding of what you both agreed to and next steps. Develop written academic and Individual Development Plans that include your career goals, your program’s degree requirements and milestones, funding and financial aid, and a timeline with your anticipated deadlines. Update your written academic plan each semester or whenever major changes or adjustments are needed. Consider including plans for professional development that support your skill-building objectives and career goals. Recognize that you and your advisor have distinct perspectives, backgrounds, and interests. Share yours. Listen to your advisor’s. There is mutual benefit to sharing and learning from this diversity. Work with your advisor to define a regular meeting schedule. Prepare and send written materials in advance of each meeting. These could include: your questions, academic and research plan and timeline, and drafts of current writing projects, such as fellowship applications, manuscripts, or thesis/dissertation chapters. Be prepared to negotiate, show flexibility, and compromise, as is important for any successful relationship. Be as candid as you are comfortable with about your challenges and concerns. Seek guidance about campus and other resources that can help you manage and address any obstacles. Reach out to others for advice. Anticipate challenges and obstacles in your graduate degree program and their impact on the advising relationship. Be proactive in finding resources and gathering information that can help you and your advisor arrive at solutions to any problems and optimize your time together. Making Use of Meetings First Meetings Your first meeting sets the tone for a productive, satisfying, and enduring relationship with your advisor. Your first meeting is an opportunity to discuss expectations and to review a working draft of your academic plan. Questions to ask about expectations What do your most successful students do to complete their degrees on time? How often do you want us to meet? May I send you questions via email, or do you prefer I just come to your office? Would you like weekly (biweekly? monthly?) updates on my research progress? Do you prefer reviewing the complete draft of a manuscript or may I send you sections for feedback? After each meeting, I’ll make a list of what we each agreed to do before our next meeting to help me keep moving forward with my research. Would you like a copy of that list, too, via email? Draft Academic Plan Prepare and bring a draft plan that outlines your “big picture” plans for your coursework, research, and writing, as well as an anticipated graduation date. (Or, email in advance with a message, such as, “I’m looking forward to meeting with you on [date] at [time], [location]. In advance, I’m sending a copy of my academic plan and proposed schedule for our discussion.”) Contents of the plan Include the requirements and deadlines of your degree program. (This is information you should be able to find online or in your program’s graduate student handbook.) Include a general timeline indicating when you plan to meet requirements for courses or seminars, any required papers (such as a second-year paper), exams required by the graduate field (such as the Q exam) or by the Graduate School (the A exam and the B exam for research degree students). If your graduate field has a specific set of required courses, indicate the semester you may complete each of them, and be open to suggestions from your advisor. If your field does not have required courses, have some idea about the courses you are interested in taking and solicit input and suggestions from your faculty advisor. Subsequent Meetings Use each subsequent meeting as an opportunity to update your written academic plan and stay on track to complete your required papers and exams, your research proposal or prospectus, and the chapters or articles that comprise your thesis or dissertation. In later meetings, you can elaborate on your general initial plan: Adding specific coursework or seminars Add professional development opportunities that interest you (workshops, dissertation writing boot camp, Summer Success Symposium, Colman Leadership Program, etc.) Include intentions to participate in external conferences and travel to research sites Identify a semester or summer when you would like to complete an internship. Your written plan is also important to document what your advisor has agreed to, especially when the deadline to submit a manuscript or your thesis is looming and you are awaiting feedback or approval from your advisor. Use a combination of oral and written communications to stay in touch with your advisor, establish common expectations, and mark your progress toward degree completion. Meeting Frequency The frequency of meetings between advisors and advisees varies by field and individual. Assess your own needs and understand your advisor’s expectations for frequency of communication (in person and via email). Does your advisor like to provide guidance each step of the way so that he or she is aware of the details of everything you are doing? Does your advisor want you to launch your work more independently and report back at pre-determined or regular intervals? What do you need to be productive? Are you ready to work more independently? Be proactive in seeking information. Explicitly ask how often your advisor usually meets with new students and how the advisor prefers to be updated on your progress in between meetings. Ask your peers how frequently they meet with their advisor and whether this has changed over time. There will be disciplinary differences in meeting frequency. In humanities and in some social sciences, where library, archive, and field research take students away from campus, maintaining regular communication is essential, including through scheduled meetings whether in-person or virtual. In life sciences and physical sciences and engineering, students often see their advisors daily in the lab or meet as a research group about externally funded projects; these regular check-ins and conversations may replace formal meetings. Make sure that you are also scheduling one-on-one times to talk about your broader goals and academic and career planning progress, however. Some of your decisions about meeting frequency will be informed by talking to others, but much of it you learn through experience working together with your advisor. Even this will change over time as you become a more independent researcher and scholar. Communicate with your advisor regularly about your changing needs and expectations at each stage of your graduate career. Resolving Conflict In any relationship, there can be conflict. And, in the advisor-advisee relationship, the power dynamic created by the supervision, evaluation, and, in some cases, funding role of your advisor can make conflicts with your advisor seem especially high. You have options, however, including: Reviewing the Cornell and Graduate School polices. They provide clear expectations, help you manage problems when they occur, and protect you from retribution when trying to address these problems. Examples of these policies include: Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty Campus Code of Conduct Policy on Academic Misconduct Research Misconduct Graduate School Grievance Policy Intellectual Property policies Talking with your advisor to clarify any miscommunication. Cornell University’s Office of the Ombudsman , one of the offices on campus that offers confidentiality, can also assist you by talking through the issue and helping you gather information you need before you speak directly with your advisor. Speaking with someone in the Graduate School, either the Associate Dean for Academics ( gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu or jem522@cornell.edu ) for academic issues, or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ) for other issues. These deans will listen, offer advice and support, and can also rehearse with you any conversation you might want to have with your advisor. They can also contact your advisor, if you want them to do so. Touching base with your program director – if this person is not also your advisor –to talk to about policies and possible solutions to the conflict. Soliciting peer advice. Discuss strategies for managing and resolving conflict with your advisor. “Do you have any suggestions for me?” “Have you ever had an issue like this…?” can be effective questions. Identifying a new advisor if the conflict can not be resolved. Your program director can help with this, and the Graduate School (as above) can help as well. Changing Advisors On occasion, students find that they need or want to change their advisor. An advisor can resign as the student’s special committee chair/faculty advisor. The Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty describes the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty in each of these situations. Typical reasons to seek a new advisor include: Research interests that veer from the faculty’s expertise or ability to fund a certain project Your advisor retires or resigns from the university or takes an extended leave of absence for personal or professional reasons Differences in goals, values, or an approach to work or communication style that can’t be resolved Serious issues, involving suspected inappropriate behavior, questionable research conduct, or alleged bias, discrimination, or harassment If you are considering changing advisors: Talk to your program director or someone in the Graduate School about the proposed change. Some issues, such as funding, require timely attention. Identify other faculty members who could serve as your advisor, then meet with one or more of them. The goal is to decide together if you are a good fit with their program. Tips: Discuss or rehearse this conversation with a trusted person, especially if there were issues with your last advisor. Be transparent about these issues and address them going forward with a new advisor. Often prospective advisors are more willing to take on a new graduate student who conveys genuine enthusiasm for their area of study rather than a student who seems to be looking for a way out of a current advising relationship that has gone sour. Consider how and when to inform your advisor if you plan to change advisors. Be professional and respectful. Thank your advisor for past support and guidance. Don’t damage, or further damage, the relationship. Faculty may have professional relationships with each other and in some cases personal relationships. Consider how such relationships may influence your choices in changing advisors and consider asking the following people to help you navigate complicated situations. Your program director, if appropriate Office of the University Ombudsman Graduate School’s Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ) Graduate School’s Associate Dean for Academics ( gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu ) Challenges and Potential Solutions All good relationships take work. To navigate an advising relationship successfully over time, you should familiarize yourself with some common challenges and possible actions to take. Challenge: Mismatch in communication needs or style One example of a communication challenge in an advising relationship is when you want input along the way during a writing project, but you have an advisor who prefers to wait to comment on a complete written draft. Some possible steps to address this might be to talk to peers about they have handled this in their relationship with their advisor or to explain to your advisor how his or her input at this earlier stage will help speed you along toward having a complete draft for review. It’s important in communicating with your advisor to show that you understand what alternative they are proposing and why (e.g., “I understand that …”). Challenge: Advisor unavailable or away Your advisor might be away from campus for a semester or more to conduct research or take a sabbatical leave. Or when a grant proposal deadline or report is looming, your advisor might be less available. Maybe you’ve emailed your advisor several times with no response. Planning and stating in advance what you need, such as feedback on a manuscript draft or signatures on a fellowship application, can help your advisor anticipate when you will have time-sensitive requests. Making plans in advance to communicate by email or video conference when either of you will be away from campus for a longer period of time is another useful strategy. Your director of graduate studies (DGS) and other faculty who serve as special committee members can also provide advice when your advisor is unavailable. Challenge: Misaligned expectations You are ready to submit a paper or project. Your advisor says it needs much more work. Or you begin your job search, applying for jobs in government or the non-profit sector, but your advisor insists that you should apply for industry jobs or graduate school instead. Discussing your needs and expectations early, and often, in the advising relationship is essential. Get comfortable, and skilled, advocating for yourself with your advisor. Use the annual Student Progress Review as an opportunity to communicate your professional interests and goals with your advisor. Use multiple mentors beyond your advisor to get advice and expertise on topics where you need a different perspective or support. Sometimes challenges can become opportunities for you to develop and refine new skills in communication, negotiation, self-advocacy, and management of conflict, time, and resources. For example, although you might feel abandoned if your advisor is unavailable for a time, even this potentially negative experience could become an opportunity to learn how to advocate for yourself and communicate about your needs and perceived difficulties in the relationship. Funding for Professional Master’s Students The funding available from Cornell, if any, will be described in your offer of admission letter. You can explore supplemental funding options on the Experience Cornell website . You should take stock of the total program cost and develop a realistic plan for funding your education in advance to minimize the risk of depleting funds midway through. If you do find yourself in a position where you can’t afford to continue it may be helpful to speak with your advisor about taking a leave while saving up or seeking external funding options or loans. In very rare cases, professional students may be given the opportunity to serve as a TA and receive both a stipend and tuition credit (but this is not common.) Of course, it’s always important to carefully consider the value of your education relative to your career plans. Avoid taking on debt that will be disproportionate to the salary projections in your chosen career field. Resources On Campus Graduate School deans and directors are available to answer academic and non-academic questions and provide referrals to useful resources. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) staff offer confidential, professional support for students seeking help with stress, anxiety, depression, grief, adjustment challenges, relationship difficulties, questions about identity, and managing existing mental health conditions. Let’s Talk Drop-in Consultations are informal, confidential walk-in consultations at various locations around campus.

graduate student is a shared responsibility between students and faculty. For research students, the relationship with your research advisor, also known as your special committee chair, is extremely important. Your responsibility to identify and choose an advisor is one of the most critical tasks you have early in your graduate school career. It’s an opportunity to meet and get to know faculty in your field, to assess your needs for support and supervision, and to collaboratively define your goals, values, and strategic plan for your academic and professional career. Graduate School Requirement At Cornell, the faculty advisor in research degree programs is referred to as the special committee chair. Doctoral students have a special committee of at least three Cornell faculty, which includes the special committee chair and two minor committee members. Master’s students have a special committee of at least two Cornell faculty, which includes the special committee chair and one minor member. For both doctoral and master’s degree students, the special committee chair must be a graduate faculty member in the student’s own field. Definition of an Advisor Advising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, but understanding the distinctions is important as you choose an advisor. Advisor Responsibilities Guides you in meeting the requirements and expectations for your degree Helps you develop a plan for completing your program that includes specific milestones and deadlines for the following: Required coursework Exams required by the graduate field or the Graduate School Research proposal/prospectus Research project Thesis or dissertation Writes informed letters of recommendation for your job applications May be a valued colleague or collaborator after you graduate Mentor Responsibilities Provides support and guidance that extends beyond scope of advising Demystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate education Expands your professional network by introducing you to others Provides nominations for awards or other recognitions Brings job opportunities to your attention and writes letters of recommendation as you apply for jobs Advocates for you within the graduate program and discipline May serve as a role model and source of inspiration May become a colleague and peer in your discipline and may continue serving a mentoring role Finding an Advisor When do I select my first advisor? At Cornell, the process for obtaining your first advisor varies by field. Your faculty advisor may be assigned prior to your arrival or you may begin your program with a faculty member you met during the application process. In some graduate fields, the faculty director of graduate studies (DGS) advises all incoming students. This provides you with time to get to know faculty in your field. By the end of the first semester or year (varying by field), it’s expected that you will have identified your own, long-term advisor. In fields where students apply to study with a specific faculty member (rather than do rotations and choose a lab or research group and advisor), you will have chosen an advisor prior to arriving on campus. You can begin initial conversations about expectations and the advising relationship with your new advisor prior to the start of your program via email. Start your graduate study and research with clear expectations and thoughtful communication about your plans for an effective advising relationship and success in graduate school. How do I find an advisor? Meet and get to know faculty in your courses and in graduate field seminars and other events. Talk to advanced students about their experiences and perceptions of the faculty in your programs and ask questions about possible advisors: How would you describe their approach to advising? What can you tell me about their work style? What can you tell me about their research interests? How good are their communication skills? How clear are their expectations for their graduate students? Do they use timeliness in reviewing their students’ writing and their approach to giving feedback? How available are they to meet with their graduate students? After you have gathered information, make an appointment to meet with a potential advisor. Possible Questions Is there a typical timeline you encourage your students to follow in completing their degree programs? How often do you meet with your students at different stages of their graduate program? (For example, during coursework, research, and writing stages) What are your expectations for students to make conference presentations and submit publications? What are your authorship policies? (This is especially relevant in fields where there is collaborative research and publishing involving the student and advisor or a group of students, postdocs, and faculty.) How soon should I identify my research project? How do you describe the degree of guidance and supervision you provide with regards to your students becoming more independent in their research and scholarship? If you are joining a lab or research group: What are the sources of funding for this research? Are there any new or pending research grants? How many of your students seek, and secure, external funding? What are your expectations for students to apply for external fellowships? Do you have a statement of advising you can share that lists our respective responsibilities and clarifies mutual expectations? What’s your advice on how students can manage what they find to be the biggest challenges in their graduate program? Add other questions to your list based on your own needs and specifics of your program, such as questions about specialized equipment, lab safety, travel to field sites, support and accommodations for special health needs, communication during a faculty member’s sabbatical, funding in fields where there are fewer fellowships and research grants, etc. Getting Other Mentoring Needs Met How do I find other mentor(s)? You may find one faculty member who can serve as both advisor and mentor, but that’s not always the case. Consider identifying and cultivating additional mentors if that is the case. Suggestions on where to look for a mentor: The minor members of your special committee A faculty member who is not on your committee, and perhaps not even in your graduate field Peers and postdoctoral fellows who have knowledge and experience in pertinent issues No one mentor can meet all your needs. Good mentors have many protégés and many other demands on their time, such as teaching, research, and university or professional service. They also may not have all the expertise you need, for example, if you decide to search for jobs in multiple employment sectors. Develop a broad network of mentors whose expertise varies and who provide different functions based on your changing needs as you progress from new student to independent scholar and researcher. NCFDD offers a webinar, “ Cultivating Your Network of Mentors, Sponsors, and Collaborators “, which students can view after activating a free NCFDD membership through Cornell. Maximizing the Advising Relationship A successful relationship with your advisor depends on several different factors and varies with needs and working styles of the individuals. Some of these factors are under your control. But some are not. Suggestions for Building a Successful Advising Relationship Identify what you need from an advisor. Communicate clearly and frequently with your advisor to convey your questions, expectations, goals, challenges, and degree progress. Follow up verbal communication and meetings with an email detailing your understanding of what you both agreed to and next steps. Develop written academic and Individual Development Plans that include your career goals, your program’s degree requirements and milestones, funding and financial aid, and a timeline with your anticipated deadlines. Update your written academic plan each semester or whenever major changes or adjustments are needed. Use your annual Student Progress Review , required by the Graduate School, effectively to record your progress, articulate your goals and plans to meet academic milestones, and seek feedback from your advisor. Consider including your plans to write competitive fellowship applications and co-authored grant proposals. Consider including plans for professional development that support your skill-building objectives and career goals. Recognize that you and your advisor have distinct perspectives, backgrounds, and interests. Share yours. Listen to your advisor’s. There is mutual benefit to sharing and learning from this diversity. Work with your advisor to define a regular meeting schedule. Prepare and send written materials in advance of each meeting. These could include: your questions, academic and research plan and timeline, and drafts of current writing projects, such as fellowship applications, manuscripts, or thesis/dissertation chapters. Be prepared to negotiate, show flexibility, and compromise, as is important for any successful relationship. Be as candid as you are comfortable with about your challenges and concerns. Seek guidance about campus and other resources that can help you manage and address any obstacles. Reach out to others for advice. Anticipate challenges and obstacles in your graduate degree program and their impact on the advising relationship. Be proactive in finding resources and gathering information that can help you and your advisor arrive at solutions to any problems and optimize your time together. Making Use of Meetings First Meetings Your first meeting sets the tone for a productive, satisfying, and enduring relationship with your advisor. Your first meeting is an opportunity to discuss expectations and to review a working draft of your academic plan. Questions to ask about expectations What do your most successful students do to complete their degree on time? How often do you want us to meet? May I send you questions via email, or do you prefer I just come to your office? Would you like weekly (biweekly? monthly?) updates on my research progress? Do you prefer reviewing the complete draft of a manuscript or may I send you sections for feedback? After each meeting, I’ll make a list of what we each agreed to do before our next meeting, to help me keep moving forward with my research. Would you like a copy of that list, too, via email? Draft Academic Plan Prepare and bring a draft plan that outlines your “big picture” plans for your coursework, research, and writing, as well as an anticipated graduation date. (Or, email in advance with a message, such as, “I’m looking forward to meeting with you on [date] at [time], [location]. In advance, I’m sending a copy of my academic plan and proposed schedule for our discussion.”) Contents of the plan Include the requirements and deadlines of your degree program. (This is information you should be able to find online or in your program’s graduate student handbook.) Include a general timeline indicating when you plan to meet requirements for courses or seminars, any required papers (such as a second-year paper), exams required by the graduate field (such as the Q exam) or by the Graduate School (the A exam and the B exam for research degree students). If your graduate field has a specific set of required courses, indicate the semester you may complete each of them, and be open to suggestions from your advisor. If your field does not have required courses, have some idea about the courses you are interested in taking and solicit input and suggestions from your faculty advisor. Subsequent Meetings Use each subsequent meeting as an opportunity to update your written academic plan and stay on track to complete your required papers and exams, your research proposal or prospectus, and the chapters or articles that comprise your thesis or dissertation. In later meetings, you can elaborate on your general initial plan: Adding specific coursework or seminars Add professional development opportunities that interest you (workshops, dissertation writing boot camp, Summer Success Symposium, Colman Leadership Program, etc.) Include intentions to participate in external conferences and travel to research sites Identify a semester or summer when you would like to complete an internship. Your written plan is also important to document what your advisor has agreed to, especially when the deadline to submit a manuscript or your thesis is looming and you are awaiting feedback or approval from your advisor. Use a combination of oral and written communications to stay in touch with your advisor, establish common expectations, and mark your progress toward degree completion. Meeting Frequency The frequency of meetings between advisors and advisees varies by field and individual. Assess your own needs and understand your advisor’s expectations for frequency of communication (in person and via email). Does your advisor like to provide guidance each step of the way so that he or she is aware of the details of everything you are doing? Does your advisor want you to launch your work more independently and report back at pre-determined or regular intervals? What do you need to be productive? Are you ready to work more independently? Be proactive in seeking information. Explicitly ask how often your advisor usually meets with new students and how the advisor prefers to be updated on your progress in between meetings. Ask your peers how frequently they meet with their advisor and whether this has changed over time. There will be disciplinary differences in meeting frequency. In humanities and in some social sciences, where library, archive, and field research take students away from campus, maintaining regular communication is essential, including through scheduled meetings, whether in-person or virtual. In life sciences and physical sciences and engineering, students often see their advisors daily in the lab or meet as a research group about externally funded projects; these regular check-ins and conversations may replace formal meetings. Make sure that you are also scheduling one-on-one times to talk about your broader goals and academic and career planning progress, however. Some of your decisions about meeting frequency will be informed by talking to others, but much of it you learn through experience working together with your advisor. Even this will change over time as you become a more independent researcher and scholar. Communicate with your advisor regularly about your changing needs and expectations at each stage of your graduate career. Resolving Conflict In any relationship, there can be conflict. And, in the advisor-advisee relationship, the power dynamic created by the supervision, evaluation and, in some cases, funding role of your advisor can make conflicts with your advisor seem especially high. You have options, however, including: Reviewing the Cornell and Graduate School polices. They provide clear expectations, help you manage problems when they occur, and protect you from retribution when trying to address these problems. Examples of these policies include: Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty Campus Code of Conduct Policy on Academic Misconduct Research Misconduct Graduate School Grievance Policy Intellectual Property policies Graduate Student Assistantships (Policy 1.3) Talking with your advisor to clarify any miscommunication. Cornell University’s Office of the Ombudsman , one of the offices on campus that offers confidentiality, can also assist you by talking through the issue and helping you gather information you need before you speak directly with your advisor. Speaking with someone in the Graduate School, either the Associate Dean for Academics ( gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu ) for academic issues, or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ) for other issues. These deans will listen, offer advice and support, and coach you through any conversation you might want to have with your advisor. Together, you can brainstorm possible solutions and evaluate alternative plans for resolution. Touching base with your director of graduate studies (DGS) – if this person is not also your advisor – to talk to about policies and possible solutions to the conflict. Soliciting peer advice. Discuss strategies for managing and resolving conflict with your advisor. “Do you have any suggestions for me?” “Have you ever had an issue like this…?” can be effective questions. Identifying a new advisor if the conflict can not be resolved. Your DGS can help with this, and the Graduate School (as above) can help as well. The National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity offers a webinar, “ How to Engage in Healthy Conflict “, which students can view after activating a free NCFDD membership through Cornell. Changing Advisors On occasion, students find that they need or want to change their advisor. An advisor can resign as the student’s special committee chair/faculty advisor. The Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty describes the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty in each of these situations. Typical reasons to seek a new advisor include: Research interests that veer from the faculty’s expertise or ability to fund a certain project Your advisor retires or resigns from the university or takes an extended leave of absence for personal or professional reasons Differences in goals, values, or an approach to work or communication style that can’t be resolved Serious issues, involving suspected inappropriate behavior, questionable research conduct, or alleged bias, discrimination, or harassment If you are considering changing advisors: Talk to a member of your committee, your director of graduate studies (DGS), or someone in the Graduate School about the proposed change. Some issues, such as funding, require timely attention. Identify other faculty members who could serve as your advisor, then meet with one or more of them. The goal is to decide together if you are a good fit with their program. Tips: Discuss or rehearse this conversation with a trusted person, especially if there were issues with your last advisor. Be transparent about these issues and address them going forward with a new advisor. Often prospective advisors are more willing to take on a new graduate student who conveys genuine enthusiasm for their area of study rather than a student who seems to be looking for a way out of a current advising relationship that has gone sour. Consider how and when to inform your advisor if you plan to change advisors. Be professional and respectful. Thank your advisor for past support and guidance. Don’t damage, or further damage, the relationship. Faculty may have professional relationships with each other and in some cases personal relationships. Consider how such relationships may influence your choices in changing advisors and consider asking the following people to help you navigate complicated situations. Your DGS, if appropriate Office of the University Ombudsman Graduate School’s Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ) Graduate School’s Associate Dean for Academics ( gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu ) Forms: Use Student Center if you are changing your advisor before your A exam (for Ph.D. students). Use the Post A Committee Change Petition form for changes after the A exam. More information is available on the Graduate School’s Policy pages . Challenges and Potential Solutions All good relationships take work. To navigate an advising relationship successfully over time, you should familiarize yourself with some common challenges and possible actions to take. Challenge: Mismatch in communication needs or style One example of a communication challenge in an advising relationship is when you want input along the way during a writing project, but you have an advisor who prefers to wait to comment on a complete written draft. Some possible steps to address this might be to talk to peers about they have handled this in their relationship with their advisor or to explain to your advisor how his or her input at this earlier stage will help speed you along toward having a complete draft for review. It’s important in communicating with your advisor to show that you understand what alternative they are proposing and why (e.g., “I understand that …”). Challenge: Advisor unavailable or away Your advisor might be away from campus for a semester or more to conduct research or take a sabbatical leave. Or when a grant proposal deadline or report is looming, your advisor might be less available. Maybe you’ve emailed your advisor several times with no response. Planning and stating in advance what you need, such as feedback on a manuscript draft or signatures on a fellowship application, can help your advisor anticipate when you will have time-sensitive requests. Making plans in advance to communicate by email or video conference when either of you will be away from campus for a longer period of time is another useful strategy. Your director of graduate studies (DGS) and other faculty who serve as special committee members can also provide advice when your advisor is unavailable. Challenge: Misaligned expectations You are ready to submit a manuscript for publication. Your advisor says it needs much more work. Or you begin your job search, applying to liberal arts colleges with very high reputations, or schools in your preferred geographic location, but your advisor insists that you should apply for positions at top research universities. Discussing your needs and expectations early, and often, in the advising relationship is essential. Get comfortable, and skilled, advocating for yourself with your advisor. Use the annual Student Progress Review as an opportunity to communicate your professional interests and goals with your advisor. Use multiple mentors beyond your advisor to get advice and expertise on topics where you need a different perspective or support. Sometimes challenges can become opportunities for you to develop and refine new skills in communication, negotiation, self-advocacy, and management of conflict, time, and resources. For example, although you might feel abandoned if your advisor is unavailable for a time, even this potentially negative experience could become an opportunity to learn how to advocate for yourself and communicate about your needs and perceived difficulties in the relationship. Advising Resources On Campus Graduate School deans and directors are available to answer academic and non-academic questions and provide referrals to useful resources. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) staff offer confidential, professional support for students seeking help with stress, anxiety, depression, grief, adjustment challenges, relationship difficulties, questions about identity, and managing existing mental health conditions. Let’s Talk Drop-in Consultations are informal, confidential walk-in consultations at various locations around campus.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Academic Progress Faculty Guides to Advising & Mentoring Research Degree Students Faculty Guides to Advising & Mentoring Research Degree Students Graduate students view effective advising, mentoring, and positive, productive relationships with faculty as important to their success in graduate school and on the job market. The importance of positive and productive faculty-graduate student relationships is supported by research literature on graduate student satisfaction, students’ publishing rates during graduate school, and degree completion support, as well as by the findings of Graduate School surveys of graduate students and alumni. Faculty Guide to Advising Research Degree Students Advising and Mentoring Advising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, and faculty may serve in both roles for a student. Advisor Responsibilities The faculty advisor is responsible for guiding students in meeting the requirements and expectations of the graduate field and the Graduate School for the degree. Help students develop a plan and timeline to meet expectations and milestones for each step of the degree program, including requirements of the special committee, the graduate field, and the Graduate School, within an appropriate timeframe for the following: Required coursework Exams required by the graduate field or the Graduate School Effective research proposals/prospectus Research projects Thesis or dissertation Along with the graduate student, completes the required annual Student Progress Review (SPR) on the timeline expected by the graduate field. Writes informed letters of recommendation for a student’s job or postdoc applications, often serving in this role for many years after a student graduates. Mentor Responsibilities A faculty advisor who also serves as a faculty mentor provides support and guidance that extends beyond the scope of advising and may include any of the following: Communicates with their mentee about the mutual expectations for their mentoring relationships Co-constructs a mutual expectations agreement plan with their mentee Demystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate education Supports their mentee in building out their professional and mentor network by purposefully introducing them to professional colleagues Suggests opportunities for career exploration or job applications Provides nominations for award recognitions and letters of recommendation for the job market Actively advocates for mentees within the graduate program and in the broader academic or professional community beyond Cornell May serve as a role model and source of inspiration May become a professional peer and potential collaborator, in the future Mentoring relationship may persist over time Some faculty may serve as both an advisor and mentor to particular students, or only an advisor or only a mentor to other students. Faculty can encourage graduate students who they advise and/or mentor to cultivate a network of multiple mentors with varied expertise who will provide different functions based on changing needs as graduate students progress through their programs from new students to independent scholars and researchers. Creating a Culture of Belonging and Respect Cornell students arrive here from across the world and represent a diversity of social identities, lived experiences, and academic interests. Advisors and mentors play a crucial role in helping students develop a sense of belonging and community within their degree programs, research groups, and the university more broadly. Advisors and mentors should not only be sensitive to, but also responsive to, the individual differences and experiences of graduate student advisees and mentees. Adopting culturally-aware advising and mentoring practices can help advisors and mentors become more sensitive and responsive to the individual differences and experiences of advisees and mentees. A Culturally Aware Advising and Mentoring Approach A culturally aware approach to advising and mentoring requires advisors and mentors to develop an understanding of the lived experiences and social identities of graduate student advisees and mentees. This approach requires advisors and mentors to identify and recognize their own culturally shaped beliefs, perceptions, and judgments and to be cognizant of the cultural differences and similarities between themselves and their advisees and mentees. It also requires advisors and mentors to gain both intrapersonal and interpersonal cultural awareness and skills to recognize and respond to cultural diversity related issues that may arise in their advising and mentoring relationships. Become aware of implicit biases and how to mitigate them Learn how to have meaningful conversations about identity and difference with graduate student advisees and mentees Become more familiar with the potential impact of social identity in challenging conversations, and to learn how to engage empathetically with conflicting perspectives Avoid making assumptions about the lived experiences and social identities of students by listening and learning from students about their individual experiences and needs This approach helps create an inclusive, supportive environment where graduate students have the opportunity to feel valued and respected for their individual experiences, differences, and contributions. Students feel a greater sense of belonging within their degree programs, while advisors and mentors better understand the unique backgrounds of their students, which can help inform their individualized advising and mentoring strategies. For more information, see Byars-Winston, Angela et al. “Pilot Study of an Intervention to Increase Cultural Awareness in Research Mentoring: Implications for Diversifying the Scientific Workforce.” Journal of clinical and translational science vol. 2,2 (2018): 86-94. doi:10.1017/cts.2018.25.

Advising New Students The transition to graduate school for new students, and the transition to Cornell for those who may have completed some or all of a graduate degree program elsewhere, can be both an exciting and challenging time. Location, climate, culture, requirements, and expectations may be new and difficult to navigate. Even the logistics and routines that become commonplace after a short time, such as those involving housing, transportation, weather, nutrition, and wellness, might be overwhelming during the first few weeks and months. Tips and Resources Effective advising and mentoring includes knowing about and referring students to the resources they need to help manage these challenges. Graduate student handbooks, available in most fields, describe the graduate field degree requirements, the field’s expectations related to successful study and research, and the resources available to students. Peer mentoring programs, available in some graduate fields, pair new students with current students to help acclimate them to graduate study at Cornell. Encourage new students to attend the Graduate Student Orientation . The Navigating Graduate School page on the Graduate School website lists resources to help admitted and arriving students. Encourage students to use the Graduate School and other campus resources throughout their time pursuing a Cornell degree. Advising International Students International students comprise nearly half of all Graduate School students. With varying levels of English language fluency and experience with the American system of higher education, international students may need additional resources or information to acclimate. Resources The Graduate School’s FAQ for International Students provides the following information: Required Admission Supplement for International Students Financial Certification Visas: Special Topics NetIDs CertiFile Summer Program for English and Culture (SPEAC) The English Language Support Office (ELSO) The Office of Global Learning Orientation for international graduate and professional students Visa counseling Tax and employment advice Other supports for international students The Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) International Teaching Assistant Language Assessment International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Summer Training Program International Teaching Assistant Program (ITAP) Advising First Generation and Students from Historically Underrepresented Backgrounds Students who identify with one or more identities historically underrepresented in graduate education – racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, disability, first generation college students, veterans – are more likely to find themselves as being the only or one of few from their social identity groups. Consequently, positive and productive advising and mentoring relationships are especially important to supporting their progression, academic and professional development, and success. About a third of doctoral recipients identify as first generation college students whose parents do not have a college degree. Though first generation students are represented across all demographic groups, they are more likely to identify with other backgrounds historically underrepresented in the academy. They are also more likely to be from lower to modest socioeconomic backgrounds, potentially making it difficult to cover costs associated with some social and professional activities such as research conferences. Tip: Making formal and informal professionalization and socialization activities more accessible to all advisees and mentees can help mitigate these challenges. First generation and other students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in graduate education that did not have access to certain mentoring experiences may lack insights on the sociocultural norms, systems, structures, and unwritten rules of academia, potentially negatively impacting their academic acculturation and successful progression through their graduate studies. This lack of critical knowledge, which can be learned, has the potential to negatively impact their academic acculturation and successful progression through their graduate studies. Tip: Demystifying the unwritten rules, language, and norms of graduate education especially within the context of a specific graduate field can help mitigate these challenges. Advisors and mentors play a critical role in helping students identify resources within and beyond their graduate programs to support their development of a sense of belonging and community at Cornell. Regardless of a student’s background, it is essential for advisors and mentors not to make assumptions or generalizations about students based on any aspect of their social identities or lived experiences. Tip: Expressing interest in students as whole individuals, listening to what they choose to share about their experiences, and asking about their specific interests and needs help advisors and mentors make informed suggestions on which opportunities and resources might best meet the academic and professional development needs of advisees and mentees. For more information, visit the Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) website or contact the Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement . Advising Students with Families About 30% of Cornell’s graduate and professional students have a spouse or partner; almost 10% have one or more children. Many also have responsibility, financial or otherwise, for other family members. These students manage their time, work, and finances with a focus on their family and may ask for advice or share their challenges with faculty who provide a more supportive climate. Tips and Resources Act as a role model for work-life balance. Communicate and support flexibility in your students’ schedules, particularly around personal and holiday time. Refer students to the Cornell resources that support students with families, such as student-parent dependent care grants , the Cornell Child Care Center , health insurance for dependents, medical care for children, and the lactation rooms. Become familiar with the Students with Families website, which includes policy updates, special events, and resources for students’ spouses/partners and children. Developing Effective Advising Relationships Effective (and efficient) advising relationships begin by discussing expectations early on. Transparency about expectations and timely communication are two essential factors associated with good advising and mentoring that graduate students often mention. Cornell graduate students also note the importance of faculty approachability, support, honest and regular feedback, and a recognition that both advisor and advisee and mentor and mentee can benefit from strong, positive relationships. Developing a shared understanding of expectations A shared understanding of mutual expectations within an advising or mentoring relationship begins at the first meeting and is continually refined over time. Covering topics, like the ones listed below, will allow both of you to discuss and align expectations. Ask students about the areas where they might need support: writing, teaching, research, professional networking, etc. Discuss goals, work style preferences, and communication style – and the degree to which these are in alignment (or the degree to which flexibility and adaptation will be needed). Suggest areas where the advisor can help based on strengths, skills, knowledge, and availability. Consider other faculty and administrators who can provide support or mentoring beyond the advisor’s own expertise and/or availability. Be aware of campus resources and refer students to those resources freely and without judgement. Talk about logistics including frequency of in-person meetings and progress updates by email. Begin to make plans and set deadlines for meeting degree requirements, such as Q and A exams. Discuss funding plans. Discuss needs and expectations for presenting and publishing research, especially in fields where collaborative research and co-authorship are common. Encourage students to look for information and advice from across campus. Encourage students to develop a network of mentors. Tips for Sensitive Conversations Often, students are not comfortable speaking with their advisor about weaknesses and challenges. Sometimes it helps to refer a student to the Graduate School or another campus office. Example: “Most students experience stress at some point in graduate school. They find that the deans in the Graduate School are helpful with talking about a range of difficulties, finding community, or resolving problems…even challenges with their advisor!” “I often suggest to students that they talk to someone at Cornell Health about…motivation, procrastination, anxiety about writing, feelings of isolation, etc.” Advising for Degree Progression and Completion Effective advisors help their students understand and meet degree and other expectations for successful completion of their program. Tips and Resources Make degree requirements readily available, preferably as part of the graduate field’s online graduate student handbook. Provide students with additional requirement details pertinent to their individual needs or plans. Provide students with the unwritten rules to academic success. The expected quality of work The importance of meeting deadlines Expectation for establishing professional and social networks in graduate school and in the discipline Encouragement for attending conferences and making presentations, presenting posters and papers, writing for publication, securing funding, preparing early for the job market, etc. Provide students with important information specific to your discipline, for example: the length of time it might take to get required approvals to conduct research projects (e.g., from animal care or human participant review boards) and how to continue productivity while waiting for approval, getting timely feedback from faculty on drafts of proposals or dissertation chapters, or how to strategically engage each member of a special committee for greater support and efficiency. Providing Feedback on Academic Performance Regular and candid communications about academic progress can help a student be more productive, efficient, and confident that they are moving in an advisor-approved and supported direction for degree completion. Tips Ask students to develop an academic and research plan that includes dates for accomplishing each requirement, including: Course requirements Special committee formation Fellowship applications and feedback Field and Graduate School exams Proposal or prospectus Research and publications Thesis or dissertation Consider asking students to use a planning tool like the Individual Development Plan (IDP) in which students outline their academic, research, and professional development plans. Revisit student plans, at least annually, as part of the required Student Progress Review . Review and assess progress Recognize accomplishments Identify obstacles Promptly discuss problems and help provide options for addressing them. Supporting Student Well-being Mental health and well-being are the foundation for academic and life success. Not all stress is problematic. Some stress can increase students’ functioning, and overcoming challenges is an important part of developing resilience; however, extreme psychological distress can undermine a student’s ability to persist and impact degree completion. Nationally, graduate students report higher levels of depression or anxiety compared to the general population. This is true for Cornell graduate students as well. According to the Cornell Doctoral Experience Surveys (2019 and 2021), over half of Cornell Ph.D. degree students have reported mental health concerns as being a major or minor obstacle to their academic success. Effective advisors actively create and promote a culture of well-being. Tips Expectations and feedback Provide clear expectations , timeline and assessment criteria. Motivate through positive rather than negative reinforcement. Belonging and social connectedness Get to know your students personally, professionally, and academically. Encourage your students to get to know each other. A sense of academic and social belonging improves self-efficacy, mental health, productivity, and satisfaction. Growth mindset and motivation Demonstrate and communicate a belief in a student’s ability to grow by acquiring new knowledge and skills. Provide honest feedback that encourages self-reflection and steady progress forward. Normalize failure and help-seeking behaviors as part of the process of learning. Meaning and purpose Encourage self-reflection practices that allow students to gain greater self-awareness. Share your own professional journey. Support student career exploration (within and beyond academia) and preparation. Stress management and self-care Validate the importance of rest and self-care in relation to academic performance, mental health, and well-being. Endorse the practice of taking meaningful breaks and actively managing stress. Addressing Concerns about Students At times you may have concerns about your students’ well-being and may be unsure what to do. Cornell has resources for you to engage with to support the student’s well-being. Concerns: Safety: Cornell University Police : 607-255-1111. Students in crises: Student Support and Advocacy Services in the office of the Dean of Students focus areas include campus-wide case management and crisis response services. Case management consists of building 1-on-1 helping relationships with students while coaching them toward resources, self-care, and self-advocacy. Students experiencing non-crisis physical, psychological, safety, and patterns of academic concern should be referred to this office via this form by selecting the Student of Concern in the Report Type drop-down menu. To reach the Administrator on-Call after-hours , call the Cornell University Dispatch at 607-255-1111 and request to be connected to the Administrator on-Call. Students in distress: Cornell Health Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) counselors are available to assist faculty and staff members regarding students in distress. Contact them at 607-255-5155. During business hours, press 1 for urgent concerns or 2 to be connected with a CAPS receptionist. When Cornell Health is closed, your call will be answered by the answering service, and an on-call health care provider will return your call within 30 minutes. Advice: The Graduate School Office of Graduate Student Life can help determine how best to support academic and student life concerns. We can help brainstorm strategies to support difficult situations, discuss next steps, connect with other campus resources, and make action plans. Your director of graduate studies is a great resource if you are concerned about the well-being of your student and is often aware of other resources or strategies to best support you and your student. Disabilities or accommodations: If your student is asking for academic flexibility because of a particular concern (i.e. medical, disability, or experience), refer the student to the Student Disability Services (SDS) Office. SDS will make sure that the institution has fulfilled all legal obligations and provides structure and a process to support both advisor and student in negotiating what is an appropriate accommodation. There may be times that your student will be best supported through other Cornell offices; please become familiar with other available resources . Guiding Students' Professional and Career Development Students engage in professional development opportunities and begin career exploration at varying times. Perceptions about the job market both within and beyond academia can create considerable concern and anxiety, while exploring and preparing for a variety of career options can foster confidence and competence. Tips Encourage students to utilize the services and engage in the events and programs provided by the Career & Professional Development team within the Graduate School. Provide encouragement and guidance as your students prepare to enter the job market. Refer students to resources available on campus, recognizing that advisors may not have direct experience with a specific type of job. Refer students to designated faculty or career professionals in your field. Encourage students to attend professional meetings of regional groups or organizations. Assist students with preparing application materials for appropriate funding opportunities. Resources Pathways to Success , the Graduate School’s professional development framework for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, is designed to support student success now and into their future careers.

See Free Memberships for Cornell Graduate Students and Postdocs . Special Challenges in Advising Special Challenge: Avoiding Email’s Pitfalls Emails often lack nuance, and messages can appear overly demanding or aggressive. Communicating in person is often the best way to foster a positive and effective relationship. If you need to communicate by email, consider the following tips: All emails, faculty and student, should be responded to in a timely manner and within two weeks. For emails requiring a more rapid response, indicate the date by which you need a response. If students do not respond, consider appropriate next steps to determine if the student is alright or if there are problems that require other resources. Consequences for non-responsive students should be discussed with the DGS and can include a notification that funding will be withdrawn or the advisor will resign. Special Challenge: Resolving Conflict Conflict can be present in any relationship. The power dynamic created by the advisor’s supervision, evaluation, and funding roles can make students hesitant to address differences in opinion or approaches. The stakes can feel too high and the outcome too fraught with fear of losing funding or an advisor. Tips and resources Review Cornell and Graduate School policies that can help prevent and manage problems. Examples of these policies include the following: Graduate Faculty’s Code of Legislation Student Code of Conduct Policy on Academic Misconduct Research Misconduct Graduate School Grievance Policy Intellectual Property Graduate Student Assistantships (Policy 1.3) Communicate regularly and work to clarify any miscommunication. Talk to the field director of graduate studies (DGS) who can suggest a resolution and also facilitate a conversation with both parties present. Consult the Office of the University Ombuds . These Graduate School deans can assist faculty and students, individually or together, in developing strategies to resolve conflict. They can also refer advisors and students to a trained conflict resolution consultant on campus. Contacts: Associate Dean for Academics, gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu Associate Dean for Inclusion and Student & Faculty Engagement, grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life, gradstudentlife@cornell.edu If the conflict can’t be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, the advisor may choose to resign, or the student may choose to get a new advisor. Students can consult with the Graduate School Associate Dean for Academics or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life about changing advisors. The Graduate School’s Code of Legislation provides detailed guidance on changes to special committee membership and committee member resignations. Challenge: Working with Students Who Want to Leave Graduate School On occasion a student with whom you are working will decide to leave Cornell for another graduate program or to leave graduate study altogether. These students may find it difficult to discuss their decision. They may believe that leaving a graduate program is a sign of failure or feel guilty that they are letting others, like their advisor, down. Tips Discuss sound reasons for leaving constructively, for example, a poor fit or timing issues. Consider other personal or professional reasons, remembering that students often return for graduate study at Cornell or elsewhere. Consider whether the student will benefit from your advice, especially if there are areas in which the student truly needs to improve to be successful in graduate school. In cases where the student’s academic progress has been inadequate or where there has been conflict or unresolvable mismatch in communication or work styles between student and advisor, refer the student to the DGS or to someone in the Graduate School for this conversation and feedback. The Graduate School can help develop a supportive exit plan to the degree that is possible. (In situations where the student is leaving related to academic or research misconduct or academic integrity violations, the Graduate School will have been involved from the outset; please contact the Associate Dean for Academics if you have questions.) Special Challenge: Conflicts of Interest Conflicts of interest can impact advising and result in inappropriate decisions affecting students. The focus should always be on what is in the student’s best interest. Examples Romantic, sexual, or personal relationships with the student Intellectual conflicts of interest related to students’ freedom to publish research resulting from thesis and dissertation research Financial conflicts of interests related to outside professional activities, including those in the private sector on faculty-supported projects The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) cautions that a “conflict of interest does not entail an accusation of wrongdoing. … A conflict of interest refers to a factual circumstance wherein an impartial observer might reasonably infer that a conflict is present.” Faculty should enlist their department chair or others to help manage potential conflicts of interest. Advisors who want advice when considering whether a potential conflict of interest concerning a student exists, and whether such a conflict can be reasonably managed or should be avoided, can consult with their department chair, the Graduate School, Cornell’s Office of Policy , or the Office of the Vice Provost for Research , depending on the specific circumstance. Personal Relationships with Graduate Students and the Consensual Relationship Policy Cornell’s consensual relationship policy, Policy 6.3 (December 21, 2018) describes relationships that are prohibited as well as those that are not prohibited but that must be disclosed. Prohibited sexual or romantic relationships include (1) those where a member of the Cornell community has academic or professional authority over a student, (2) those between a faculty member and an undergraduate student, and (3) those where a faculty member holds a position of authority or is likely to do in the foreseeable future. The policy specifically addresses relationships with graduate and professional students this way: Because a graduate or professional student’s educational pursuits may evolve and that student may become academically aligned with a large number of faculty members or others who are affiliated with the same graduate field or degree program, the university discourages all intra-field/degree program relationships that are romantic or sexual in nature. When a romantic relationship develops under these circumstances that may not directly violate Provisions 1-3 above, it is nonetheless important that the faculty member or other person in authority promptly discloses the relationship to Academic HR Consensual Relationship Reporting ( acadhr_reporting@cornell.edu ). In addition, relationships that meet one or more of the following criteria must also be disclosed to Academic HR: Faculty in a position of authority over a student when the relationship existed prior to one or both parties coming to Cornell. Faculty in a position of authority where both parties are in the same graduate field or degree program (albeit without an academic or supervisory relationship). Faculty currently in a relationship that is in violation of the current policy Further, the policy notes that “if clarification is desired regarding whether a relationship requires disclosure,” faculty should contact Academic HR Consensual Relationship Reporting ( acadhr_reporting@cornell.edu ).

Hours/Week for Standard Appointment² Maximum Additional Hours Per Week Permitted TA - An academic appointment in support of the teaching of a course of 15 to 20 hours per week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. The assignment is usually in the student's major field or a closely related one. TAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend. $33,930 $11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated 15 5 GA - An academic appointment requiring 15 to 20 hours a week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees.

RAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend. $33,930 $11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated 15 5 GRA - An academic appointment focused on thesis or other degree-related research of a type that is required from all candidates for the degree. Because a student devotes considerable time to dissertation research, the time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant. GRAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend. $33,930 $11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated A student’s time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant. 8 University Fellowship - An arrangement in which financial support is given to a graduate student to pursue his or her degree without any obligation on the part of the student to engage in teaching and/or research in furtherance of the university's academic mission. Generally, fellowships are merit-based awards.  Continued financial support is contingent upon the student maintaining satisfactory academic progress as defined by the graduate field and Graduate School. $33,930 $7,148, if summer funding is offered with fellowship N/A 8 Cornell Tech - Funded students located at the Cornell Tech campus generally receive a higher stipend linked to cost of living in the NYC area. $42,073 TBA TA/GA/RA - 15 GRA - A student's time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant. TA/GA/RA - 5 GRA/Fellowship - 8 [1] Weekly hours spent on summer appointments must comply with University Policy 1.3, and stipend rates must meet the Board of Trustees mandated minimum (nine-month) stipend rate, prorated for the number of weeks of the summer appointment. The length of the summer appointment (number of weeks) is determined by the Principal Investigator, department, unit, college, or other source of funding. [2] The maximum academic-year stipend amount that a graduate student may receive when any portion of the stipend comes from any funds held at Cornell (university accounts, college accounts, department accounts, unit accounts, or Principal Investigator sponsored funds) is $52,026. The increase may be from the same funding source as the basic stipend (an “adjustment”) or from a different source (a “supplement”). The limit applies to support from any combination of fellowships or assistantships when part of the stipend is paid from funds held at Cornell. There is no restriction on summer stipends and fellowships. Prorated Stipends for Non-Standard Appointments Minimum stipend rates for non-standard appointments classified as graduate assistantships (TA, GA, RA, or GRA) must be proportional to the board-approved stipend. Examples are provided in the table below. Partial assistantships must include tuition proportional to the stipend. That is, if a student receives a partial TAship with 50% stipend for the semester, the hours must be limited to 7.5 or less per week and he or she must receive 50% tuition for that semester in addition to the stipend. Awards that do not provide tuition and stipend in amounts proportional to the hours expected of a regular assistant are not assistantships and should not be portrayed as such. Examples – Adjusted Stipend Rates for Non-Standard Appointments 2024-25 Adjusted Stipend Rates for Non-standard Appointments Duration 15 hours/week (Standard) 7.5 hours 20 hours (Maximum) One Semester $16,965.00 $8,482.50 $22,620.00 Half-Semester $8,482.50 $4,241.25 $11,310.00 One Month $3,770.00 $1,885.00 $5,026.67 Summer (three months) $11,310.00 $5,655.00 $15,080.00 Full Year (12 months) $45,240.00 $22,620.00 N/A Assistantships for Professional Degree Students Students who are enrolled in professional degree programs are generally ineligible for assistantships outside of their graduate field of study, unless the director of graduate studies for the student’s program requests an exception based on the student gaining experience directly supporting the student’s ability to teach the subject matter of the profession. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by both the dean of the Graduate School and the dean of the college in which the professional degree program is housed. The college that administers the professional degree in which the student is enrolled is responsible for payment of the full tuition. Professional degree students may be appointed as graduate teaching/research specialists (GTRS) (see below). They may not accept an assistantship without: A signed letter from the director of graduate studies for the student’s program requesting an exception based on the student gaining experience directly supporting the student’s ability to teach the subject matter of the profession. A signed letter from the student’s college dean or dean’s designate indicating that the college will apply a tuition credit of at least $14,750 per semester. A signed letter from the Graduate School Dean or Associate Dean of Administration, approving the assistantship appointment. Graduate Teaching/Research Specialists Students in the professional degree programs may be appointed as graduate teaching/research specialists (GTRS). The GTRS is not an assistantship; GTRSs receive a stipend in proportion to the percent time of their appointment as compared to a full-time graduate assistantship but not tuition and health insurance. Hours are limited to no more than 10 per week. Before a program may begin using the GTRS title, approval must be given by the Graduate School.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Emergency Fund Program Emergency Fund Program The Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund Program assists Cornell graduate students experiencing urgent financial hardship due to unanticipated one-time expenses. This fund is intended to support the continued academic progress and well-being of students experiencing short-term financial hardship who cannot reasonably resolve their immediate financial needs through loans, aid programs, or personal resources. Only urgent needs and expenses incurred by the student directly will be considered. Grants of up to $500 are provided to help students offset necessary emergency expenses that cannot be funded by other means. Funding priority is based on the situation’s urgency, hardship level, and the student’s overall financial situation. Eligibility Requirements Students who can demonstrate need and are facing a current unexpected emergency may apply for this grant. Applicants must: Be enrolled for the semester at the time of the request. Students on a leave of absence are not eligible. Be enrolled in a degree program offered through Cornell’s Graduate School. This includes research degrees (M.A., M.S., or Ph.D.) and professional degrees administered through the Graduate School . If you are in an advanced-degree program that is administered outside of the Graduate School, you must seek emergency funding support through your college or school. Be in good academic standing with no current bursar holds. Guidelines The Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund was created to provide eligible students facing short-term, non-recurring emergencies with a one-time grant to alleviate the situation. Emergency funds are not intended to cover standard expenses included in the budgeted cost of attendance for the academic year (namely, tuition, fees, housing, and educational supplies); purchase of new technology or replacement of old technology; expenses incurred by someone other than the student; scholarly and professional conference attendance; fees and expenses related to post-graduation employment; costs associated with moving to or away from Ithaca; or loan repayment or credit card debt. In addition, it is not intended to provide financial support for the emergency expense in its entirety. Examples of Emergency Situations Examples of emergencies to be considered include, but are not limited to: Change in family circumstances Fire/flood in living quarters Homelessness or sudden change in housing situation Illness/death in the family Medical/dental emergencies Overdue utility bills/turn-off notice Theft of computers/books/clothing/other academic essentials Allowable Expenses Allowable expenses include but are not limited to: Travel costs related to unexpected crisis or death in the family Temporary housing for displacement due to fire, flood, or other unforeseen circumstances Replacement of items due to theft or damage Emergency medical or emergency dental expenses not covered by insurance Other unanticipated and urgent needs as appropriate Important Application Information Grants are awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis, and funds are limited. Students are only eligible for one award. The award does not require repayment. Expenses more than six months before the application date may not be covered. Grants may be taxable. The student is responsible for reporting the grant income and paying applicable taxes. Grant funds must be used for the purposes specified. Once your application has been received, decisions are typically made within seven business days. You will be notified of your application’s status at the end of that period and be informed of the next steps. Apply for the Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund . Other Resources Depending on your financial needs, some other programs administered outside of the Graduate School that may provide support include: Access Funds : This fund provides enrolled full-time undergraduate, graduate, and professional Cornell students with access to financial support, up to $500, to help mitigate on-campus barriers, access basic necessities, and cover emergency expenses not covered through financial aid or other university resources. CU Emergency Fund : The Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment (FASE) administers the CU Emergency Fund which assists currently enrolled students with urgent, unanticipated expenses. The fund is designed to assist with recent or upcoming emergency expenses that are above and beyond the standard cost of attendance. Costs such as technology, shipping, moving, or storage costs may be considered. Office of Global Learning Financial Emergency Support : Limited funding support may be available to international undergraduate, graduate, and professional students experiencing a health care or family emergency or unexpected expense. Food insecurity is a concern for many graduate students. A person who is food insecure has at times run out of money to buy food or run out of food before they could get more money. Additional support includes: Swipe Out Hunger Program : Cornell is a participant of the Swipe Out Hunger Program, through which students can request support or donate. Cornell Food Pantry : Cornell’s Food Pantry provides free, confidential access to food and personal care items to Cornell undergraduate and graduate students, as well as Cornell staff and faculty. For a complete listing of food resources available in Tompkins County, please consult with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County .

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Assistantships Assistantships Full-time Ph.D. and research master’s students may be awarded assistantships, which fall into four general categories: teaching assistant (TA), research assistant (RA), graduate assistant (GA), and graduate research assistant (GRA). These awards are administered by fields and departments. Assistantships are an arrangement in which financial support is given to a graduate student who engages in teaching and/or research in furtherance of the university’s academic mission, as well as his or her graduate education. Students on full assistantships receive the following: a stipend, a full tuition credit at the research degree rate , and Cornell individual student health insurance. Some fields may supplement the stipend and/or make summer appointments. See also: University Policy on Assistantships Applying Assistantships are awarded by departments, fields, and Principal Investigators. There is no separate application for assistantships. The assignment is usually in your major field or a closely-related one. Teaching Assistants (TAs) A teaching assistant is an academic appointment in support of the teaching of a course. Teaching assistants may assist in teaching a section of a course, lead discussions, and/or lead laboratory sections. Teaching assistants average no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. Special information for incoming international students: International students who come from countries where English is not the first language and who will TA in their first year at Cornell should visit the Center for Teaching Innovation’s International Teaching Assistant Program webpage for language assessment information. See also: On-Campus Work Support and resources for TAs: The Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) offers a central place where teaching assistants can go for insight and assistance with their teaching responsibilities, including programs and workshops for teaching assistants with all levels of experience. Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs) A GRA is an academic appointment focused on thesis or other degree-related research of a type that is required from all candidates for the degree. The research project for a GRA directly supports the student’s thesis or dissertation. Because a student devotes considerable time to thesis or dissertation research, the time spent is connected with the project. Research Assistantships (RAs) A RA is an academic appointment for research that is not directly thesis-related, 15 to 20 hours per week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week. For example, a RA appointment might include data analysis on a faculty research project not directly related to the student’s dissertation topic. As with other assistantships, there is no separate application. Students are appointed by departments, fields, or individual faculty. Graduate Assistantships (GAs) A GA is an academic appointment requiring 15 to 20 hours a week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week, for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. For example, a GA appointment might include assisting a faculty member in developing and coordinating an academic conference.

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Financial Support Financial Support At Cornell, tuition costs and financial support vary with field and degree program. Ninety-nine percent of Cornell’s Ph.D. students are fully funded to pursue their degrees through a combination of competitive internal and external fellowships and research and teaching assistantships. Funding packages include tuition, fees, health insurance, and a living allowance or stipend. Our base stipend rates for fellowships and assistantships are equivalent, consistent across graduate fields, and competitive with top other U.S. universities. Research master’s and professional degree programs at Cornell provide limited financial assistance. The terms of the awards may vary according to the program. For more information, please contact the individual professional program. Tuitions and Costs Tuition varies with field and degree program. Research degrees (M.S., M.A., and Ph.D.) are assessed different tuition rates than professional degrees. Tuition Rates Tuition Rates by Field Health Insurance Rates Cost of Attendance Stipend Rates Assistantships and Fellowships Assistantships are an arrangement in which financial support is given to a graduate student who engages in teaching and/or research in furtherance of the university’s academic mission, as well as his or her graduate education. A fellowship provides financial support to graduate students to pursue graduate studies without associated teaching or research responsibilities. Assistantships Fellowships Employment Limits Additional Sources of Financial Support The Graduate School strongly encourages students to apply for external fellowships and grants. These may be offered by government agencies, private foundations, or corporations, and may provide one year or multiple years of support. The Graduate School at the University of California, Los Angeles maintains one of the most extensive and up to date university databases on graduate school funding ( GRAPES ). Federal loans are also available to assist with tuition costs. Loans Travel Funding Opportunities Taxes At the graduate level, all fellowship and assistantship stipends are considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service and by New York State.

Congratulations on your acceptance into Cornell…and welcome! We are excited that you will begin your graduate program soon and look forward to working with you. The goal of the Graduate School Orientation at Cornell is simple: We want to warmly welcome you to campus and help your transition to graduate school by introducing you to the values, expectations, and resources of an inclusive Cornell community that will be your home for the duration of your degree program.  You will also learn about graduate study at Cornell along with expectations and tips for success as a new graduate student. We will introduce you to valuable resources and services to help you throughout your time at Cornell. Orientation does not replace your field’s orientation program; it supplements it. We hope it will help you experience the benefits of a larger, interdisciplinary community. Please consult your field’s website for field-, college-, and program-specific orientation programs. Please also make sure to keep track of your new student to do list. In late April, students will receive instructions directly for Graduate School Orientation via email. As details are refined, this website will be updated. Expect a complete schedule by July 1. Fall 2024 Orientation Highlights: Dean’s Welcome – August 22, 2024 The formal program features Cornell President Martha Pollack, Graduate School Dean and Vice Provost for Graduate Education Kathryn J. Boor and a panel of esteemed faculty and students. Grad Connect: A Resource Fair for Graduate and Professional Students – August 22, 2024 This collaborative resource fair will allow graduate and professional degree students from across programs to engage with each other while learning more about the resources, offices, and organizations that help support their development and progression at Cornell. Open to incoming and current students. Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series (via Zoom) This workshop series is designed exclusively for first-year graduate and professional students and covers topics like understanding doctoral funding, mentoring, and much more. Sessions are all online via Zoom.

and tradition grounded in academic freedom that encourages students to work across departments, disciplines, and colleges. As embodied in the graduate field structure, academic freedom is a foundational value for the Graduate School, which is a centralized unit, formally independent of the various colleges of the university. Fields of Study At Cornell, graduate study is organized using a field structure. Fields are composed of faculty members from a number of departments who come together around a shared intellectual interest, and may draw from different campuses or colleges. Our Fields of Study Understanding the Field Structure Fields of Study (PDF) Graduate Degrees The Graduate School offers research and professional degrees in nearly 100 fields of study, with opportunities for further exploration in 18 minor (non-degree granting) fields. Our Degree Programs In addition, Cornell offers these graduate degrees administered by colleges other than the Graduate School . Research and Scholarship With nearly $700 million in research expenditures, one of the 10 largest academic research libraries, top ranked graduate fields, and some of the best facilities in academia, Cornell University is consistently ranked as one of the most comprehensive universities in the world.
