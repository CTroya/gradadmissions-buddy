The program is ideal for self-motivated students who have expository skills, enjoy the research environment, and like working with undergraduates in introductory courses. Students in the program serve as teaching assistants and receive full tuition plus a stipend.Summary of Degree RequirementsAt least thirty-four credit hours of work is required. Six to twelve credit hours must be associated with thesis research (CS 7999). The remainder of the credit-hour requirement is fulfilled by taking between six and eight graduate-level courses. At least four of these courses must be CS courses at the 5000-level (or higher) and at least one of these must be at the 6000-level. An outside minor is required and that typically involves two or three graduate-level courses. A written thesis and oral presentation are also required.Financial SupportStudents who are admitted into the program serve as full time teaching assistants (TA’s) during each of the four semesters. This involves a fifteen-hour commitment to TA duties each week. In exchange, the student receives full tuition, a stipend to cover basic living expenses, and health insurance. Summer instructorships, TA-ships, and research assistantships are available but are not guaranteed. Serving as a TA is an integral part of the program. To remain in good standing in the program, students have to be among the top TAs in their assigned courses. TA performance is evaluated at the end of each semester.If you have questions regarding the MS in CS, please first check our FAQ.

In addition to representing the students in matters of university governance, the GPSA has the responsibility for setting and administering the student activity fee for graduate and professional students.The GPSA can serve as a valuable component of graduate or professional education for those who hope to be affiliated with a university in the future. Since the GPSA regularly meets with the president and provost and sends representatives to the University Assembly, the undergraduate Student Assembly, and the Faculty Senate, involvement in the GPSA can provide an introduction (or an advanced course!) to the mechanics of shared governance in a university setting.The GPSA:Represents graduate and professional student concerns to the university administration;Allocates funds to graduate and professional student groups and sets the student activity fee;Advocates for graduate and professional students on issues, including student resources, health care, insurance, transportation, and housing; andProvides support for graduate and professional student programming.To learn more about what the GPSA does, see the Graduate and Professional Community Initiative (GPCI), a strategic plan created by the GPSA to identify and address issues related to graduate and professional student life.                  Land AcknowledgementCornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ people, past and present, to these lands and waters.\rThis land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ leadership.

heart of campus and surrounded by lawns and gardens. A central place for eating and relaxing, the Barn hosts more than 500 events per year including trivia night, study/writing breaks, cultural celebrations, and the ever popular T.G.I.F. (Tell Grads It’s Friday). Connect with the Barn on Facebook and Instagram (@brbcornell) to stay up to date on Barn events and community-related news. HistoryThe Big Red Barn was built in the 1870s as the carriage house for the home of Cornell’s first president, Andrew Dickson White. The Barn, one of the oldest structures on campus, was converted to a social center by Cornell alumni in the 1950s and underwent a complete renovation in 1991. Antiques and farm implements recollect the building’s past, while new additions remain faithful to its rustic atmosphere.SettingThe spacious main portion of the building includes a stunning, but cozy, mezzanine. Tables and chairs cluster around a large grass pellet stove creating a warm setting for events. Upstairs mezzanine has lounge furniture for small group gatherings and leisurely study. The sunlit “greenhouse” has additional seating and access to the outdoor patio. It can be closed off for special functions.In warm weather, a brick patio and outdoor picnic tables surrounded by gardens are available. The first floor of the facility is accessible by ramp.LocationThe Big Red Barn is located behind the A.D. White House and next to the Space Sciences building.

the advancement of the representation, inclusion, and success of graduate students from historically underrepresented and marginalized populations. This includes supporting faculty engagement in discussions and workshops on holistic admissions practices, diversity recruitment practices, establishing more inclusive research and learning environments, and developing greater understanding of the experiences and identities represented in the graduate population. Staff are also available for individual consultations. To learn more, visit the Diversity & Inclusion page.Workshops/Panels on Advancing Diversity & Inclusion in Graduate EducationExploring Diversity Strategies for Graduate Recruitment & SelectionOISE provides consultations, and hosts invited speakers and facilitated panel discussions that focus on diversity recruitment strategies, equity-based holistic review practices in graduate admissions, and being aware of unconscious biases in the review of applications. For more information on diversity recruitment and holistic review resources, contact Sara Xayarath Hernández at grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu and Anitra Douglas McCarthy at amd78@cornell.edu.Equity-Based Holistic Review Workshops & Resources for Graduate AdmissionsEQUITABLE PRACTICES FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONThe recent SCOTUS decisions on SFFA v. Harvard/UNC have broad implications for admissions across all degree programs within and beyond Cornell. As part of our response, the Graduate School offers directors of graduate studies, graduate admissions chairs, and graduate fields assistants the opportunity to engage in workshops focused on maximizing equity and minimizing risk in graduate admissions through mission and values-driven strategies and tools. Since 2018, the Graduate School has been engaged in systemic change efforts to advance equity-based holistic review practices within graduate admissions, which have led to productive outcomes for many graduate fields. Moving forward, our efforts to maximize equity in graduate admissions must be combined with processes that will also minimize legal risk for the institution and those engaged in selection. These workshops allow us to provide an in-depth review of the Graduate School Admissions Rubric template, which all graduate fields are required to use, and how fields may build upon it to meet graduate field-specific needs to inform admissions decisions. During these sessions, we also review other aspects of holistic review practices and share recruitment, communication, and selection strategies considerate of our post-SCOTUS conditions.“Equity in Science” Book Talk with Author and Professor Julie PosseltThe Graduate School Offices of Inclusion & Student Engagement and Future Faculty and Academic Careers held a discussion with Julie R. Posselt, associate professor of higher education at the University of Southern California, on her book, Equity in Science: Representation, Culture and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education.Equity in Science: Representation, Culture, and the Dynamics of Change in Graduate Education“STEM disciplines are believed to be founded on the idea of meritocracy; recognition earned by the value of the data, which is objective. Such disciplinary cultures resist concerns about implicit or structural biases, and yet, year after year, scientists observe persistent gender and racial inequalities in their labs, departments, and programs. In ‘Equity in Science,’ Julie Posselt makes the case that understanding how field-specific cultures develop is a crucial step for bringing about real change. She does this by examining existing equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts across astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, and psychology. These ethnographic case studies reveal the subtle ways that exclusion and power operate in scientific organizations and, sometimes, within change efforts themselves. Posselt argues that accelerating the movement for inclusion in science requires more effective collaboration across boundaries that typically separate people and scholars—across the social and natural sciences, across the faculty-student-administrator roles, and across race, gender, and other social identities. Ultimately this book is a call for academia to place equal value on expertise, and on those who do the work of cultural translation. Posselt closes with targeted recommendations for individuals, departments, and disciplinary societies for creating systemic, sustainable change.”Cornell community members can access a recording of the “Equity in Science” book talk.Cornell community members can access a free copy of the e-book.Equity in Science book discussion guideChapter 1: Equity Work as ScienceChapter 2: Managing Complexity in Institutional ChangeChapter 3: Eroded Boundaries & Everyday Interactions in Geoscience FieldworkChapter 4: Impression Management & Organizational Learning in Psychology & ChemistryChapter 5: Inclusive Design & Disciplinary Boundary Work in Applied PhysicsChapter 6: Advocacy and Management in Astronomy and PhysicsChapter 7: Retooling Science Through Cultural TranslationExploring Strategies to Advance Inclusive Mentoring PracticesFaculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) is an equity-based systemic change initiative that provides a framework for inclusive mentorship applicable across graduate education and the professoriate. Bolstering this framework are resources and tools intended to be adapted and adopted to meet the contextual needs of mentors and mentees. FAIM is a collaboration of the Cornell Graduate School and Provost Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and the TRUST Alliance, which includes collaborators at Cornell, Montana State, and Purdue Universities.The Graduate School provides workshops, individual faculty consultations, and hosts invited speakers and facilitated panel discussions that focus on advancing inclusive mentoring practices and cultures within graduate education and academia.

We will talk about what gets in our way of leveraging the power ofmentorship to close equity gaps in the academy, and I will offer a framework for thinking about identity in the context of our relationships. We will also talk about promising practices and strategies that can enhance our ability to form mentoring relationships grounded in equity, affirmation, and care. Cornell community members can access a recording of this talk. Culturally Attuned Mentoring Paradigms – Relationships in Community ContextSpeaker: Dr. Sweeney Windchief (Fort Peck Assiniboine Tribe), Associate Professor of Adult and Higher Education at Montana State UniversityHow do mentors learn to mentor? Professional mentoring in higher education typically mirrors higher education in the contemporary American context, meaning that we tend to mentor the way we were mentored. This presentation builds upon the implementation of a program designed to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of faculty who mentor American Indian and Alaska Native graduate students in the STEM fields and is recalibrated for current faculty in other fields as well as those considering academia as a career. The goal of this session is for participants to consider how they can become active in co-constructing their own, identity informed, professional mentor/mentee platform. We also will discuss the concept of self-authorship in order to activate one’s own agency in developing a “constellation of mentors”. Different Institutional types and the specific disciplines in which we work have their own unique cultures, geographies, infrastructure, and resources that need to be considered.Cornell community members can access a recording of this talk.Faculty Roundtable Discussion Series on Graduate Student MentoringThe Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and the Graduate School Offices of Inclusion and Student Engagement, and Future Faculty and Academic Careers collaboratively host faculty roundtable discussions on topics related to graduate student mentoring practices. Topics for these discussions include defining and managing expectations, recognizing and managing power dynamics, productively managing conflict, matching work style preferences, and understanding motivation.

These agreements help set both practical norms and broader intentions of how we want to approach the conversation. (This guide is for the broader Cornell community.) Listening & Learning with “I” StatementsThis guide is an accompaniment to our podcast, “I” Statements, where people with different identities come together to share their own beliefs, experiences, and perspectives, demonstrating both the power and the possibility inherent in communicating across difference. This guide is for people who would like to incorporate the podcast into their work with students and/or colleagues. (This guide is for educators more broadly.)Political ConversationsThis guide was prepared in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Although it refers specifically to this election, we believe the content here is applicable to many conversations people may wish to engage in surrounding politics. (This guide is for the broader Cornell community.)Using LARALARA stands for listen, affirm, respond, and add information. The overarching aim of this tool is to encourage communication across difference (whether of identities, perspectives, or experiences). As a communication tool, LARA can be useful in building connection and trust with others, creating space for the exploration of multiple – even conflicting – perspectives, and bringing emotions, assumptions, and social identities into the conversation. The aim of LARA is to help steer a conversation towards mutual understanding of each other’s identities, lived experiences, and positions. (This guide is for the broader Cornell community.)

For questions and consultation, contact cornellhealth@cornell.edu. InterveneIn the Intervene workshop, students view a brief video demonstrating ways in which student bystanders can successfully intervene in problematic situations. Seven different situations are addressed, including: sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence (emotional abuse), an alcohol emergency, emotional distress, hazing, and racial bias. Following the video, there is an opportunity for students to engage in a facilitated conversation to reflect upon the attitudes and behaviors that influence the process of intervening as an individual or with assistance. To schedule a session, please contact Laura Santacrose at LBS65@cornell.edu.Sexual Violence Awareness & ResponseInteractive discussions are tailored for groups requesting programs on sexual violence, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, healthy and unhealthy relationships, etc. Participants are given tools and information to help them understand definitions and concepts, available resources, how to be an active bystander, and how to respond to a friend, colleague, or student who has shared an experience of abuse or violence. To schedule a session, please contact Laura Weiss at lbw26@cornell.edu.Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX – Responsibility to ReportAs part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion, Cornell makes a concerted effort to ensure that our community can identify potential acts of sexual and related misconduct and knows who to contact and consult with if they learn about or experience sexual or related misconduct. Our aim is to make sure campus remains a safe and respectful academic and workplace environment focused on education. The staff of the Office of the Title IX Coordinator, together with our community partners, is available to provide in-person trainings to staff or faculty. If your department or unit is interested in a training, please contact titleix@cornell.edu.Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment TrainingHR 200 “Respect@Cornell”“Addressing Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment” is required of all new employees at Cornell, replacing our previous program, “Building a Culture of Respect at Cornell.” This program, with an introduction from Cornell University President Martha Pollack, provides information on Cornell employee rights, responsibilities, and resources with respect to sexual and related misconduct and sexual harassment. It addresses how to respond should faculty or staff learn a member of our community has experienced any type of sexual violence or stalking and also lets faculty and staff know how to file a complaint.Federal law requires all faculty and staff to receive information about sexual assault/violence, domestic violence, dating violence (also known as intimate partner violence), and stalking prevention and response. The Title IX Office hopes and expects all current faculty and staff take this online course as part of their ongoing education and training mandates.HR 201 “Maintaining a Harassment-Free Workplace”HR 201 is a brief review of Cornell’s policy prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace, including video examples of how to address and counsel employees subjected to workplace harassment and resources available to all Cornell employees on these topics.“Duty to Consult” TrainingThere is a community responsibility for creating a safer, more caring campus culture in which bias, harassment, and violence have no place—and every member of our community is free to flourish. One of the many ways in which Cornell lives up to this commitment is through the “Duty to Consult” with the Title IX Coordinator, a responsibility set forth in Policy 6.4 and long incumbent upon all staff and faculty members (with the important exception of confidential resources), when they become aware of an alleged incident of sexual and related misconduct under this policy, such as dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, that involves a student as either the complainant or respondent.This brief online training reviews the “Duty to Consult,” the importance of maintaining a student’s privacy, available confidential resources, and what does and does not happen when a member of the staff or faculty consults with the Title IX Coordinator, as well as providing information and resources for handling difficult conversations with students who choose to share experiences of sexual and related misconduct with you.Sexual Harassment and Assault – Response and Education (SHARE)SHARE offers resources and education related to sexual harassment and assault. Visit the SHARE website for more information.Office of Postdoctoral StudiesThe Office of Postdoctoral Studies monitors the status and needs of the postdoctoral campus community and serves as an advocate for postdoctoral issues to the vice provost for research and Cornell’s administration.

GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolDiversity & InclusionBouchet Honor SocietyBouchet Honor SocietyYale University and Howard University established the Edward A. Bouchet Graduate Honor Society in 2005. Named for the first African American doctoral recipient in the United States (Ph.D. from Yale University in 1876), the Bouchet Society recognizes outstanding scholarly achievement and promotes diversity and excellence in doctoral education and the professoriate. Outside of the society’s founding universities, Yale and Howard, Cornell was among the earliest universities to establish a Chapter of the Bouchet Society with its first members inducted in 2006.The Bouchet Society seeks to develop a network of preeminent scholars who exemplify academic and personal excellence, foster environments of support and serve as examples of CLASS: Character, Leadership, Advocacy, Scholarship, and Service. In the spirit of Bouchet’s commitment to these pursuits both within and without the academic realm, inductees into the honor society exhibit these qualities and demonstrate a commitment to advancing diversity, inclusion, access, and equity in the academy, especially by those from backgrounds historically underrepresented in higher education.Prospective Cornell Bouchet inductees must be an advanced doctoral candidate (priority consideration provided to those closest to completion), or a postdoc, faculty member, and/or academic affairs administrator with a Ph.D. Though priority consideration is provided to advanced doctoral candidates, the Cornell Bouchet Chapter also seeks to expand through the inclusion of a limited number of postdocs, faculty, and/or academic affairs administrators with a Ph.D.All prospective Cornell Bouchet inductees must be interested in or already on a faculty or academic career pathway and exemplify the following:record of academic and personal excellence foster environments of belonging and supportserve as examples of character, leadership, advocacy, scholarship, and service within higher educationcommitment to advancing diversity, equity, access, and inclusion in higher educationsupport access by and advancement of scholars from backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in the academy Bouchet Society Selection TimelineEarly December– Solicitation for applications from advanced doctoral candidates, postdocs, faculty, and administrators who embody the characteristics of Dr. Bouchet as expressed through the five thrusts of the society: Character, Leadership, Advocacy, Scholarship, and Service.Early January– Completed applications and two letters of recommendation due on January 11, 2024.Late January – Selection of new scholars announced.Late March/Early April – Annual Yale Bouchet Conference on Diversity and Graduate Education.Mid April – Induction of new scholars at Cornell.All scholars also participate in ongoing professional development opportunities through the Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement, Office of Postdoctoral Studies, and our partners.

GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolAcademic ProgressAdvising Guide for Research StudentsAdvising Guide for Research StudentsSuccess as a graduate student is a shared responsibility between students and faculty. For research students, the relationship with your research advisor, also known as your special committee chair, is extremely important. Your responsibility to identify and choose an advisor is one of the most critical tasks you have early in your graduate school career. It’s an opportunity to meet and get to know faculty in your field, to assess your needs for support and supervision, and to collaboratively define your goals, values, and strategic plan for your academic and professional career.Graduate School RequirementAt Cornell, the faculty advisor in research degree programs is referred to as the special committee chair.Doctoral students have a special committee of at least three Cornell faculty, which includes the special committee chair and two minor committee members.Master’s students have a special committee of at least two Cornell faculty, which includes the special committee chair and one minor member.For both doctoral and master’s degree students, the special committee chair must be a graduate faculty member in the student’s own field.Definition of an AdvisorAdvising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, but understanding the distinctions is important as you choose an advisor.Advisor ResponsibilitiesGuides you in meeting the requirements and expectations for your degreeHelps you develop a plan for completing your program that includes specific milestones and deadlines for the following:Required courseworkExams required by the graduate field or the Graduate SchoolResearch proposal/prospectusResearch projectThesis or dissertationWrites informed letters of recommendation for your job applicationsMay be a valued colleague or collaborator after you graduateMentor ResponsibilitiesProvides support and guidance that extends beyond scope of advisingDemystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate educationExpands your professional network by introducing you to othersProvides nominations for awards or other recognitionsBrings job opportunities to your attention and writes letters of recommendation as you apply for jobsAdvocates for you within the graduate program and disciplineMay serve as a role model and source of inspirationMay become a colleague and peer in your discipline and may continue serving a mentoring roleFinding an Advisor When do I select my first advisor?At Cornell, the process for obtaining your first advisor varies by field.Your faculty advisor may be assigned prior to your arrival or you may begin your program with a faculty member you met during the application process.In some graduate fields, the faculty director of graduate studies (DGS) advises all incoming students. This provides you with time to get to know faculty in your field. By the end of the first semester or year (varying by field), it’s expected that you will have identified your own, long-term advisor. In fields where students apply to study with a specific faculty member (rather than do rotations and choose a lab or research group and advisor), you will have chosen an advisor prior to arriving on campus.You can begin initial conversations about expectations and the advising relationship with your new advisor prior to the start of your program via email.Start your graduate study and research with clear expectations and thoughtful communication about your plans for an effective advising relationship and success in graduate school.How do I find an advisor? Meet and get to know faculty in your courses and in graduate field seminars and other events.Talk to advanced students about their experiences and perceptions of the faculty in your programs and ask questions about possible advisors:How would you describe their approach to advising?What can you tell me about their work style?What can you tell me about their research interests?How good are their communication skills?How clear are their expectations for their graduate students?Do they use timeliness in reviewing their students’ writing and their approach to giving feedback?How available are they to meet with their graduate students?After you have gathered information, make an appointment to meet with a potential advisor.Possible QuestionsIs there a typical timeline you encourage your students to follow in completing their degree programs?How often do you meet with your students at different stages of their graduate program? (For example, during coursework, research, and writing stages)What are your expectations for students to make conference presentations and submit publications?What are your authorship policies? (This is especially relevant in fields where there is collaborative research and publishing involving the student and advisor or a group of students, postdocs, and faculty.)How soon should I identify my research project?How do you describe the degree of guidance and supervision you provide with regards to your students becoming more independent in their research and scholarship?If you are joining a lab or research group: What are the sources of funding for this research? Are there any new or pending research grants?How many of your students seek, and secure, external funding? What are your expectations for students to apply for external fellowships?Do you have a statement of advising you can share that lists our respective responsibilities and clarifies mutual expectations?What’s your advice on how students can manage what they find to be the biggest challenges in their graduate program?Add other questions to your list based on your own needs and specifics of your program, such as questions about specialized equipment, lab safety, travel to field sites, support and accommodations for special health needs, communication during a faculty member’s sabbatical, funding in fields where there are fewer fellowships and research grants, etc.Getting Other Mentoring Needs MetHow do I find other mentor(s)? You may find one faculty member who can serve as both advisor and mentor, but that’s not always the case.Consider identifying and cultivating additional mentors if that is the case. Suggestions on where to look for a mentor:The minor members of your special committeeA faculty member who is not on your committee, and perhaps not even in your graduate fieldPeers and postdoctoral fellows who have knowledge and experience in pertinent issuesNo one mentor can meet all your needs.Good mentors have many protégés and many other demands on their time, such as teaching, research, and university or professional service. They also may not have all the expertise you need, for example, if you decide to search for jobs in multiple employment sectors.Develop a broad network of mentors whose expertise varies and who provide different functions based on your changing needs as you progress from new student to independent scholar and researcher.NCFDD offers a webinar, “Cultivating Your Network of Mentors, Sponsors, and Collaborators“, which students can view after activating a free NCFDD membership through Cornell.Maximizing the Advising RelationshipA successful relationship with your advisor depends on several different factors and varies with needs and working styles of the individuals. Some of these factors are under your control. But some are not. Suggestions for Building a Successful Advising RelationshipIdentify what you need from an advisor.Communicate clearly and frequently with your advisor to convey your questions, expectations, goals, challenges, and degree progress. Follow up verbal communication and meetings with an email detailing your understanding of what you both agreed to and next steps.Develop written academic and Individual Development Plans that include your career goals, your program’s degree requirements and milestones, funding and financial aid, and a timeline with your anticipated deadlines.Update your written academic plan each semester or whenever major changes or adjustments are needed.Use your annual Student Progress Review, required by the Graduate School, effectively to record your progress, articulate your goals and plans to meet academic milestones, and seek feedback from your advisor.Consider including your plans to write competitive fellowship applications and co-authored grant proposals.Consider including plans for professional development that support your skill-building objectives and career goals.Recognize that you and your advisor have distinct perspectives, backgrounds, and interests. Share yours. Listen to your advisor’s. There is mutual benefit to sharing and learning from this diversity.Work with your advisor to define a regular meeting schedule. Prepare and send written materials in advance of each meeting. These could include: your questions, academic and research plan and timeline, and drafts of current writing projects, such as fellowship applications, manuscripts, or thesis/dissertation chapters.Be prepared to negotiate, show flexibility, and compromise, as is important for any successful relationship.Be as candid as you are comfortable with about your challenges and concerns. Seek guidance about campus and other resources that can help you manage and address any obstacles.Reach out to others for advice. Anticipate challenges and obstacles in your graduate degree program and their impact on the advising relationship.Be proactive in finding resources and gathering information that can help you and your advisor arrive at solutions to any problems and optimize your time together.Making Use of MeetingsFirst MeetingsYour first meeting sets the tone for a productive, satisfying, and enduring relationship with your advisor. Your first meeting is an opportunity to discuss expectations and to review a working draft of your academic plan.Questions to ask about expectationsWhat do your most successful students do to complete their degree on time?How often do you want us to meet?May I send you questions via email, or do you prefer I just come to your office?Would you like weekly (biweekly? monthly?) updates on my research progress?Do you prefer reviewing the complete draft of a manuscript or may I send you sections for feedback?After each meeting, I’ll make a list of what we each agreed to do before our next meeting, to help me keep moving forward with my research. Would you like a copy of that list, too, via email?Draft Academic PlanPrepare and bring a draft plan that outlines your “big picture” plans for your coursework, research, and writing, as well as an anticipated graduation date. (Or, email in advance with a message, such as, “I’m looking forward to meeting with you on [date] at [time], [location]. In advance, I’m sending a copy of my academic plan and proposed schedule for our discussion.”)Contents of the planInclude the requirements and deadlines of your degree program. (This is information you should be able to find online or in your program’s graduate student handbook.)Include a general timeline indicating when you plan to meet requirements for courses or seminars, any required papers (such as a second-year paper), exams required by the graduate field (such as the Q exam) or by the Graduate School (the A exam and the B exam for research degree students).If your graduate field has a specific set of required courses, indicate the semester you may complete each of them, and be open to suggestions from your advisor.If your field does not have required courses, have some idea about the courses you are interested in taking and solicit input and suggestions from your faculty advisor.Subsequent MeetingsUse each subsequent meeting as an opportunity to update your written academic plan and stay on track to complete your required papers and exams, your research proposal or prospectus, and the chapters or articles that comprise your thesis or dissertation.In later meetings, you can elaborate on your general initial plan:Adding specific coursework or seminarsAdd professional development opportunities that interest you (workshops, dissertation writing boot camp, Summer Success Symposium, Colman Leadership Program, etc.)Include intentions to participate in external conferences and travel to research sitesIdentify a semester or summer when you would like to complete an internship.Your written plan is also important to document what your advisor has agreed to, especially when the deadline to submit a manuscript or your thesis is looming and you are awaiting feedback or approval from your advisor. Use a combination of oral and written communications to stay in touch with your advisor, establish common expectations, and mark your progress toward degree completion.Meeting FrequencyThe frequency of meetings between advisors and advisees varies by field and individual. Assess your own needs and understand your advisor’s expectations for frequency of communication (in person and via email).Does your advisor like to provide guidance each step of the way so that he or she is aware of the details of everything you are doing?Does your advisor want you to launch your work more independently and report back at pre-determined or regular intervals?What do you need to be productive? Are you ready to work more independently?Be proactive in seeking information. Explicitly ask how often your advisor usually meets with new students and how the advisor prefers to be updated on your progress in between meetings. Ask your peers how frequently they meet with their advisor and whether this has changed over time.There will be disciplinary differences in meeting frequency.In humanities and in some social sciences, where library, archive, and field research take students away from campus, maintaining regular communication is essential, including through scheduled meetings, whether in-person or virtual.In life sciences and physical sciences and engineering, students often see their advisors daily in the lab or meet as a research group about externally funded projects; these regular check-ins and conversations may replace formal meetings. Make sure that you are also scheduling one-on-one times to talk about your broader goals and academic and career planning progress, however.Some of your decisions about meeting frequency will be informed by talking to others, but much of it you learn through experience working together with your advisor. Even this will change over time as you become a more independent researcher and scholar. Communicate with your advisor regularly about your changing needs and expectations at each stage of your graduate career.Resolving ConflictIn any relationship, there can be conflict. And, in the advisor-advisee relationship, the power dynamic created by the supervision, evaluation and, in some cases, funding role of your advisor can make conflicts with your advisor seem especially high.You have options, however, including:Reviewing the Cornell and Graduate School polices. They provide clear expectations, help you manage problems when they occur, and protect you from retribution when trying to address these problems. Examples of these policies include:Code of Legislation of the Graduate FacultyCampus Code of ConductPolicy on Academic MisconductResearch MisconductGraduate School Grievance PolicyIntellectual Property policiesGraduate Student Assistantships (Policy 1.3)Talking with your advisor to clarify any miscommunication. Cornell University’s Office of the Ombudsman, one of the offices on campus that offers confidentiality, can also assist you by talking through the issue and helping you gather information you need before you speak directly with your advisor.Speaking with someone in the Graduate School, either the Associate Dean for Academics (gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu) for academic issues, or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life (janna.lamey@cornell.edu) for other issues. These deans will listen, offer advice and support, and coach you through any conversation you might want to have with your advisor. Together, you can brainstorm possible solutions and evaluate alternative plans for resolution.Touching base with your director of graduate studies (DGS) – if this person is not also your advisor – to talk to about policies and possible solutions to the conflict.Soliciting peer advice. Discuss strategies for managing and resolving conflict with your advisor. “Do you have any suggestions for me?” “Have you ever had an issue like this…?” can be effective questions.Identifying a new advisor if the conflict can not be resolved. Your DGS can help with this, and the Graduate School (as above) can help as well.The National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity offers a webinar, “How to Engage in Healthy Conflict“, which students can view after activating a free NCFDD membership through Cornell.Changing AdvisorsOn occasion, students find that they need or want to change their advisor. An advisor can resign as the student’s special committee chair/faculty advisor. The Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty describes the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty in each of these situations.Typical reasons to seek a new advisor include:Research interests that veer from the faculty’s expertise or ability to fund a certain projectYour advisor retires or resigns from the university or takes an extended leave of absence for personal or professional reasonsDifferences in goals, values, or an approach to work or communication style that can’t be resolvedSerious issues, involving suspected inappropriate behavior, questionable research conduct, or alleged bias, discrimination, or harassmentIf you are considering changing advisors:Talk to a member of your committee, your director of graduate studies (DGS), or someone in the Graduate School about the proposed change. Some issues, such as funding, require timely attention.Identify other faculty members who could serve as your advisor, then meet with one or more of them. The goal is to decide together if you are a good fit with their program. Tips: Discuss or rehearse this conversation with a trusted person, especially if there were issues with your last advisor. Be transparent about these issues and address them going forward with a new advisor. Often prospective advisors are more willing to take on a new graduate student who conveys genuine enthusiasm for their area of study rather than a student who seems to be looking for a way out of a current advising relationship that has gone sour.Consider how and when to inform your advisor if you plan to change advisors. Be professional and respectful. Thank your advisor for past support and guidance. Don’t damage, or further damage, the relationship.Faculty may have professional relationships with each other and in some cases personal relationships. Consider how such relationships may influence your choices in changing advisors and consider asking the following people to help you navigate complicated situations.Your DGS, if appropriateOffice of the University OmbudsmanGraduate School’s Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life (janna.lamey@cornell.edu)Graduate School’s Associate Dean for Academics (gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu)Forms: Use Student Center if you are changing your advisor before your A exam (for Ph.D. students).Use the Post A Committee Change Petition form for changes after the A exam. More information is available on the Graduate School’s Policy pages.Challenges and Potential SolutionsAll good relationships take work. To navigate an advising relationship successfully over time, you should familiarize yourself with some common challenges and possible actions to take.Challenge: Mismatch in communication needs or styleOne example of a communication challenge in an advising relationship is when you want input along the way during a writing project, but you have an advisor who prefers to wait to comment on a complete written draft.Some possible steps to address this might be to talk to peers about they have handled this in their relationship with their advisor or to explain to your advisor how his or her input at this earlier stage will help speed you along toward having a complete draft for review. It’s important in communicating with your advisor to show that you understand what alternative they are proposing and why (e.g., “I understand that …”).Challenge: Advisor unavailable or awayYour advisor might be away from campus for a semester or more to conduct research or take a sabbatical leave. Or when a grant proposal deadline or report is looming, your advisor might be less available. Maybe you’ve emailed your advisor several times with no response.Planning and stating in advance what you need, such as feedback on a manuscript draft or signatures on a fellowship application, can help your advisor anticipate when you will have time-sensitive requests. Making plans in advance to communicate by email or video conference when either of you will be away from campus for a longer period of time is another useful strategy. Your director of graduate studies (DGS) and other faculty who serve as special committee members can also provide advice when your advisor is unavailable.Challenge: Misaligned expectationsYou are ready to submit a manuscript for publication. Your advisor says it needs much more work. Or you begin your job search, applying to liberal arts colleges with very high reputations, or schools in your preferred geographic location, but your advisor insists that you should apply for positions at top research universities.Discussing your needs and expectations early, and often, in the advising relationship is essential. Get comfortable, and skilled, advocating for yourself with your advisor. Use the annual Student Progress Review as an opportunity to communicate your professional interests and goals with your advisor. Use multiple mentors beyond your advisor to get advice and expertise on topics where you need a different perspective or support.Sometimes challenges can become opportunities for you to develop and refine new skills in communication, negotiation, self-advocacy, and management of conflict, time, and resources. For example, although you might feel abandoned if your advisor is unavailable for a time, even this potentially negative experience could become an opportunity to learn how to advocate for yourself and communicate about your needs and perceived difficulties in the relationship.Advising ResourcesOn CampusGraduate School deans and directors are available to answer academic and non-academic questions and provide referrals to useful resources.Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) staff offer confidential, professional support for students seeking help with stress, anxiety, depression, grief, adjustment challenges, relationship difficulties, questions about identity, and managing existing mental health conditions.Let’s Talk Drop-in Consultations are informal, confidential walk-in consultations at various locations around campus.External ResourcesUniversity of Michigan Rackham, How to Get the Mentoring You Want Laura Gail Lunsford & Vicki L.

GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolAcademic ProgressAdvising Guide for Professional StudentsAdvising Guide for Professional StudentsSuccess as a graduate student is a shared responsibility between students and faculty. Your responsibility to identify and choose an advisor is one of the most critical tasks you have early in your graduate school career. It’s an opportunity to meet and get to know faculty in your field, to assess your needs for support and supervision, and to collaboratively define your goals, values, and strategic plan for your academic and professional career.Advisors and Program Directors in Professional Degree ProgramsAll professional degree students must have an advisor. In some fields, this person may be the program director, who is responsible for general oversight of the program, including admissions, curriculum development, degree requirements, and student progress toward degree completion. In other fields, students may have a faculty advisor who works closely with the program director.Professional degree programs are course-based. Satisfactory progress to the degree depends on completion of required and elective courses while maintaining at least the minimum grade point average (GPA) specified by the field.Professional degree program requirements are defined by faculty in each field. These requirements, as well as the length of time allowed to complete them, vary by field, so the advisor has an essential role in helping their students identify and meet all requirements for the degree. Difference between an Advisor and a MentorAdvising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, but understanding the distinctions is important as you choose an advisor.Advisor ResponsibilitiesGuides you in meeting the requirements and expectations for your degreeHelps you develop a plan for completing your program that includes specific milestones and deadlines for the following:Required courseworkExams required by the graduate field Fieldwork, internship, or other capstone experienceWrites informed letters of recommendation for your job applicationsMentor ResponsibilitiesProvides support and guidance that extends beyond scope of advisingDemystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate educationExpands your professional network by introducing you to othersProvides nominations for awards or other recognitionsBrings job opportunities to your attention and writes letters of recommendation as you apply for jobsAdvocates for you within the graduate program and professionMay serve as a role model and source of inspirationMay become a colleague and peer in your discipline and may continue serving a mentoring roleFinding an Advisor When do I select my first advisor?At Cornell, the process for obtaining your first advisor varies by field.Your faculty advisor may be assigned prior to your arrival or you may select an advisor during your first semester. Either way, it’s important to start your graduate study with clear expectations and thoughtful communication about your plans for an effective advising relationship and success in graduate school.How do I find an advisor? Meet and get to know faculty in your courses and in graduate field seminars and other events.Talk to advanced students about their experiences and perceptions of the faculty in your programs and ask questions about possible advisors:How would you describe their approach to advising?What can you tell me about their work style?What can you tell me about their research interests?How good are their communication skills?How clear are their expectations for their graduate students?Do they use timeliness in reviewing their students’ writing and their approach to giving feedback?How available are they to meet with their graduate students?After you have gathered information, make an appointment to meet with a potential advisor.Possible QuestionsHow often do you meet with your students?What are your expectations for students related to professional development and networking, such as attending conferences or making presentations?How soon should I identify a fieldwork or internship site or project for my capstone experience, if required?How do you describe the degree of guidance and supervision you provide? At what point do you expect your students to begin to work more independently?  Do you have a statement of advising you can share that lists our respective responsibilities and clarifies mutual expectations?What’s your advice on how students can manage what they find to be the biggest challenges in their graduate program?Getting Other Mentoring Needs MetHow do I find other mentor(s)? You may find one faculty member who can serve as both advisor and mentor, but that’s not always the case.Consider identifying and cultivating additional mentors if that is the case. No one mentor can meet all of your needs. Good mentors have many protégés and many other demands on their time, such as teaching, research, and university or professional service. They also may not have all the expertise you need, for example, if you decide to search for jobs in multiple employment sectors.Develop a broad network of mentors whose expertise varies and who provide different functions based on your changing needs as you progress from new student to independent scholar and researcher.Maximizing the Advising RelationshipA successful relationship with your advisor depends on several different factors and varies with needs and working styles of the individuals. Some of these factors are under your control. But some are not. Suggestions for Building a Successful Advising RelationshipIdentify what you need from an advisor.Communicate clearly and frequently with your advisor to convey your questions, expectations, goals, challenges, and degree progress. Follow up verbal communication and meetings with an email detailing your understanding of what you both agreed to and next steps.Develop written academic and Individual Development Plans that include your career goals, your program’s degree requirements and milestones, funding and financial aid, and a timeline with your anticipated deadlines.Update your written academic plan each semester or whenever major changes or adjustments are needed.Consider including plans for professional development that support your skill-building objectives and career goals.Recognize that you and your advisor have distinct perspectives, backgrounds, and interests. Share yours. Listen to your advisor’s. There is mutual benefit to sharing and learning from this diversity.Work with your advisor to define a regular meeting schedule. Prepare and send written materials in advance of each meeting. These could include: your questions, academic and research plan and timeline, and drafts of current writing projects, such as fellowship applications, manuscripts, or thesis/dissertation chapters.Be prepared to negotiate, show flexibility, and compromise, as is important for any successful relationship.Be as candid as you are comfortable with about your challenges and concerns. Seek guidance about campus and other resources that can help you manage and address any obstacles.Reach out to others for advice. Anticipate challenges and obstacles in your graduate degree program and their impact on the advising relationship.Be proactive in finding resources and gathering information that can help you and your advisor arrive at solutions to any problems and optimize your time together.Making Use of MeetingsFirst MeetingsYour first meeting sets the tone for a productive, satisfying, and enduring relationship with your advisor. Your first meeting is an opportunity to discuss expectations and to review a working draft of your academic plan.Questions to ask about expectationsWhat do your most successful students do to complete their degrees on time?How often do you want us to meet?May I send you questions via email, or do you prefer I just come to your office?Would you like weekly (biweekly? monthly?) updates on my research progress?Do you prefer reviewing the complete draft of a manuscript or may I send you sections for feedback?After each meeting, I’ll make a list of what we each agreed to do before our next meeting to help me keep moving forward with my research. Would you like a copy of that list, too, via email?Draft Academic PlanPrepare and bring a draft plan that outlines your “big picture” plans for your coursework, research, and writing, as well as an anticipated graduation date. (Or, email in advance with a message, such as, “I’m looking forward to meeting with you on [date] at [time], [location]. In advance, I’m sending a copy of my academic plan and proposed schedule for our discussion.”)Contents of the planInclude the requirements and deadlines of your degree program. (This is information you should be able to find online or in your program’s graduate student handbook.)Include a general timeline indicating when you plan to meet requirements for courses or seminars, any required papers (such as a second-year paper), exams required by the graduate field (such as the Q exam) or by the Graduate School (the A exam and the B exam for research degree students).If your graduate field has a specific set of required courses, indicate the semester you may complete each of them, and be open to suggestions from your advisor.If your field does not have required courses, have some idea about the courses you are interested in taking and solicit input and suggestions from your faculty advisor.Subsequent MeetingsUse each subsequent meeting as an opportunity to update your written academic plan and stay on track to complete your required papers and exams, your research proposal or prospectus, and the chapters or articles that comprise your thesis or dissertation.In later meetings, you can elaborate on your general initial plan:Adding specific coursework or seminarsAdd professional development opportunities that interest you (workshops, dissertation writing boot camp, Summer Success Symposium, Colman Leadership Program, etc.)Include intentions to participate in external conferences and travel to research sitesIdentify a semester or summer when you would like to complete an internship.Your written plan is also important to document what your advisor has agreed to, especially when the deadline to submit a manuscript or your thesis is looming and you are awaiting feedback or approval from your advisor. Use a combination of oral and written communications to stay in touch with your advisor, establish common expectations, and mark your progress toward degree completion.Meeting FrequencyThe frequency of meetings between advisors and advisees varies by field and individual. Assess your own needs and understand your advisor’s expectations for frequency of communication (in person and via email).Does your advisor like to provide guidance each step of the way so that he or she is aware of the details of everything you are doing?Does your advisor want you to launch your work more independently and report back at pre-determined or regular intervals?What do you need to be productive? Are you ready to work more independently?Be proactive in seeking information. Explicitly ask how often your advisor usually meets with new students and how the advisor prefers to be updated on your progress in between meetings. Ask your peers how frequently they meet with their advisor and whether this has changed over time.There will be disciplinary differences in meeting frequency.In humanities and in some social sciences, where library, archive, and field research take students away from campus, maintaining regular communication is essential, including through scheduled meetings whether in-person or virtual.In life sciences and physical sciences and engineering, students often see their advisors daily in the lab or meet as a research group about externally funded projects; these regular check-ins and conversations may replace formal meetings. Make sure that you are also scheduling one-on-one times to talk about your broader goals and academic and career planning progress, however.Some of your decisions about meeting frequency will be informed by talking to others, but much of it you learn through experience working together with your advisor. Even this will change over time as you become a more independent researcher and scholar. Communicate with your advisor regularly about your changing needs and expectations at each stage of your graduate career.Resolving ConflictIn any relationship, there can be conflict. And, in the advisor-advisee relationship, the power dynamic created by the supervision, evaluation, and, in some cases, funding role of your advisor can make conflicts with your advisor seem especially high.You have options, however, including:Reviewing the Cornell and Graduate School polices. They provide clear expectations, help you manage problems when they occur, and protect you from retribution when trying to address these problems. Examples of these policies include:Code of Legislation of the Graduate FacultyCampus Code of ConductPolicy on Academic MisconductResearch MisconductGraduate School Grievance PolicyIntellectual Property policiesTalking with your advisor to clarify any miscommunication. Cornell University’s Office of the Ombudsman, one of the offices on campus that offers confidentiality, can also assist you by talking through the issue and helping you gather information you need before you speak directly with your advisor.Speaking with someone in the Graduate School, either the Associate Dean for Academics (gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu or jem522@cornell.edu) for academic issues, or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life (janna.lamey@cornell.edu) for other issues. These deans will listen, offer advice and support, and can also rehearse with you any conversation you might want to have with your advisor. They can also contact your advisor, if you want them to do so.Touching base with your program director – if this person is not also your advisor –to talk to about policies and possible solutions to the conflict.Soliciting peer advice. Discuss strategies for managing and resolving conflict with your advisor. “Do you have any suggestions for me?” “Have you ever had an issue like this…?” can be effective questions.Identifying a new advisor if the conflict can not be resolved. Your program director can help with this, and the Graduate School (as above) can help as well.Changing AdvisorsOn occasion, students find that they need or want to change their advisor. An advisor can resign as the student’s special committee chair/faculty advisor. The Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty describes the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty in each of these situations.Typical reasons to seek a new advisor include:Research interests that veer from the faculty’s expertise or ability to fund a certain projectYour advisor retires or resigns from the university or takes an extended leave of absence for personal or professional reasonsDifferences in goals, values, or an approach to work or communication style that can’t be resolvedSerious issues, involving suspected inappropriate behavior, questionable research conduct, or alleged bias, discrimination, or harassmentIf you are considering changing advisors:Talk to your program director or someone in the Graduate School about the proposed change. Some issues, such as funding, require timely attention.Identify other faculty members who could serve as your advisor, then meet with one or more of them. The goal is to decide together if you are a good fit with their program. Tips: Discuss or rehearse this conversation with a trusted person, especially if there were issues with your last advisor. Be transparent about these issues and address them going forward with a new advisor. Often prospective advisors are more willing to take on a new graduate student who conveys genuine enthusiasm for their area of study rather than a student who seems to be looking for a way out of a current advising relationship that has gone sour.Consider how and when to inform your advisor if you plan to change advisors. Be professional and respectful. Thank your advisor for past support and guidance. Don’t damage, or further damage, the relationship.Faculty may have professional relationships with each other and in some cases personal relationships. Consider how such relationships may influence your choices in changing advisors and consider asking the following people to help you navigate complicated situations.Your program director, if appropriateOffice of the University OmbudsmanGraduate School’s Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life (janna.lamey@cornell.edu)Graduate School’s Associate Dean for Academics (gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu)Challenges and Potential SolutionsAll good relationships take work. To navigate an advising relationship successfully over time, you should familiarize yourself with some common challenges and possible actions to take.Challenge: Mismatch in communication needs or styleOne example of a communication challenge in an advising relationship is when you want input along the way during a writing project, but you have an advisor who prefers to wait to comment on a complete written draft.Some possible steps to address this might be to talk to peers about they have handled this in their relationship with their advisor or to explain to your advisor how his or her input at this earlier stage will help speed you along toward having a complete draft for review. It’s important in communicating with your advisor to show that you understand what alternative they are proposing and why (e.g., “I understand that …”).Challenge: Advisor unavailable or awayYour advisor might be away from campus for a semester or more to conduct research or take a sabbatical leave. Or when a grant proposal deadline or report is looming, your advisor might be less available. Maybe you’ve emailed your advisor several times with no response.Planning and stating in advance what you need, such as feedback on a manuscript draft or signatures on a fellowship application, can help your advisor anticipate when you will have time-sensitive requests. Making plans in advance to communicate by email or video conference when either of you will be away from campus for a longer period of time is another useful strategy. Your director of graduate studies (DGS) and other faculty who serve as special committee members can also provide advice when your advisor is unavailable.Challenge: Misaligned expectationsYou are ready to submit a paper or project. Your advisor says it needs much more work. Or you begin your job search, applying for jobs in government or the non-profit sector, but your advisor insists that you should apply for industry jobs or graduate school instead.Discussing your needs and expectations early, and often, in the advising relationship is essential. Get comfortable, and skilled, advocating for yourself with your advisor. Use the annual Student Progress Review as an opportunity to communicate your professional interests and goals with your advisor. Use multiple mentors beyond your advisor to get advice and expertise on topics where you need a different perspective or support.Sometimes challenges can become opportunities for you to develop and refine new skills in communication, negotiation, self-advocacy, and management of conflict, time, and resources. For example, although you might feel abandoned if your advisor is unavailable for a time, even this potentially negative experience could become an opportunity to learn how to advocate for yourself and communicate about your needs and perceived difficulties in the relationship.Funding for Professional Master’s StudentsThe funding available from Cornell, if any, will be described in your offer of admission letter.You can explore supplemental funding options on the Experience Cornell website.You should take stock of the total program cost and develop a realistic plan for funding your education in advance to minimize the risk of depleting funds midway through. If you do find yourself in a position where you can’t afford to continue it may be helpful to speak with your advisor about taking a leave while saving up or seeking external funding options or loans.In very rare cases, professional students may be given the opportunity to serve as a TA and receive both a stipend and tuition credit (but this is not common.)Of course, it’s always important to carefully consider the value of your education relative to your career plans. Avoid taking on debt that will be disproportionate to the salary projections in your chosen career field.ResourcesOn CampusGraduate School deans and directors are available to answer academic and non-academic questions and provide referrals to useful resources.Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) staff offer confidential, professional support for students seeking help with stress, anxiety, depression, grief, adjustment challenges, relationship difficulties, questions about identity, and managing existing mental health conditions.Let’s Talk Drop-in Consultations are informal, confidential walk-in consultations at various locations around campus.External ResourcesUniversity of Michigan Rackham, How to Get the Mentoring You Want Laura Gail Lunsford & Vicki L.

Complete Graduate StudentBecoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion SeriesWeekly WalksBook ClubsStudent GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolAcademic ProgressFaculty Guides to Advising & Mentoring Research Degree StudentsFaculty Guides to Advising & Mentoring Research Degree StudentsGraduate students view effective advising, mentoring, and positive, productive relationships with faculty as important to their success in graduate school and on the job market.The importance of positive and productive faculty-graduate student relationships is supported by research literature on graduate student satisfaction, students’ publishing rates during graduate school, and degree completion support, as well as by the findings of Graduate School surveys of graduate students and alumni.Faculty Guide to Advising Research Degree StudentsAdvising and MentoringAdvising and mentoring are often used interchangeably, and faculty may serve in both roles for a student.Advisor ResponsibilitiesThe faculty advisor is responsible for guiding students in meeting the requirements and expectations of the graduate field and the Graduate School for the degree.Help students develop a plan and timeline to meet expectations and milestones for each step of the degree program, including requirements of the special committee, the graduate field, and the Graduate School, within an appropriate timeframe for the following:Required courseworkExams required by the graduate field or the Graduate SchoolEffective research proposals/prospectusResearch projectsThesis or dissertationAlong with the graduate student, completes the required annual Student Progress Review (SPR) on the timeline expected by the graduate field.Writes informed letters of recommendation for a student’s job or postdoc applications, often serving in this role for many years after a student graduates.Mentor ResponsibilitiesA faculty advisor who also serves as a faculty mentor provides support and guidance that extends beyond the scope of advising and may include any of the following:Communicates with their mentee about the mutual expectations for their mentoring relationshipsCo-constructs a mutual expectations agreement plan with their menteeDemystifies the structure, culture, and unstated expectations of graduate educationSupports their mentee in building out their professional and mentor network by purposefully introducing them to professional colleaguesSuggests opportunities for career exploration or job applicationsProvides nominations for award recognitions and letters of recommendation for the job marketActively advocates for mentees within the graduate program and in the broader academic or professional community beyond CornellMay serve as a role model and source of inspirationMay become a professional peer and potential collaborator, in the futureMentoring relationship may persist over timeSome faculty may serve as both an advisor and mentor to particular students, or only an advisor or only a mentor to other students.Faculty can encourage graduate students who they advise and/or mentor to cultivate a network of multiple mentors with varied expertise who will provide different functions based on changing needs as graduate students progress through their programs from new students to independent scholars and researchers.Creating a Culture of Belonging and RespectCornell students arrive here from across the world and represent a diversity of social identities, lived experiences, and academic interests. Advisors and mentors play a crucial role in helping students develop a sense of belonging and community within their degree programs, research groups, and the university more broadly.Advisors and mentors should not only be sensitive to, but also responsive to, the individual differences and experiences of graduate student advisees and mentees. Adopting culturally-aware advising and mentoring practices can help advisors and mentors become more sensitive and responsive to the individual differences and experiences of advisees and mentees.A Culturally Aware Advising and Mentoring ApproachA culturally aware approach to advising and mentoring requires advisors and mentors to develop an understanding of the lived experiences and social identities of graduate student advisees and mentees. This approach requires advisors and mentors to identify and recognize their own culturally shaped beliefs, perceptions, and judgments and to be cognizant of the cultural differences and similarities between themselves and their advisees and mentees. It also requires advisors and mentors to gain both intrapersonal and interpersonal cultural awareness and skills to recognize and respond to cultural diversity related issues that may arise in their advising and mentoring relationships.Become aware of implicit biases and how to mitigate themLearn how to have meaningful conversations about identity and difference with graduate student advisees and menteesBecome more familiar with the potential impact of social identity in challenging conversations, and to learn how to engage empathetically with conflicting perspectivesAvoid making assumptions about the lived experiences and social identities of students by listening and learning from students about their individual experiences and needsThis approach helps create an inclusive, supportive environment where graduate students have the opportunity to feel valued and respected for their individual experiences, differences, and contributions. Students feel a greater sense of belonging within their degree programs, while advisors and mentors better understand the unique backgrounds of their students, which can help inform their individualized advising and mentoring strategies.For more information, see Byars-Winston, Angela et al. “Pilot Study of an Intervention to Increase Cultural Awareness in Research Mentoring: Implications for Diversifying the Scientific Workforce.” Journal of clinical and translational science vol. 2,2 (2018): 86-94. doi:10.1017/cts.2018.25.ResourcesVisit the Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) website. Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER) Culturally Aware Mentoring ResourcesThe Intergroup Dialogue Project, in collaboration with the Graduate School, provides annual sessions, Intergroup Dialogue Skills in an Academic Context: Engaging in Challenging Conversations Across Difference, to help advisors and mentors practice tools for communicating across difference and to equip advisors and mentors to employ the LARA (listen, affirm, respond, and add) method within their advising and mentoring practices.Visit the Graduate School’s Implicit Bias Resources page to access tools to help understand and mitigate implicit bias.Visit the Graduate School’s Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement Faculty Resources page to access a recording of  Sweeney Windchief’s talk on Culturally Attuned Mentoring Paradigms – Relationships in Community Context.Visit the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity page of Resources to Engage in Conversations About Race and Anti-Racism.See Inside Higher Ed, Sathy, V., Hogan, K. A., & Sims, C. M. (2020, July 1). A Dozen Plus Ways You Can Foster Educational Equity. Inside Higher Ed.Advising New StudentsThe transition to graduate school for new students, and the transition to Cornell for those who may have completed some or all of a graduate degree program elsewhere, can be both an exciting and challenging time.Location, climate, culture, requirements, and expectations may be new and difficult to navigate. Even the logistics and routines that become commonplace after a short time, such as those involving housing, transportation, weather, nutrition, and wellness, might be overwhelming during the first few weeks and months.Tips and ResourcesEffective advising and mentoring includes knowing about and referring students to the resources they need to help manage these challenges.Graduate student handbooks, available in most fields, describe the graduate field degree requirements, the field’s expectations related to successful study and research, and the resources available to students.Peer mentoring programs, available in some graduate fields, pair new students with current students to help acclimate them to graduate study at Cornell.Encourage new students to attend the Graduate Student Orientation.The Navigating Graduate School page on the Graduate School website lists resources to help admitted and arriving students.Encourage students to use the Graduate School and other campus resources throughout their time pursuing a Cornell degree.Advising International StudentsInternational students comprise nearly half of all Graduate School students. With varying levels of English language fluency and experience with the American system of higher education, international students may need additional resources or information to acclimate.ResourcesThe Graduate School’s FAQ for International Students provides the following information:Required Admission Supplement for International StudentsFinancial CertificationVisas: Special TopicsNetIDsCertiFileSummer Program for English and Culture (SPEAC) The English Language Support Office (ELSO)The Office of Global LearningOrientation for international graduate and professional studentsVisa counselingTax and employment adviceOther supports for international students The Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI)International Teaching Assistant Language AssessmentInternational Teaching Assistant (ITA) Summer Training ProgramInternational Teaching Assistant Program (ITAP) Advising First Generation and Students from Historically Underrepresented BackgroundsStudents who identify with one or more identities historically underrepresented in graduate education – racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, disability, first generation college students, veterans – are more likely to find themselves as being the only or one of few from their social identity groups. Consequently, positive and productive advising and mentoring relationships are especially important to supporting their progression, academic and professional development, and success.About a third of doctoral recipients identify as first generation college students whose parents do not have a college degree. Though first generation students are represented across all demographic groups, they are more likely to identify with other backgrounds historically underrepresented in the academy. They are also more likely to be from lower to modest socioeconomic backgrounds, potentially making it difficult to cover costs associated with some social and professional activities such as research conferences.Tip: Making formal and informal professionalization and socialization activities more accessible to all advisees and mentees can help mitigate these challenges.First generation and other students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in graduate education that did not have access to certain mentoring experiences may lack insights on the sociocultural norms, systems, structures, and unwritten rules of academia, potentially negatively impacting their academic acculturation and successful progression through their graduate studies. This lack of critical knowledge, which can be learned, has the potential to negatively impact their academic acculturation and successful progression through their graduate studies.Tip: Demystifying the unwritten rules, language, and norms of graduate education especially within the context of a specific graduate field can help mitigate these challenges.Advisors and mentors play a critical role in helping students identify resources within and beyond their graduate programs to support their development of a sense of belonging and community at Cornell. Regardless of a student’s background, it is essential for advisors and mentors not to make assumptions or generalizations about students based on any aspect of their social identities or lived experiences.Tip: Expressing interest in students as whole individuals, listening to what they choose to share about their experiences, and asking about their specific interests and needs help advisors and mentors make informed suggestions on which opportunities and resources might best meet the academic and professional development needs of advisees and mentees.For more information, visit the Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) website or contact the Graduate School Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement.Advising Students with FamiliesAbout 30% of Cornell’s graduate and professional students have a spouse or partner; almost 10% have one or more children. Many also have responsibility, financial or otherwise, for other family members. These students manage their time, work, and finances with a focus on their family and may ask for advice or share their challenges with faculty who provide a more supportive climate.Tips and ResourcesAct as a role model for work-life balance.Communicate and support flexibility in your students’ schedules, particularly around personal and holiday time.Refer students to the Cornell resources that support students with families, such as student-parent dependent care grants, the Cornell Child Care Center, health insurance for dependents, medical care for children, and the lactation rooms.Become familiar with the Students with Families website, which includes policy updates, special events, and resources for students’ spouses/partners and children.Developing Effective Advising RelationshipsEffective (and efficient) advising relationships begin by discussing expectations early on. Transparency about expectations and timely communication are two essential factors associated with good advising and mentoring that graduate students often mention. Cornell graduate students also note the importance of faculty approachability, support, honest and regular feedback, and a recognition that both advisor and advisee and mentor and mentee can benefit from strong, positive relationships.Developing a shared understanding of expectationsA shared understanding of mutual expectations within an advising or mentoring relationship begins at the first meeting and is continually refined over time. Covering topics, like the ones listed below, will allow both of you to discuss and align expectations.Ask students about the areas where they might need support: writing, teaching, research, professional networking, etc.Discuss goals, work style preferences, and communication style – and the degree to which these are in alignment (or the degree to which flexibility and adaptation will be needed).Suggest areas where the advisor can help based on strengths, skills, knowledge, and availability.Consider other faculty and administrators who can provide support or mentoring beyond the advisor’s own expertise and/or availability.Be aware of campus resources and refer students to those resources freely and without judgement.Talk about logistics including frequency of in-person meetings and progress updates by email.Begin to make plans and set deadlines for meeting degree requirements, such as Q and A exams.Discuss funding plans.Discuss needs and expectations for presenting and publishing research, especially in fields where collaborative research and co-authorship are common.Encourage students to look for information and advice from across campus.Encourage students to develop a network of mentors.Tips for Sensitive ConversationsOften, students are not comfortable speaking with their advisor about weaknesses and challenges. Sometimes it helps to refer a student to the Graduate School or another campus office.Example:“Most students experience stress at some point in graduate school. They find that the deans in the Graduate School are helpful with talking about a range of difficulties, finding community, or resolving problems…even challenges with their advisor!”“I often suggest to students that they talk to someone at Cornell Health about…motivation, procrastination, anxiety about writing, feelings of isolation, etc.”Advising for Degree Progression and CompletionEffective advisors help their students understand and meet degree and other expectations for successful completion of their program.Tips and ResourcesMake degree requirements readily available, preferably as part of the graduate field’s online graduate student handbook.Provide students with additional requirement details pertinent to their individual needs or plans.Provide students with the unwritten rules to academic success.The expected quality of workThe importance of meeting deadlinesExpectation for establishing professional and social networks in graduate school and in the disciplineEncouragement for attending conferences and making presentations, presenting posters and papers, writing for publication, securing funding, preparing early for the job market, etc.Provide students with important information specific to your discipline, for example: the length of time it might take to get required approvals to conduct research projects (e.g., from animal care or human participant review boards) and how to continue productivity while waiting for approval, getting timely feedback from faculty on drafts of proposals or dissertation chapters, or how to strategically engage each member of a special committee for greater support and efficiency.Providing Feedback on Academic PerformanceRegular and candid communications about academic progress can help a student be more productive, efficient, and confident that they are moving in an advisor-approved and supported direction for degree completion.  TipsAsk students to develop an academic and research plan that includes dates for accomplishing each requirement, including:Course requirementsSpecial committee formationFellowship applications and feedbackField and Graduate School examsProposal or prospectusResearch and publicationsThesis or dissertationConsider asking students to use a planning tool like the Individual Development Plan (IDP) in which students outline their academic, research, and professional development plans.Revisit student plans, at least annually, as part of the required Student Progress Review.Review and assess progressRecognize accomplishmentsIdentify obstaclesPromptly discuss problems and help provide options for addressing them.Supporting Student Well-beingMental health and well-being are the foundation for academic and life success.Not all stress is problematic. Some stress can increase students’ functioning, and overcoming challenges is an important part of developing resilience; however, extreme psychological distress can undermine a student’s ability to persist and impact degree completion.  Nationally, graduate students report higher levels of depression or anxiety compared to the general population. This is true for Cornell graduate students as well. According to the Cornell Doctoral Experience Surveys (2019 and 2021), over half of Cornell Ph.D. degree students have reported mental health concerns as being a major or minor obstacle to their academic success.Effective advisors actively create and promote a culture of well-being.TipsExpectations and feedbackProvide clear expectations, timeline and assessment criteria. Motivate through positive rather than negative reinforcement.Belonging and social connectednessGet to know your students personally, professionally, and academically. Encourage your students to get to know each other. A sense of academic and social belonging improves self-efficacy, mental health, productivity, and satisfaction.Growth mindset and motivationDemonstrate and communicate a belief in a student’s ability to grow by acquiring new knowledge and skills. Provide honest feedback that encourages self-reflection and steady progress forward. Normalize failure and help-seeking behaviors as part of the process of learning.Meaning and purposeEncourage self-reflection practices that allow students to gain greater self-awareness. Share your own professional journey. Support student career exploration (within and beyond academia) and preparation.Stress management and self-careValidate the importance of rest and self-care in relation to academic performance, mental health, and well-being. Endorse the practice of taking meaningful breaks and actively managing stress.Addressing Concerns about StudentsAt times you may have concerns about your students’ well-being and may be unsure what to do. Cornell has resources for you to engage with to support the student’s well-being. Concerns:Safety: Cornell University Police: 607-255-1111.Students in crises: Student Support and Advocacy Services in the office of the Dean of Students focus areas include campus-wide case management and crisis response services. Case management consists of building 1-on-1 helping relationships with students while coaching them toward resources, self-care, and self-advocacy. Students experiencing non-crisis physical, psychological, safety, and patterns of academic concern should be referred to this office via this form by selecting the Student of Concern in the Report Type drop-down menu. To reach the Administrator on-Call after-hours, call the Cornell University Dispatch at 607-255-1111 and request to be connected to the Administrator on-Call. Students in distress: Cornell Health Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) counselors are available to assist faculty and staff members regarding students in distress. Contact them at 607-255-5155. During business hours, press 1 for urgent concerns or 2 to be connected with a CAPS receptionist. When Cornell Health is closed, your call will be answered by the answering service, and an on-call health care provider will return your call within 30 minutes.Advice:The Graduate School Office of Graduate Student Life can help determine how best to support academic and student life concerns. We can help brainstorm strategies to support difficult situations, discuss next steps, connect with other campus resources, and make action plans. Your director of graduate studies is a great resource if you are concerned about the well-being of your student and is often aware of other resources or strategies to best support you and your student.Disabilities or accommodations: If your student is asking for academic flexibility because of a particular concern (i.e. medical, disability, or experience), refer the student to the Student Disability Services (SDS) Office. SDS will make sure that the institution has fulfilled all legal obligations and provides structure and a process to support both advisor and student in negotiating what is an appropriate accommodation.There may be times that your student will be best supported through other Cornell offices; please become familiar with other available resources.Guiding Students' Professional and Career DevelopmentStudents engage in professional development opportunities and begin career exploration at varying times. Perceptions about the job market both within and beyond academia can create considerable concern and anxiety, while exploring and preparing for a variety of career options can foster confidence and competence.TipsEncourage students to utilize the services and engage in the events and programs provided by the Career & Professional Development team within the Graduate School. Provide encouragement and guidance as your students prepare to enter the job market.Refer students to resources available on campus, recognizing that advisors may not have direct experience with a specific type of job.Refer students to designated faculty or career professionals in your field.Encourage students to attend professional meetings of regional groups or organizations.Assist students with preparing application materials for appropriate funding opportunities.ResourcesPathways to Success, the Graduate School’s professional development framework for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, is designed to support student success now and into their future careers.

Communicating in person is often the best way to foster a positive and effective relationship.If you need to communicate by email, consider the following tips:All emails, faculty and student, should be responded to in a timely manner and within two weeks.For emails requiring a more rapid response, indicate the date by which you need a response.If students do not respond, consider appropriate next steps to determine if the student is alright or if there are problems that require other resources.Consequences for non-responsive students should be discussed with the DGS and can include a notification that funding will be withdrawn or the advisor will resign.Special Challenge: Resolving ConflictConflict can be present in any relationship. The power dynamic created by the advisor’s supervision, evaluation, and funding roles can make students hesitant to address differences in opinion or approaches. The stakes can feel too high and the outcome too fraught with fear of losing funding or an advisor.Tips and resourcesReview Cornell and Graduate School policies that can help prevent and manage problems. Examples of these policies include the following:Graduate Faculty’s Code of LegislationStudent Code of ConductPolicy on Academic MisconductResearch MisconductGraduate School Grievance PolicyIntellectual PropertyGraduate Student Assistantships (Policy 1.3)Communicate regularly and work to clarify any miscommunication.Talk to the field director of graduate studies (DGS) who can suggest a resolution and also facilitate a conversation with both parties present.Consult the Office of the University Ombuds.These Graduate School deans can assist faculty and students, individually or together, in developing strategies to resolve conflict. They can also refer advisors and students to a trained conflict resolution consultant on campus. Contacts:Associate Dean for Academics, gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.eduAssociate Dean for Inclusion and Student & Faculty Engagement, grad_assoc_dean@cornell.eduSenior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life, gradstudentlife@cornell.eduIf the conflict can’t be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, the advisor may choose to resign, or the student may choose to get a new advisor.Students can consult with the Graduate School Associate Dean for Academics or the Senior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Life about changing advisors. The Graduate School’s Code of Legislation provides detailed guidance on changes to special committee membership and committee member resignations.Challenge: Working with Students Who Want to Leave Graduate SchoolOn occasion a student with whom you are working will decide to leave Cornell for another graduate program or to leave graduate study altogether. These students may find it difficult to discuss their decision. They may believe that leaving a graduate program is a sign of failure or feel guilty that they are letting others, like their advisor, down.TipsDiscuss sound reasons for leaving constructively, for example, a poor fit or timing issues.Consider other personal or professional reasons, remembering that students often return for graduate study at Cornell or elsewhere.Consider whether the student will benefit from your advice, especially if there are areas in which the student truly needs to improve to be successful in graduate school.In cases where the student’s academic progress has been inadequate or where there has been conflict or unresolvable mismatch in communication or work styles between student and advisor, refer the student to the DGS or to someone in the Graduate School for this conversation and feedback. The Graduate School can help develop a supportive exit plan to the degree that is possible.(In situations where the student is leaving related to academic or research misconduct or academic integrity violations, the Graduate School will have been involved from the outset; please contact the Associate Dean for Academics if you have questions.)Special Challenge: Conflicts of InterestConflicts of interest can impact advising and result in inappropriate decisions affecting students. The focus should always be on what is in the student’s best interest.ExamplesRomantic, sexual, or personal relationships with the studentIntellectual conflicts of interest related to students’ freedom to publish research resulting from thesis and dissertation researchFinancial conflicts of interests related to outside professional activities, including those in the private sector on faculty-supported projectsThe American Association of University Professors (AAUP) cautions that a “conflict of interest does not entail an accusation of wrongdoing. … A conflict of interest refers to a factual circumstance wherein an impartial observer might reasonably infer that a conflict is present.”Faculty should enlist their department chair or others to help manage potential conflicts of interest.Advisors who want advice when considering whether a potential conflict of interest concerning a student exists, and whether such a conflict can be reasonably managed or should be avoided, can consult with their department chair, the Graduate School, Cornell’s Office of Policy, or the Office of the Vice Provost for Research, depending on the specific circumstance.Personal Relationships with Graduate Students and the Consensual Relationship PolicyCornell’s consensual relationship policy, Policy 6.3 (December 21, 2018) describes relationships that are prohibited as well as those that are not prohibited but that must be disclosed.Prohibited sexual or romantic relationships include (1) those where a member of the Cornell community has academic or professional authority over a student, (2) those between a faculty member and an undergraduate student, and (3) those where a faculty member holds a position of authority or is likely to do in the foreseeable future.The policy specifically addresses relationships with graduate and professional students this way:Because a graduate or professional student’s educational pursuits may evolve and that student may become academically aligned with a large number of faculty members or others who are affiliated with the same graduate field or degree program, the university discourages all intra-field/degree program relationships that are romantic or sexual in nature. When a romantic relationship develops under these circumstances that may not directly violate Provisions 1-3 above, it is nonetheless important that the faculty member or other person in authority promptly discloses the relationship to Academic HR Consensual Relationship Reporting (acadhr_reporting@cornell.edu).In addition, relationships that meet one or more of the following criteria must also be disclosed to Academic HR:Faculty in a position of authority over a student when the relationship existed prior to one or both parties coming to Cornell.Faculty in a position of authority where both parties are in the same graduate field or degree program (albeit without an academic or supervisory relationship).Faculty currently in a relationship that is in violation of the current policyFurther, the policy notes that “if clarification is desired regarding whether a relationship requires disclosure,” faculty should contact Academic HR Consensual Relationship Reporting (acadhr_reporting@cornell.edu).Internal and External Educational Resources & ToolsFaculty Advancing Inclusive MentoringCornell Graduate School Practical Steps for Addressing Inequities & Supporting BelongingCornell Graduate School Faculty Resources for Supporting Graduate Student Diversity, Inclusion, and Well-beingCornell University Office of Faculty Development and Diversity – Resources for Mentors and MenteesUniversity of Michigan, Rackham Graduate School – Faculty and Graduate Student Mentoring and Advising GuidesNational Academics – The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEMMNational Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD): Re-Thinking Mentoring: How to Build Communities of Inclusion, Support and Accountability (Focus is on mentoring faculty, but content can be adapted to be relevant to working with graduate students.)NCFDD: Creating a Harassment Free Lab NCFDD: How to Engage in Healthy Conflict (Focus is more on faculty to faculty interactions, but content can be adapted to be relevant to working with graduate students.)National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) Resources for Faculty MentorsClinical & Translational Science Institute: Online Mentor Training Modules (These modules are currently available at no charge to people affiliated with the University of Minnesota and external users who create a guest account with the university.) Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER) – Mentor Curricula and Training: Entering Mentoring University of Minnesota Mentoring Modules – External Registration GuideDuke University – Graduate School Mentor ToolkitUniversity of Colorado Boulder – Graduate School Advising AgreementNature – The Key to a Happy Life is in the ManualFaculty Advancing Inclusive Mentorship: FAIMFaculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) is an equity-based systemic change initiative that provides a framework for inclusive mentorship applicable across graduate education and the professoriate.

ProgramsGraduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop SeriesPerspectives: The Complete Graduate StudentBecoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion SeriesWeekly WalksBook ClubsStudent GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolAcademic ProgressGuidelines for Graduate Field Academic HandbooksGuidelines for Graduate Field Academic HandbooksExecutive SummaryGraduate fields develop and disseminate academic handbooks to support their graduate students’ academic progress and to harmonize students’ and faculty expectations by providing clarity on core requirements. Online handbooks are effective recruiting tools, as they provide prospective students with information about the program’s degree requirements, funding, and resources available to support students once admitted.The information below is designed to help fields develop a new – or update an existing – graduate field academic handbook, especially for doctoral students. These suggestions can be adapted as needed for research master’s degree students and professional degree students.AccessibilityPer Cornell’s federal reporting requirements, field handbooks are required to be made available online. We encourage that fields present these as well-organized and accessible webpages or as an accessible, downloadable document.PurposeField handbooks help the graduate community…Identify and understand essential information about the core requirements for student degree completion,differentiate among and understand requirements of the Graduate School, the field, and the special committee and chair,understand the normative timeline for completing field and Graduate School milestones,identify academic and professional development and other opportunities to support students at different stages during their degree program, and, importantly,clearly identify all the academic expectations that the field and faculty have for students so that there are no unknown or unwritten expectations.Additional InformationAny additional information (such as lab manuals, student life information, building security and keys, facilities, field trips, graduate student organizations, journal clubs, photocopying, supplies, etc.) should be included elsewhere or at the bottom of the handbook via links. Additionally, please link to the Graduate School policies page rather than copying and pasting text from the Code of Legislation.Handbook ComponentsAcademic field handbooks are most easily understood when presented to students in chronological order so that students can understand the progression of their program and the required milestones to achieve each stage.Handbooks vary by field in content and scope; the checklist below includes components relevant to most degree programs. It includes suggested language and key questions that should be answered by each section.Fields that offer multiple degrees should ensure that the handbook makes clear distinctions between the different degree types (e.g., professional master’s, research master’s, doctoral) and that the handbook is divided appropriately based on this. Each degree should provide learning outcomes, field exam information, milestones, etc. Alternatively, a separate handbook can be provided for each degree.1. Program OverviewInclude a general description of the graduate program, required registration, residency on campus, degrees, links to further information, and program recognitions or achievements, including program timeline and average time to degree.2. Student Learning OutcomesList the intended program-level learning outcomes identified by the field faculty (these should match what is posted for the degree on the Graduate School Fields of Study page). The outcomes should articulate what students are expected to know, and be able to do, upon completion of the degree.Describe any core competencies, language requirements, or learning goals.Describe how students’ achievement of the intended outcomes will be assessed (e.g., milestone exams; major papers, presentations, and projects; evaluation by the special committee).3. CoursesInclude all required core courses and any required electives. Some fields have no required courses but, instead, allow the student’s special committee to advise the student on coursework. If that is the case, that should be explicitly described. Handbooks should describe the field’s policies on the following:Courses required by the department, if any. Are substitutions allowed? Is there a process for exempting students who have taken comparable courses at other institutions? What courses need to be taken and by when? What are the minimum number of credit hours required?Are required courses decided by the committee? Any process for how coursework requirements are decided should be clearly articulated.If the special committee advises on required courses, who helps the student choose their courses during their first three semesters prior to having a full committee (the DGS, a first-year advisor, etc.)? Articulate a process for how this works in your field.Minimum grades or GPA – Because Cornell’s Satisfactory Academic Progress policy stipulates that students in research degrees must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.25 to be in good academic standing or to be eligible for federal loans, it is required that a MINIMUM GPA of 2.25 be set.Incomplete (INC) grades – What are the expectations for students to complete INC grades? The Graduate School does not allow the grade to be changed after one year. Additionally, fields and instructors can set more strict deadlines if they wish. It’s often best to require INC grades to be resolved within a few weeks before students are busy with the following semester’s courses or research.Audits – Does the field have a policy on audited courses? What can be audited, taken as satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U), and what has to be taken for a grade?How are grades determined to be satisfactory? What happens to a student when they do not perform well in a class? Provide clarity as to what constitutes “good academic standing” and “satisfactory progress.”4. Special CommitteesPer the Code of Legislation, the Graduate Faculty requires both research master’s and doctoral students to have identified (or been assigned) a special committee chair or a temporary advisor no later than three weeks after the first registration in the Graduate School (submitted to the Graduate School via Student Center).Additionally, per the Code, the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students to have a full special committee no later than the end of the second semester and no later than the end of the third semester for doctoral students. The Code includes specific exceptions for graduate students in economics and physics (Code VI.B.6.).In this section, describe the field’s requirements for special committees. Are the committee requirements explicit and clearly explained for your field?Do students already have an advisor identified at the time of admissions, are they assigned a temporary chair upon matriculation, or will they need to identify an advisor in their first weeks?Are rotations expected? If so, how are they structured?When should a student form a full committee?Do special committee members have to represent specific areas of expertise, required by the department or by the special committee?How many members are required by the field? (The Code of Legislation requires at least three.)What is the process if a student has difficulty identifying an advisor? Is funding linked to having an advisor by a certain deadline?Should the chair or a committee member resign, what is the replacement process for students? (This can be a link to relevant sources.) Specifically, what is the process for students to find a new chair/replace committee members, and what are the time constraints to still be in good standing?5. Student Progress ReviewThe Student Progress Review (SPR) supports regular communication including written feedback between students and their advisors, requiring research degree students and their special committee to have at least one formal conversation each year about academic progress, accomplishments, and plans. Students complete a form describing milestones completed, accomplishments, challenges, and plans. The special committee chair responds in writing and indicates whether the student’s progress is excellent, satisfactory, needs improvement, or is unsatisfactory. Describe when students are generally expected to complete the SPR each year. Are first-year students asked to fill out a SPR?Reinforce that the SPR should identify the student and advisor’s plans for upcoming academic deliverables, milestones, expectations, and deadlines.6. Field ExamsAll required field exams, such as concentration, Q, A, and B exams, should be clearly articulated regarding timing, the exam requirements, deadlines for completing exams, exam outcomes, retakes, and consequences for each outcome, including pathways for dismissal from the program.Q ExamsSome fields have a qualifying exam (Q exam), or concentration exams, required in the first or second year of doctoral study designed to determine students’ ability to pursue doctoral studies. Although requirements for Q exams vary widely by field, students who pass the Q exam continue in their doctoral studies (Code F.3.). The handbook should articulate how the exam is structured and what types of content may be included. Most importantly, there should be clear information conveyed on the possible outcomes of the exam. This section should answer:Who determines the outcome?Is a field-appointed member required?When and how will results be communicated?What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken?Are conditional passes possible?If a student may be dismissed for failing a Q exam are there any circumstances where the student may earn a master’s degree?What is the pathway for dismissal?A ExamTo advance to doctoral candidacy, doctoral programs are required by the Graduate Faculty Code of Legislation to have an A exam, which can be completed after two semesters of registration and must be completed before the start of the seventh semester (Code F.1.c.). Some fields require completion sooner. This examination has varying formats (oral, written and oral, etc.) depending on whether its requirements are set by the field or by the special committee. The exam itself must be scheduled with the Graduate School, and announced to the field, no less than one week before the exam, though students should be aware they will need to schedule the date with their committee members far in advance of that deadline. The passing of this exam certifies that the student is eligible to present a dissertation to the Graduate Faculty. This section should answer:What are the requirements of the exam and format? Is there a field or public component?Is a field-appointed member required?Who determines the outcome?When and how will results be communicated?What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken?Are conditional passes possible, and if so, what are the explicit steps to reach a successful outcome? Articulate what happens if the outcome is not successful.If a student has failed the A exam, is there a pathway to earn a master’s degree (thesis or non-thesis) and what is the pathway for dismissal? These questions should also be considered in advance of the A exam if an unsuccessful outcome is anticipated.Consider offering links to examples of previous A exams.B ExamIn addition, all doctoral students take a final examination (the B exam, which is the oral defense of the dissertation) upon completion of all requirements for the degree, no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration requirement (Code F.1.d.). This section should remind students that a complete draft of their thesis or dissertation must be submitted to all members of their special committee six weeks prior to the B exam, and a final draft is due to all members five business days before the exam. The B exam should not be scheduled until the dissertation is complete and in final format. Further, the B exam must be scheduled with the Graduate School, and announced to the field, no less than one week before the exam. Please remind students they will need to schedule the date with their committee members far in advance of that deadline.This section should further answer:Who determines the outcome?When and how will results be communicated, including any required revisions?What happens if the exam is not passed? Can the exam be retaken?Are conditional passes possible, and if so, what are the explicit steps to reach a successful outcome? Articulate what happens if the outcome is not successful.If a student has failed the B exam, is there a pathway to earn a master’s degree and what is the pathway for dismissal?Additionally, the final thesis or dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School no later than 60 days after the B exam. Enrollment in future terms is not permitted after a passed B exam.Master’s StudentsPer the Code of Legislation, the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students writing a thesis to take a final examination upon completion of all degree requirements, no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration requirement (Code F.1.a.).Per the Code of Legislation, the Graduate Faculty requires research master’s students doing a research project report (in lieu of a thesis) to take a final examination at an appropriate time determined by the degree program. The exam may be oral or written to assess individual accomplishment of degree objectives (Code F.1.b.).The field should clarify if they allow the exam to be oral or written or if they have a more standardized approach (combination)For professional master’s students, please list any required final examinations in this section.7. Dissertation and ThesisIn general, a thesis or dissertation is required in the student’s major area of study (though a minor area can be allowed with approval) and under the supervision of the chair of their special committee. Doctoral students are required to submit a dissertation that is deemed acceptable in the scholarship and literary quality of their field. M.A. and M.S. students are required to submit a thesis or research project report that is appropriate to their program (exceptions to this include doctoral students receiving a non-thesis master’s.) Acceptance of the thesis or dissertation requires the approval of all the special committee members. This section should also address:Whether the special committee or field allows a paper option. If so, are there any requirements or expectations for publishing?Any additional requirements about the length or number of chapters, format, or content.8. Setting Mutual Expectations for MentoringCornell supports the Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring (FAIM) framework for faculty/student mentoring that draws upon a strengths-based and identity-informed approach to support mutual growth, development, and success (NASEM, 2019; Windchief, 2019).The FAIM philosophy, key principles, and core mutual expectation areas for inclusive mentorship provide a foundation for fulfilling mentoring relationships by:supporting mentors and mentees as they seek to develop an understanding of one another’s expectations, cultures, values, and sources of motivation;helping mentors and mentees develop a mentorship plan better aligned to a mentor’s and mentee’s strengths, needs, and goals; andproviding resources and tools that can be adapted and adopted by mentors and mentees to be contextually relevant.Please direct your students to the FAIM website, for resources and tools to support their mentoring relationships. Remind students to work with the graduate field administrator (GFA), who can serve as a liaison between faculty and students, and the director of graduate studies (DGS) in their department who can both provide advice and help navigate mentoring challenges.9. Required TrainingSome fields require training or courses related to safety and other topics in addition to university-required training on research with human subjects, animal care and use, etc. Describe these requirements relevant to the field’s students, including additional training required by the funding source and when and how students should complete the requirements. Per the Code of Legislation, the Graduate Faculty requires all research degree students, both master’s and doctoral, to complete responsible conduct of research (RCR) training. This includes training on authorship, peer review, and avoidance and consequences of research misconduct. This training is through the Cornell Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA) and must be completed before the end of the second semester (Code E.2.a.).10. Field- or Program-Specific Requirements and ResourcesIn this section, please include any additional field-specific academic requirements that are part of the academic program in your field.Examples of items that might be included:Teaching assignmentsShould provide clarity as to:Is teaching or teaching assistant (TA) service an academic requirement?What are the minimum number of semesters of teaching required?Is it stated in academic terms and included in the field’s published learning outcomes?Manuscript submissions and any requirements or expectations for publishingField awards and recognitionColloquia presentations, conference posters, or papersExternal fellowship applicationsIndividual Development Plans (IDPs)Minors/concentrations available to students in the fieldSummer progressTable or figure of program timeline and scheduleAny additional milestones or requirements for professional degrees that aren’t captured in the Graduate School milestones section 11. Field-based Professional DevelopmentSome fields have a seminar, series, or workshop to help students with writing a fellowship application, developing and writing the dissertation proposal/prospectus, the job search, and other topics. If these are required or strongly suggested in your field, please describe them in sufficient detail here.If your field expects or requires students to write grant or fellowship applications as part of either the academic requirements or funding plan, describe the deadline, criteria, and sign-off process.12. FundingDescribe methods for funding in the field, including fellowships, teaching assistantships, training grants, etc.; stipend payment schedule; requirements for receiving and maintaining specific types of funding; summer funding; expectations for writing and submitting external fellowship applications; and funding for travel, research, and conferences.Indicate that doctoral students will remain funded through the completion of the degree as long as they remain in good academic standing.For Sage fields, when is the Sage dissertation-writing fellowship typically used?Describe summer funding plans. If students are expected to secure external support, describe how funding is provided if they are unsuccessful.Are there field or departmental fellowships available? If so, is there an application process?How are teaching assistant assignments typically made?If students typically conduct field research while in absentia, describe how required funding is provided during this time. If the field limits the number of funded in absentia semesters, provide clear guidance to allow students to plan accordingly. Note that unfunded in absentia for field research is not permitted.Sample Field HandbooksThese Cornell graduate fields have graduate student handbooks that are useful as examples for their content, scope, and format.Biomedical engineeringNear Eastern studiesPlant biologyGraduate School ContactsFor assistance updating field handbooks or creating new content, please contact the Associate Dean for Academics Josephine Martell (gradacad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu or jem522@cornell.edu).

program. With the exception of some professional master’s degree programs, the Graduate School imposes no requirements for credits or courses. Research students have the freedom to shape a course of study that cuts across interrelated field offerings, while working within an academic framework developed with a Special Committee of faculty advisors chosen by the student.The Code of Legislation sets forth the rules governing graduate education as established by the graduate faculty of Cornell University. Students should familiarize themselves with the content of the Code and how it pertains to their programs. The complete Code is available for download.Getting StartedAfter enrolling at Cornell, all graduate and professional students must register each semester until they graduate with the exception of students who take leaves of absence or withdraw. Research students must select a Special Committee as well. Academic StructureEnrollment in Your ProgramEnrolling in CoursesFinding Administrative HelpAcademic RequirementsResearch students take an active role in defining their degree programs.  With few exceptions, there are minimal requirements for total credit hours or required courses.Making Academic ProgressNominating Your Special CommitteeAdvancing to Doctoral CandidacyDefending Your Thesis or DissertationTaking ExamsPetitioning for ExceptionsResponsible Conduct of ResearchEvery graduate student pursuing a research degree is required to complete training on Responsible Conduct of Research, addressing issues of authorship, peer review, plagiarism, and research misconduct.Responsible Conduct of ResearchStudent Progress ReviewThe annual Student Progress Review supports the regular exchange of constructive, written feedback between advisees and advisors.Student Progress ReviewManaging ChangeStudents may wish to change committees, fields, programs, or enrollment status.Changing Your CommitteeChanging Your Field or ProgramChanging Your StatusEducational Opportunities Off CampusCornell students may participate in an Exchange Scholar program with other universities and may register in absentia to conduct approved research or study 100 miles or more away from the Cornell campus while still under the guidance of their Special Committees.Educational Opportunities Off CampusIn Absentia                  Land AcknowledgementCornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ (the Cayuga Nation).

ProgramsGraduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop SeriesPerspectives: The Complete Graduate StudentBecoming a Resilient Scientist Discussion SeriesWeekly WalksBook ClubsStudent GovernanceStudent Perks and DiscountsGraduate SchoolFinancial SupportEmergency Fund ProgramEmergency Fund ProgramThe Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund Program assists Cornell graduate students experiencing urgent financial hardship due to unanticipated one-time expenses. This fund is intended to support the continued academic progress and well-being of students experiencing short-term financial hardship who cannot reasonably resolve their immediate financial needs through loans, aid programs, or personal resources. Only urgent needs and expenses incurred by the student directly will be considered.Grants of up to $500 are provided to help students offset necessary emergency expenses that cannot be funded by other means. Funding priority is based on the situation’s urgency, hardship level, and the student’s overall financial situation.Eligibility RequirementsStudents who can demonstrate need and are facing a current unexpected emergency may apply for this grant. Applicants must:Be enrolled for the semester at the time of the request. Students on a leave of absence are not eligible. Be enrolled in a degree program offered through Cornell’s Graduate School. This includes research degrees (M.A., M.S., or Ph.D.) and professional degrees administered through the Graduate School. If you are in an advanced-degree program that is administered outside of the Graduate School, you must seek emergency funding support through your college or school.Be in good academic standing with no current bursar holds.GuidelinesThe Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund was created to provide eligible students facing short-term, non-recurring emergencies with a one-time grant to alleviate the situation. Emergency funds are not intended to cover standard expenses included in the budgeted cost of attendance for the academic year (namely, tuition, fees, housing, and educational supplies); purchase of new technology or replacement of old technology; expenses incurred by someone other than the student; scholarly and professional conference attendance; fees and expenses related to post-graduation employment; costs associated with moving to or away from Ithaca; or loan repayment or credit card debt. In addition, it is not intended to provide financial support for the emergency expense in its entirety.Examples of Emergency SituationsExamples of emergencies to be considered include, but are not limited to:Change in family circumstancesFire/flood in living quartersHomelessness or sudden change in housing situationIllness/death in the familyMedical/dental emergenciesOverdue utility bills/turn-off noticeTheft of computers/books/clothing/other academic essentialsAllowable ExpensesAllowable expenses include but are not limited to:  Travel costs related to unexpected crisis or death in the familyTemporary housing for displacement due to fire, flood, or other unforeseen circumstancesReplacement of items due to theft or damageEmergency medical or emergency dental expenses not covered by insuranceOther unanticipated and urgent needs as appropriateImportant Application InformationGrants are awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis, and funds are limited.Students are only eligible for one award.The award does not require repayment.Expenses more than six months before the application date may not be covered.Grants may be taxable. The student is responsible for reporting the grant income and paying applicable taxes.Grant funds must be used for the purposes specified.Once your application has been received, decisions are typically made within seven business days. You will be notified of your application’s status at the end of that period and be informed of the next steps.Apply for the Graduate School Dean’s Emergency Fund.Other ResourcesDepending on your financial needs, some other programs administered outside of the Graduate School that may provide support include:Access Funds: This fund provides enrolled full-time undergraduate, graduate, and professional Cornell students with access to financial support, up to $500, to help mitigate on-campus barriers, access basic necessities, and cover emergency expenses not covered through financial aid or other university resources.CU Emergency Fund: The Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment (FASE) administers the CU Emergency Fund which assists currently enrolled students with urgent, unanticipated expenses. The fund is designed to assist with recent or upcoming emergency expenses that are above and beyond the standard cost of attendance. Costs such as technology, shipping, moving, or storage costs may be considered.Office of Global Learning Financial Emergency Support: Limited funding support may be available to international undergraduate, graduate, and professional students experiencing a health care or family emergency or unexpected expense.Food insecurity is a concern for many graduate students. A person who is food insecure has at times run out of money to buy food or run out of food before they could get more money. Additional support includes:Swipe Out Hunger Program: Cornell is a participant of the Swipe Out Hunger Program, through which students can request support or donate.Cornell Food Pantry: Cornell’s Food Pantry provides free, confidential access to food and personal care items to Cornell undergraduate and graduate students, as well as Cornell staff and faculty.For a complete listing of food resources available in Tompkins County, please consult with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County.ContactJanna LameySenior Assistant Dean for Graduate Student Lifejanna.lamey@cornell.edu607-255-5184                  Land AcknowledgementCornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ (the Cayuga Nation).

academic appointment in support of the teaching of a course of 15 to 20 hours per week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. The assignment is usually in the student's major field or a closely related one. TAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend.$33,930$11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated155GA - An academic appointment requiring 15 to 20 hours a week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. Graduate assistants receive full tuition credit and a stipend.$33,930$11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated155RA - An academic appointment for research that is not directly thesis-related, 15 to 20 hours per week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. RAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend.$33,930$11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately prorated155GRA - An academic appointment focused on thesis or other degree-related research of a type that is required from all candidates for the degree. Because a student devotes considerable time to dissertation research, the time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant. GRAs are awarded full tuition credit and a stipend.$33,930$11,310 for 13-week term or appropriately proratedA student’s time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant.8University Fellowship - An arrangement in which financial support is given to a graduate student to pursue his or her degree without any obligation on the part of the student to engage in teaching and/or research in furtherance of the university's academic mission. Generally, fellowships are merit-based awards.  Continued financial support is contingent upon the student maintaining satisfactory academic progress as defined by the graduate field and Graduate School.$33,930$7,148, if summer funding is offered with fellowshipN/A8Cornell Tech - Funded students located at the Cornell Tech campus generally receive a higher stipend linked to cost of living in the NYC area.$42,073TBATA/GA/RA - 15GRA - A student's time spent on research connected with the project is expected to be significant.TA/GA/RA - 5GRA/Fellowship - 8[1] Weekly hours spent on summer appointments must comply with University Policy 1.3, and stipend rates must meet the Board of Trustees mandated minimum (nine-month) stipend rate, prorated for the number of weeks of the summer appointment. The length of the summer appointment (number of weeks) is determined by the Principal Investigator, department, unit, college, or other source of funding.[2] The maximum academic-year stipend amount that a graduate student may receive when any portion of the stipend comes from any funds held at Cornell (university accounts, college accounts, department accounts, unit accounts, or Principal Investigator sponsored funds) is $52,026. The increase may be from the same funding source as the basic stipend (an “adjustment”) or from a different source (a “supplement”). The limit applies to support from any combination of fellowships or assistantships when part of the stipend is paid from funds held at Cornell. There is no restriction on summer stipends and fellowships.Prorated Stipends for Non-Standard AppointmentsMinimum stipend rates for non-standard appointments classified as graduate assistantships (TA, GA, RA, or GRA) must be proportional to the board-approved stipend. Examples are provided in the table below.Partial assistantships must include tuition proportional to the stipend. That is, if a student receives a partial TAship with 50% stipend for the semester, the hours must be limited to 7.5 or less per week and he or she must receive 50% tuition for that semester in addition to the stipend. Awards that do not provide tuition and stipend in amounts proportional to the hours expected of a regular assistant are not assistantships and should not be portrayed as such.Examples – Adjusted Stipend Rates for Non-Standard Appointments2024-25 Adjusted Stipend Rates for Non-standard AppointmentsDuration15 hours/week(Standard)7.5 hours20 hours(Maximum)One Semester$16,965.00$8,482.50$22,620.00Half-Semester$8,482.50$4,241.25$11,310.00One Month$3,770.00$1,885.00$5,026.67Summer (three months)$11,310.00$5,655.00$15,080.00Full Year (12 months)$45,240.00$22,620.00N/AAssistantships for Professional Degree StudentsStudents who are enrolled in professional degree programs are generally ineligible for assistantships outside of their graduate field of study, unless the director of graduate studies for the student’s program requests an exception based on the student gaining experience directly supporting the student’s ability to teach the subject matter of the profession. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by both the dean of the Graduate School and the dean of the college in which the professional degree program is housed. The college that administers the professional degree in which the student is enrolled is responsible for payment of the full tuition. Professional degree students may be appointed as graduate teaching/research specialists (GTRS) (see below). They may not accept an assistantship without:A signed letter from the director of graduate studies for the student’s program requesting an exception based on the student gaining experience directly supporting the student’s ability to teach the subject matter of the profession.A signed letter from the student’s college dean or dean’s designate indicating that the college will apply a tuition credit of at least $14,750 per semester.A signed letter from the Graduate School Dean or Associate Dean of Administration, approving the assistantship appointment.Graduate Teaching/Research Specialists Students in the professional degree programs may be appointed as graduate teaching/research specialists (GTRS). The GTRS is not an assistantship; GTRSs receive a stipend in proportion to the percent time of their appointment as compared to a full-time graduate assistantship but not tuition and health insurance. Hours are limited to no more than 10 per week. Before a program may begin using the GTRS title, approval must be given by the Graduate School.

Ninety-nine percent of Cornell’s Ph.D. students are fully funded to pursue their degrees through a combination of competitive internal and external fellowships and research and teaching assistantships. Funding packages include tuition, fees, health insurance, and a living allowance or stipend. Our base stipend rates for fellowships and assistantships are equivalent, consistent across graduate fields, and competitive with top other U.S. universities.Research master’s and professional degree programs at Cornell provide limited financial assistance. The terms of the awards may vary according to the program. For more information, please contact the individual professional program.Tuitions and CostsTuition varies with field and degree program.

assistant (TA), research assistant (RA), graduate assistant (GA), and graduate research assistant (GRA). These awards are administered by fields and departments. Assistantships are an arrangement in which financial support is given to a graduate student who engages in teaching and/or research in furtherance of the university’s academic mission, as well as his or her graduate education. Students on full assistantships receive the following:a stipend,a full tuition credit at the research degree rate, andCornell individual student health insurance.Some fields may supplement the stipend and/or make summer appointments.See also: University Policy on AssistantshipsApplyingAssistantships are awarded by departments, fields, and Principal Investigators. There is no separate application for assistantships. The assignment is usually in your major field or a closely-related one.Teaching Assistants (TAs)A teaching assistant is an academic appointment in support of the teaching of a course. Teaching assistants may assist in teaching a section of a course, lead discussions, and/or lead laboratory sections. Teaching assistants average no more than 15 hours per week for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees.   Special information for incoming international students: International students who come from countries where English is not the first language and who will TA in their first year at Cornell should visit the Center for Teaching Innovation’s International Teaching Assistant Program webpage for language assessment information.See also: On-Campus WorkSupport and resources for TAs: The Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) offers a central place where teaching assistants can go for insight and assistance with their teaching responsibilities, including programs and workshops for teaching assistants with all levels of experience. Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs)A GRA is an academic appointment focused on thesis or other degree-related research of a type that is required from all candidates for the degree. The research project for a GRA directly supports the student’s thesis or dissertation. Because a student devotes considerable time to thesis or dissertation research, the time spent is connected with the project.  Research Assistantships (RAs)A RA is an academic appointment for research that is not directly thesis-related, 15 to 20 hours per week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week. For example, a RA appointment might include data analysis on a faculty research project not directly related to the student’s dissertation topic. As with other assistantships, there is no separate application. Students are appointed by departments, fields, or individual faculty.Graduate Assistantships (GAs)A GA is an academic appointment requiring 15 to 20 hours a week, averaging no more than 15 hours per week, for the base stipend as established by the Board of Trustees. For example, a GA appointment might include assisting a faculty member in developing and coordinating an academic conference.                   Land AcknowledgementCornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ (the Cayuga Nation).

We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ people, past and present, to these lands and waters.\rThis land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ leadership.

Land AcknowledgementCornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫɁ are members of the Hodinǫ̱hsǫ́:nih Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land.

work across departments, disciplines, and colleges.As embodied in the graduate field structure, academic freedom is a foundational value for the Graduate School, which is a centralized unit, formally independent of the various colleges of the university.Fields of StudyAt Cornell, graduate study is organized using a field structure. Fields are composed of faculty members from a number of departments who come together around a shared intellectual interest, and may draw from different campuses or colleges.Our Fields of StudyUnderstanding the Field StructureFields of Study (PDF)Graduate DegreesThe Graduate School offers research and professional degrees in nearly 100 fields of study, with opportunities for further exploration in 18 minor (non-degree granting) fields.Our Degree ProgramsIn addition, Cornell offers these graduate degrees administered by colleges other than the Graduate School.Research and ScholarshipWith nearly $700 million in research expenditures, one of the 10 largest academic research libraries, top ranked graduate fields, and some of the best facilities in academia, Cornell University is consistently ranked as one of the most comprehensive universities in the world.Research HighlightsFacultyProgram Metrics, Assessments, and OutcomesWhy should you consider Cornell?
