WN24: From Zero Towards One: Turn Ideas into Technologies and Products That Matter Course No: EECS 498-014/EECS 598-013 Credit Hours: 4 credits Instructor: Krisztian Flautner Prerequisites: EECS 281 “First comes thought; then organization of that thought, into ideas and plans; then transformation of those plans into reality. The beginning, as you will observe, is in your imagination.” – wrote Napoleon Hill, an entrepreneur, author of self-help books, and a conman, in the early 20th century. His point was that innovation requires a certain action-oriented but critical mindset for success and that starting on that journey can often be the hardest part. Whether trying to innovate inside an organization, working on an open source project, or attempting to get a startup off the ground, the tools and techniques discussed in this class will be applicable to increase the chances of success. Students will be expected to propose and critically evaluate project ideas, form groups, and execute autonomously to achieve objectives. The groups will report directly to the “general manager” (faculty), with biweekly project meetings.

Being an IA affords you the opportunity to help fellow students and build a community at CSE. You don’t need to have mastered the material in order to be an IA; in fact, being an IA will help you understand the material even better. As an IA, you can contribute to building a climate of collaboration at CSE and contribute to the teaching mission. Additionally, you’ll be able to build relationships with faculty and open mentorship opportunities. An IA position looks good on your resume when you’re applying for summer internships and post-undergraduate opportunities. IA position description Pay rate: $26/hr Usually, IAs will have a .25 work appointment (10 hours per week). Faculty assign hours to various tasks in the course that are consistent with the 10 hours expected to be worked toward the course each week. IAs submit a bi-weekly time card on hours worked. Hours should meet the allocated level. The tasks can vary across courses, as they should, depending on the course needs. Tasks include running lab/discussion sections, holding office hours, grading, answering questions on Piazza, contributing questions for homework or exams, attending teaching staff meetings, providing assistance on course administration issues, recording and posting scores and grades, etc. Faculty are ultimately responsible for the technical content of the course, including lectures and quality of the exams, assigning the final grades, and ensuring that the course is administered properly. CSE strives to provide an inclusive environment for teaching and IAs are expected to strive to provide that in their responsibilities as IAs. How to become an IA The CSE HR department sends out a solicitation email to CSE students each semester which includes a link to the online application. Generally, Fall applications are open from late March to mid-April, and Winter applications are open from mid-October to early November. Declared undergraduate students in a CE, CS, EE or DSci major or minor have automatic access to the online application. Other students are welcome to apply; they can reach out to Karen Liska to get access to the application and receive important information about CSE orientation dates. *EECS 183, 203, and 280 allow applications from current students regardless of major. Applicants can expect to answer a series of questions on technical background, classroom climate, etc. as well as required questions based on the specific courses they’re applying for. Many courses also require applicants to submit a resume and a teaching demo video with their application. Faculty teaching the class are ultimately responsible for identifying the IAs they want to hire. Often, faculty will retain the existing staff to the extent feasible. Faculty may do short interviews with candidates they are intending to hire for the first time. English communication assessment is required for non-native English speakers. Please reach out to Karen Liska to learn about the process, timing, and requirements. Students may be required to take remediation courses if an assessment identifies a gap. IA positions for the limited number of EECS courses offered in spring, summer and spring/summer terms are negotiated directly with the instructor for the course. Interested students should reach out to the faculty to express interest. Qualifications for the IA positions during these terms include the following: will be an active student at UM in the coming fall term, have taken and done well in the course of interest, have been an IA in a previous term, and is committed to supporting student success. Any additional questions can be sent directly to Karen Liska . What makes a good teaching demo video? The goal of a good teaching demo video is to convey your teaching style and ability. Videos should be 5 minutes long; it’s ok if a video is longer, but reviewers might not watch past the 5-minute mark so make sure you have enough content in the first 5 minutes to convey your teaching style. Don’t spend so much time setting your problem that you don’t get to the teaching of the problem within your 5-minute allotted time. Choose a topic for your teaching demo that you’re comfortable with and is relevant to the course you’re applying to; an ideal topic won’t be the most difficult or the easiest but will have enough content for you to showcase your teaching ability and effective use of teaching tools. After you’ve recorded your video once, take a step back and review the video, looking for mistakes and checking your pacing. Tip: If you’re applying for EECS 203 or EECS 376, try picking an exam question that you’re comfortable with and walk the viewer through your process of solving the exam question. This is good for EECS 203 and EECS 376 because their exam questions tend to be shorter than homework questions, and this kind of teaching is the bulk of the job of an IA in those two courses. For coding courses, try to find a similar kind of lab question that you can walk the viewer through solving. IA orientation and training New IA Training CRLT-E (Center for Research and Learning in Engineering) runs the New IA Training. It takes place in two parts. Part 1 is an asynchronous canvas course that includes surveys and quizzes, discussions, and reflection prompts. Course content covers teaching policies, the honor code, inclusive and equitable teaching, the science of learning, planning effective lessons, classroom assessment, giving feedback, coaching problem solving, etc. Part 2 is a hands-on practice teaching session. This training is required for all IAs. CSE orientation and onboarding CSE also provides some onboarding prior to the start of the term on general guidelines, university rules, and best practices. CSE orientation is required for all IAs. Inclusive teaching training Computing CARES offers an IA Inclusive Teaching Training each semester to IAs supporting CSE courses. There’s an introductory workshop for new IAs and an advanced workshop for returning IAs. Resources How to be an EECS IA (Computing CARES) : Computing CARES offers a workshop each semester on “How to be an EECS IA.” Check their events page for upcoming workshops.

In fact, about 150 undergraduate students conduct research on EECS faculty projects in a typical year; many of these are paid positions. Below you will find some of the research opportunities open to undergraduate students. See the bottom of the page for tips on how to get involved. Independent research projects Students are encouraged to contact individual faculty about doing independent research in an area of mutual interest . EECS 399 and EECS 499, Directed Study, can be taken for 1-4 credits. It provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to work on substantial research problems in EECS or areas of special interest such as design problems. For each hour of credit, it is expected that the student will work an average of three or four hours per week and that the challenges will be comparable with other 400 level EECS classes. An oral presentation and/or written report will be due at the end of the term. Please note: If a student gets approved for an EECS research project after the drop/add deadline, they can submit a late add request in Wolverine Access to get added to the appropriate section of EECS 399 or 499. Students can only enroll in one section of EECS 399 or EECS 499 per term. CS-LSA Honors students cannot enroll in EECS 443 and EECS 499 in the same term. Steps to take to sign up for independent research Students are responsible for connecting to EECS faculty members to find upcoming research opportunities (for tips on identifying research areas or connecting with faculty see the tips section at the bottom of the page). Once connected on a specific project, work with your Faculty Director to determine the following: Brief description of your project How will you be evaluated? Will materials from other classes you have taken be used in the project? How often will you meet with your Faculty Director? How will the completion of your project be determined? Fill out and submit the EECS independent research form . Your Faculty Director must approve your submission before you can enroll. Once approved, the Undergraduate Advising Office will provide an override to help you get enrolled in the appropriate section of either EECS 399 or 499 for the semester. Faculty independent study section numbers Multidisciplinary Design Program (MDP) The Multidisciplinary Design Program provides team-based, “learn by doing” opportunities through participation on ongoing faculty research teams. With MDP, you can: apply what you learn in class to engineering research; gain the technical and professional skills necessary to thrive in engineering research or professional settings; and experience how people from multiple disciplines collaborate within a team. In addition to skilled technical roles, teams offer Apprentice Researcher positions for first and second year students to develop their skills through mentoring by experienced members of the team. A minimum of two semesters participation (2 credits per term) is required. Students are encouraged to participate on their team throughout their degree. Experienced MDP students have presented at research and professional conferences, participated in University patents, and co-authored publications. Experienced students have also taken on leadership roles on their teams. The MDP application opens in September and is due mid-October; projects begin in January and end in December (summer is generally not included). For more information about how to apply to an MDP research team, please visit here or contact [email protected] . Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) Program The Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) offers summer research internships to outstanding undergraduate students who have completed their sophomore or junior year (preference will be given to those who have completed three years of study) by the time of their internship. Participants have the opportunity to conduct 10-12 weeks of full-time summer research with an EECS faculty member on a research project defined by the faculty. Applicants for EECS SURE projects should list on the application their top three areas of interest in preference order. List of SURE projects in CSE (2023-2024) List of SURE projects in CSE (2022-2023) List of SURE projects in CSE (2021-2022) List of SURE projects in CSE (2020-2021) List of SURE projects in CSE (2019-2020) List of SURE projects in CSE (2018-2019) Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) The Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) creates research partnerships between first and second year UM students and faculty. All schools and colleges at the University of Michigan are active participants in UROP, which provides a wealth of interesting research topics for program participants. There are two different ways to engage in UROP research: either throughout the course of an academic year or through a 10-week summer research project. For more information about these research opportunities, contact [email protected] . Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) The Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) is designed for outstanding non-UM students entering into their 3rd or 4th year of undergraduate study and who are underrepresented within their field. The goal of this program is to provide students with the opportunity to conduct an intensive graduate level research project with faculty and graduate students at the University of Michigan. This eight-week program, held on the Ann Arbor campus, culminates in a research symposium where each participant presents their research project. Throughout the program, all students will engage in a series of academic, professional, and personal development seminars. For more information about eligibility requirements, benefits, and the application process, visit here or contact rackham.umich.edu . Tips for getting involved in research Research is a cornerstone of academia. The pursuit of new knowledge is one of the main factors that motivates students to attend the University of Michigan. However, stepping into the world of research can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re not sure where to begin. This guide is intended to help CSE students feel empowered to engage in some form of research during their undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan. Start with what interests you! Your interests might be centered around questions, or topics, or methods, and they may be specific or broad. There is no right way to start—the identification or formulation of specific scientific research questions or ideas will come later. Spend time learning about faculty research interests from their own personal and lab web sites. Most department web sites allow for keyword searches, and you can always use Google and include “University of Michigan” and a department name in the search. Remember, there is no one right way to start.. and the results of your initial search will help you formulate new searches. Go to professors’ office hours. Ask them about their own research projects and find out what most excites them right now in their science. Ask them how they got started in research. You can do a lot to prepare yourself to get the most out of these meetings. Read the “Contacting Professors and Potential Project Advisors” for more information. Attend extracurricular lectures, symposia, and speaker sessions. Going to these types of events are good ways to see what topics academics and professionals are exploring in their fields and may even give you ideas for projects, or even people you would like to work with in the future. Check out the library! Campus libraries have incredible resources beyond books. You can set up an appointment with a librarian to learn how to search for scholarly sources, how to develop a research question, and even how to read empirical research articles. Ever heard of JSTOR, Google Scholar or Interlibrary Loan? Take research methods and/or additional statistics classes. Many of these courses will give you tools you will frequently need when working in a laboratory or collecting your own data! Contact Professors and potential Project Advisors . Reaching out to faculty members for the first time can be intimidating.

Applications will be assessed by the University of Michigan’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Most students will be selected via this pathway, but capacity constraints mean that many students admitted to the University will not be selected for the CS majors. Those who receive advance selection into a CS major must also meet their college declaration requirements (Engineering or LSA) before officially declaring the CS major. How to apply Questions about the CS advance selection process? Please see the FAQs below. You may also contact [email protected] . CS advance selection FAQs Who is eligible to apply for the CS major on the Common Application? Anyone applying to the University of Michigan for undergraduate study in the College of Engineering or the College of LSA is eligible. If I do choose CS on the Common App and am not selected for that major, does that also mean I will not be accepted into the University of Michigan? No, admission to U-M is determined independently of whether you receive the opportunity to enter the CS major. If you are accepted into Engineering or LSA, we hope you will still consider becoming a University of Michigan student. There are other fields of study related to information and computing at U-M and we encourage you to explore those possibilities: Cognitive Science – Computation and Cognition track Computer Engineering Computer Science Minor Data Science (Eng) Data Science (LSA) Electrical Engineering Industrial & Operations Engineering Information Materials Science & Engineering Mathematics Program in Computing for the Arts and Science (PCAS) Robotics In addition, many other engineering majors also include computing components. If I do choose CS on the Common App, am not selected for the major, but am accepted to the University of Michigan, will I have another opportunity to apply to be a CS major? Applicants who are not selected for the Computer Science major will retain their offer to enroll in the admitting U-M College (LSA or Engineering), but should expect to major in something other than CS. If I do choose CS on the Common App and I am selected for the CS major at the time of U-M admissions, am I obligated to pursue that major if I change my mind? No, if in the course of your studies you find that you would rather pursue a different major, you are not obligated to declare CS. If I do c hoose CS on the Common App and I am selected for the CS major at the time of U-M admissions, but decide to defer admission, will I still be able to declare CS? Yes, your selection for the CS major will still be valid if you decide to defer admission. If I do not choose CS on the Common App and am admitted to the University of Michigan, will I have another opportunity to apply to be a CS major? Yes, enrolled students who did not request to be considered for advance selection into the CS major via the Common App during the original application process may apply for the major as an enrolled discoverer once they have fulfilled requirements for declaring CS in their respective college (Engineering or LSA). Details on how to apply for selection as an enrolled discoverer will be available in 2023. Who is responsible for reviewing and making decisions about the applications for the CS major? The University of Michigan Undergraduate Admissions Office reviews and makes decisions about selection for the CS major based on criteria developed by the Computer Science and Engineering Division. What kinds of things will the U-M Undergraduate Admissions Office be looking for in determining who will be selected for the CS major opportunity? There are a myriad of talents and experiences that can help make a student a great candidate for studying CS at U-M, such as dedication to service, an ability and desire to work collaboratively on teams, and consideration of the impact of computing in the context of the broader world. Creativity, innovation, and the learning experience are enhanced through bringing together students from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives. If I requested advance selection into the CS major and was not selected, is there an appeals process? No, selection decisions may not be appealed. If I did not realize that the option to apply for advance selection in CS was on the Common App, do I have a second chance to request selection for the CS major? Yes, you may participate in the application process for the major as an enrolled discoverer after matriculating in the College of Engineering or the College of LSA. Who can prospective students contact with questions about the advance selection process for CS? The University of Michigan Office of Undergraduate Admissions administers the admissions process for undergraduates and the selection process for CS. They can be contacted at: http s://admissions.umich.edu/explore-visit/contact-us How should I decide whether to apply for CS on the Common App or wait until after I come to the University of Michigan? If you are excited about the prospect of learning computer science and believe you can contribute in ways described above, then you may want to request to be considered for advance selection into CS on the Common App. If you are uncertain, you may choose to wait and take courses in computing and other disciplines during your first year of study before making a decision. In either case, a limited number of students will be selected. How should I decide whether to apply for CS in the College of Engineering or the College of LSA? Core major requirements are almost exactly the same for both majors, while other coursework differs between the colleges. Explore a detailed comparison of the major options . Will I have a better chance of getting into CS if I apply via the College of Engineering or the College of LSA? There are many factors considered in the admissions process. We recommend choosing the college whose curriculum and requirements better meet your needs and academic interests. Is there a deadline or timeframe to apply for the CS major? There are two opportunities to apply for the CS major: At the time of application to the University of Michigan via the Common App. The deadline for this is the same as the deadline for application for admissions to the University. Students who did not apply for advance selection into the CS major via the Common App may apply for selection into the major at such a time as they have fulfilled requirements for declaring CS in their respective College. A limited number of students will be enrolled through an application process currently under development for implementation during the 2023-2024 academic year. I was admitted to enroll at U-M before Fall 2023 and either haven’t declared a major or am interested in changing my major to CS. Does the selection process apply to me? Students currently enrolled or admitted to enroll prior to Fall of 2023 will be able to declare CS without the need for additional selection. I was admitted to the University of Michigan before Fall 2023 but deferred and will not be enrolling until Fall 2023 or later. Does this selection process apply to me? No, if you were admitted prior to the admissions cycle for Fall 2023 enrollment, this process does not apply to you. If I am selected for CS, declare CS as my major, and then change my mind and pursue another major, am I able to change my mind again and return to the CS major? Yes, declared CS students who change their majors may switch their major back to CS. Can I get a dual degree in another school or college if I am majoring in CS? Yes, you may pursue a dual degree if you are selected into the CS major. Learn more about dual degree requirements . Does the new selection process apply to the CS Minor? No, the selection process does not apply to the CS minor.

Once admitted, students typically declare a major after establishing an appropriate academic record and meeting any program or other entry requirements. NOTE: Due to capacity constraints, students who are admitted to the University of Michigan in Fall 2023 or later must first be selected for the Computer Science (CS) major before they can declare the major. This selection policy, described in this section of the website, is the same for students in both the College of Engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). The selection policy applies only to the CS major and does NOT apply to students seeking to major in the Computer Engineering (CE) or Data Science (DS) programs jointly administered by CSE with other units. Selection process for CS majors Computer Science (CS) undergraduate majors are available to students in both the College of Engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). Both of these major programs are administered and taught by the Computer Science and Engineering Division (CSE). As with many CS programs at other institutions, enrollment in Michigan’s CS major programs has grown rapidly over the past decade, and the number of interested students exceeds our teaching capacity. As a result, in order to provide a high quality education and to maintain a healthy community, we have implemented a selection policy that limits enrollment into the CS majors. The selection policy applies to students in both the College of Engineering and the College of LSA. NOTE: The CS selection policy affects students who are admitted for enrollment at the University of Michigan in Fall 2023 or later. Students admitted for enrollment prior to Fall 2023 are not subject to the selection policy and may declare the computer science major once they meet their college declaration requirements. Selection pathways for CS Students may apply for selection for the CS major through one of three pathways. Advance selection for first year applicants New applicants to the U-M can request advance selection for the CS major.

CS-LSA vs. CS- Eng What’s the Difference? CS-LSA vs. CS- Eng The department offers two program paths to a degree in computer science. One is available to students enrolled in the College of LSA and the other is for students enrolled in the College of Engineering. NOTE: Due to capacity constraints, students who are admitted to the University of Michigan in Fall 2023 or later must first be selected for the CS major before they can declare the major. This selection policy is the same for students in both the College of Engineering and the College of LSA. The program requirements are almost exactly the same for both majors (Computer Science – LSA and Computer Science – Eng). Computer Science Requirements (both programs): Identical Core Computer Science requirements Similar Senior Design experiences Identical Upper Level Elective requirement Slight difference in Flexible Technical Elective hours and list Declares of both Computer Science – LSA and Computer Science – Eng have availability to the following resources: Engineering Resource Center (assists with all aspects of internships and job placement) CAEN computer account The differences are in the general requirements required of all LSA or College of Engineering students in order to get a degree from their respective college. Differences: Total Number of Credits Required LSA requires 120 credits Engineering requires 128 credits Name of Degree Earned LSA degree is a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) Engineering degree is a Bachelor of Science Engineering (Computer Science) Double Majors LSA students can more easily double-major with other LSA departments Engineering students can more easily dual with other Engineering programs These are general comparisons. For more information about the specific requirements in each college, please consult the College of LSA Academics & Requirements page and the Academic Advising Center or the College of Engineering Bulletin and the Engineering Advising Center . If you still have questions about which program is best for you, please feel free to contact the CSE Undergraduate Advising Office and set up an appointment with an advisor.

Huge amounts of data with complex structures in the form of text, video, and streaming data are routinely collected in social networks (e.g., Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter), biological and health sciences (e.g., drug discovery, patient care), sciences and engineering (e.g., astronomy, networks, smart buildings), business and industry (e.g., automotive, robotics, banking, insurance, ad networks) as well as by government and society at large. Data scientists will help quantify and address the pressing concerns of modern society, including those in healthcare, sustainability, security, equity, and economics. DS-LSA program information The Data Science Major available through the College of LSA is a joint program between the CSE Division of the EECS Department in the College of Engineering and the Department of Statistics in the College of LSA. Data scientists blend techniques from computer science and statistics – such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical learning, probability models, and visualization – to manage, analyze, and interpret data. The data science major is a rigorous program that will provide students with a foundation in those aspects of computer science, statistics, and mathematics that are relevant for analyzing and manipulating large complex datasets. Students will be exposed to both the practical use of data science methods as well as the theoretical properties underpinning the performance of the methods and algorithms. Graduates of the program will be well prepared for exciting careers in data science and will have opportunities for advanced study. DS-LSA program details and declaration information Open to students enrolled in the College of LSA, this program is administered by the Statistics Department in LSA. Students who wish to learn program specifics or declare in data science through the College of LSA should visit the data science undergraduate program page at the Department of Statistics website.

Explore other majors available at the College of Engineering Huge amounts of data with complex structures in the form of text, video, and streaming data are routinely collected in social networks (e.g., Google, Twitter, Facebook), biological and health sciences (e.g., drug discovery, patient care), sciences and engineering (e.g., astronomy, networks, smart buildings), business and industry (e.g., automotive, robotics, banking, insurance, ad networks) as well as by government and society at large. Data scientists will help quantify and address the pressing concerns of modern society, including those in healthcare, sustainability, security, equity, and economics. Data scientists blend techniques from computer science and statistics – such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical learning, probability models, and visualization – to manage, analyze, and interpret data. DS-Eng program information The data science undergraduate program is a joint program between the EECS Department in the College of Engineering and the Department of Statistics in the College of LSA. The data science program aims to train well-rounded data scientists who have the skills to work with a variety of problems involving large-scale data common in the modern world. The focus of the curriculum is computational tools and statistical analysis as well as hands-on experience. The data science major is a rigorous program that will provide students with a foundation in those aspects of computer science, statistics, and mathematics that are relevant for analyzing and manipulating large complex datasets. Students will be exposed to both the practical use of data science methods as well as the theoretical properties underpinning the performance of the methods and algorithms. Graduates of the program will be well prepared for exciting careers in data science and will have opportunities for advanced study. Open to students enrolled in the College of Engineering, this program is administered by the CSE Division of the EECS Department. Enrollment and graduation data DS-Eng program guide DS-Eng Program Guide for students who begin in the College of Engineering before Fall 2024 DS-Eng Program Guide for students who begin in the College of Engineering Fall 2024 or later Historical DS-Eng program guide FA15-WN23 Declaring in DS-Eng Declaration requirements are listed in the DS-Eng program guide. If you meet ALL of these requirements and are ready to declare, please fill out our declaration request form . A staff member will check your eligibility and let you know the outcome. For more detailed questions about the major, students can schedule an advising appointment or come to virtual drop-in advising. In addition, please watch this video prior to declaring. Double major and minor information Data Science in the College of Engineering is a contemporary and exciting major, full of expected employment opportunities and ways to impact the world. It is also flexible enough to consider a double major subject to the rules of the respective colleges. To pursue a double-major within CoE, 14 additional technical credits that are not double-counted between the two majors are required (a total of 142 credits instead of 128 credits). To pursue a dual degree with another academic unit, see the College of Engineering rules on combined degree programs (see section on Multiple Dependent Degree Programs). A double major between Data Science and Statistics is permitted, but a double major between Data Science and Computer Science is not permitted. Most minors that are options for CoE students are also permitted, except for minors in Computer Science and in Statistics, since their credits overlap significantly. The Data Science requirements already subsume the requirements of a CS minor. Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Study Students who enroll in this program and plan to obtain a master’s degree could be eligible for the Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Study (SUGS) program, which enables completion of both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in five (to five and a half) years.

To access this information, visit this webpage . Under “Calendar Type,” select “Registration.” Select the academic term you are interested in from the drop-down menu. Then press “Submit.” For international master’s students, 8 credit hours is considered full-time (unless one has a GSI appointment, in which case 6 credit hours is considered full-time). More information may be found on the International Center’s website . FAQs about the Master’s program in CSE Got a question about the CSE Master’s program and can’t find an answer? You might be able to find an answer to frequently asked questions below. Course equivalency What is “course equivalency”? What is it good for? This is only for satisfying breadth requirements. If you have previously taken a graduate-level class that is very similar to one of the EECS courses that satisfy a breadth requirement, you can request equivalency. If the professor teaching the EECS course, your advisor, and the graduate committee approve, then you can use it to satisfy that breadth requirement. This gives master’s students an additional slot for an elective course. The equivalent course, however, does not satisfy any other requirement. It will not appear on your transcript, it is not calculated into your GPA, and it does not count for credit. You should request this as soon as possible since it can help you plan which courses to take. The equivalency form (pdf) may be found via this link. Prepare to Graduate For specific steps to take regarding submitting a final Plan of Study and the AMDP Election Form (SUGS only), please review the CSE Graduate Programs Guide , “4. Applying to Graduate with the Master’s Degree”. You need to be sure you apply for graduation by Rackham’s Apply for Graduation deadlines. Information on Commencement, Rackham Graduate Exercises, or the diploma can be found on Rackham’s Commencement Eligibility page. Finding a research position and/or a job How can I find a research position and/or a job? Most paying positions are advertised via [email protected] or [email protected] . You are automatically included in these email groups when you join the department. These may describe positions within the department as GSIs, graders or research assistants; positions with professors in other departments that need computer science expertise; or from outside companies. The department has a few GSI positions for MS students, but they are quite limited and usually go to people that have previously been IAs or previously taken the course. Most other positions pay by the hour. For research positions within CSE that may not be advertised, you can contact professors that do research that’s interesting to you. For jobs outside of the university and within the United States, international students may find information via this page on the College of Engineering’s Career Resource Center website. Mental health and wellness resources Where can I find mental health resources? To see a listing of U-M on-campus resources for concerns related to mental health issues, visit the University Health Services Resources for Stress and Mental Health page. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is also a great resource for students. Conflict mediation During the course of your time in the program, you may have a concern or conflict arise within your lab. While it is normal to have differences of opinion when working with others, it is important to know who to reach out to when you’re unsure of how to resolve a situation. We encourage students to reach out to the Graduate Programs Office and/or the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies to seek assistance, as we are here to offer support and resources for CSE graduate students. Other resources on Conflict Resolution and Student Grievances are offered through Rackham Graduate School, and we encourage students to utilize these confidential resources. Students who are interested in a safe and confidential resource regarding conflict or other challenges should also consider reaching out to Rackham’s Graduate Student and Program Consultation Services .

Please note that registering is a separate process and further information follows. Therefore, if you’ve not yet matriculated, you must do so immediately. For assistance, please contact Rackham Admissions at [email protected] . Registration Registration for Fall term opens the beginning of June. You must register for at least one OPEN course prior to the first day of classes to avoid being assessed a late registration fee. If you are unable to register for a class you want (as is typical for most new graduate students), you should get on the waitlist. Once the term begins, you should attend the first day of that class to obtain an override (i.e. permission) from the instructor. For more information see Registration in the section below. Resources related to Registration: CSE Course Resources Atlas – for current and historic data on courses at U-M Registrar’s Office Schedule of Classes – for list of courses offered at U-M by term Wolverine Access , Search for Classes/Course Catalog, for current and historic data on courses, enrollment, catalog data, etc. Note: Beginning Fall 2023, all first year doctoral students are required to register for CSE 601 – Introduction to Graduate Research (1 credit hour) in their first fall term of the program. This course is designed to give students the background knowledge and perspective needed to be successful in grad school, as well as help develop non-technical skills such as presenting and self-promotion. Additionally, this course provides incoming students the critical opportunity to meet their cohort and connect with the wider CSE research community. Funding and student support After arriving on campus International students International students must visit the International Center to complete the mandatory check-in. More information is available here . International students are required to have health insurance and will be covered by CSE at the start of their appointment; however, if you arrive prior to the start of the fall term, you will be responsible for health coverage during this transitional time period. Please contact UM’s International Center for information about setting up your Aetna coverage for this intermittent time period. MCard You must obtain an MCard. This is your official University of Michigan identification card.

Partnering with a coach can change your life, setting you on a path to greater personal and professional fulfillment. “ The CSE graduate programs office offers professional coaching to PhD students in CSE. Coaching sessions are available for individuals and small groups: INDIVIDUAL COACHING (available to second year PhD students and beyond). In a one-on-one meeting with a coach you will explore a particular topic of your choice and plan a strategy and accountability for reaching your goals. If you are interested in individual coaching, please sign up here for an introductory session. GROUP COACHING (available to first year PhD students). In a small group setting you will grow self awareness and a sense of community with others who, just like you, are embarking on this journey. You will define your values, discover what is holding you back from reaching your goals, and determine what you can do to change it. The group meets four times during the Fall semester. Registration for the program is closed. If you are interested in group coaching, please contact Magda Calvillo ( [email protected] ). COACHING FOCUSED ON A SINGLE THEME (group meetings + individual coaching): Leadership Coaching Leadership can take on many forms. The most common understanding of leadership is defined by a position or a title that assumes leading and managing others. But there is more to it. We all are leaders one way or another, at work and at home, and when we choose to be responsible for the direction of how things are going in our lives, how we shape the relationships with others and the experience we create – all of that is leadership. In a small group you will meet monthly throughout the semester with other students who want to improve their leadership skills. The group will meet 4 times during the semester, every three weeks on Wednesdays. In between group meetings you will have 4 individual coaching sessions scheduled at your convenience. Registration for this program is closed. If you are interested in Leadership Coaching, please contact Magda Calvillo ( [email protected] ). Motivation and Productivity Coaching As a researcher you mostly work on your own and it can be really challenging at times when no structure is provided. It is hard to maintain motivation to work and to be productive. Motivation and productivity focused coaching can help you with that. You will identify your time management challenges, develop personalized strategies to improve productivity, set achievable goals, and create routines that align with your priorities to maintain motivation over time. It’s not just about optimizing the use of time, it’s about fostering a sense of control and balance in your life. The group will meet 4 times throughout the semester, every three weeks on Thursdays. In between group meetings you will have 6 individual coaching sessions scheduled at your convenience. Registration for this program is closed. If you are interested in Motivation and Productivity Coaching, please contact Magda Calvillo ( [email protected] ). Constructive Feedback Coaching Constructive Feedback Coaching Program is designed to empower individuals to deliver feedback in a way that is constructive, meaningful, and supportive. This program focuses on developing the skills and mindset needed to provide feedback that promotes growth and improvement, rather than fostering a negative or discouraging environment. The primary goal of the Constructive Feedback Coaching Program is to equip participants with the tools and techniques necessary to deliver feedback and navigate difficult conversations in a way that inspires positive change and professional development. The group will meet 4 times during the semester, every three weeks on Wednesdays. In between group meetings you will have 4 individual coaching sessions scheduled at your convenience. Registration for this program is closed. If you are interested in Constructive Feedback Coaching, please contact Magda Calvillo ( [email protected] ). WHAT IS COACHING? Coaching is a process of facilitating another person’s learning, development, well-being and performance. Coaching helps raise self-awareness: individuals identify goals and create their own strategies to achieve them, develop their own skills, and change their own attitudes and behaviors to reach their full potential. The International Coaching Federations (ICF) defines coaching as “partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. The process of coaching often unlocks previously untapped sources of imagination, productivity and leadership. “ Graduate students explaining coaching process and their experience with coaching offered in CSE. How is coaching different from therapy, mentoring and advising? The differences and intersections between teaching, mentoring, and coaching Coaching is different from advising and mentoring. Professional coach does not tell the coachee what to do but helps them clarify the issue, identify solutions and develop strategy for achieving goals, also, keeps one accountable for moving forward. In contrast to an advisor or a mentor, coach does not offer a solution but supports the client in figuring it out for themselves. That is one of the reasons the coaching process is so powerful: the coachees gain self awareness, they get to experience the spectrum of their own strengths and capabilities. Therapy is focused on addressing emotional, psychological, and mental health issues. It aims to explore and heal past wounds, traumas, and patterns that may be causing distress and negatively impacting a person’s mental and emotional well-being. Advising: in an academic setting an advisor supervises the research work students do. There is a clear agenda and an advisor’s role is to make sure students know what steps they need to take to make progress. Mentoring implies that an experienced and knowledgeable individual provides guidance, support, and advice to someone less experienced, typically referred to as a mentee. The mentor’s role is to share their expertise, insights, and life lessons in order to help the mentee develop their skills, knowledge, and personal growth. Coaching can help to: improve communication with your peers improve communication with your advisor set goals for academic work – discuss priorities, plan strategy and demonstrate accountability get clarification on career dilemma – academia vs. industry reach/maintain work-life balance address imposter syndrome set up healthy boundaries- get better at time management and navigating competing interests maintain work motivation get support in facing many other challenges you encounter in your journey as a PhD student. About the coach – Magda Calvillo Magda Calvillo When I am being asked what coaching is, I like to bring Jenny Rogers’ words: “Coaching is about closing the gap between people’s potential and their current state.” This is the excitement that coaching brings – the raising of self awareness that makes you realize how resourceful you are and how much potential you have. Coaching is a “choice in action” where I assist the people I work with in setting goals and identifying the strategy for reaching them. I keep my coachees motivated and accountable throughout the process. I am an ICF Certified Executive Coach. I hold a Master’s degree in Literature from the University of Gdansk, Poland and a bachelor’s degree in General Studies with a focus on Human Services from the University of Connecticut. The majority of my career I have worked in education as a teacher, trainer, coach and adjunct faculty. I strongly believe that bringing coaching as an additional form of support for graduate students empowers them to achieve even more and grow as a whole person — professionally and personally — to be better prepared for life after graduation.

These guidelines are based on U-M policy and federal law, and were developed to ensure that students on an internship have appropriate financial support and to avoid issues with funding, insurance and/or immigration policies. After receiving approval from your faculty advisor to undergo an internship, you must fill out the CSE Internship Notification Form and also send an email notification to [email protected] at least two months prior to the start of your internship. Please see below for additional and more specific guidelines; these apply to all PhD and Master’s students. Student must be appointed from the first day of the fall term through Dec. 31 or Jan. 1 – Apr. 30 in order to be eligible for GSRA and/or GSI funding and tuition coverage. Official term dates can be found on the University of Michigan’s academic calendar . Student must be in good academic standing and not on financial aid probation or academic probation. Student must be making satisfactory progress towards their degree. If the internship is during the FA and/or WN term(s), then PhD candidates must register for at least 8 credit hours in the form of CSE/EECS 995. Precandidates must register for 6 or 9 credits (according to how you are being funded; 6 credits if supported as a GSI/GSRA and 9 credits if supported via fellowship funding). It is the responsibility of the student and their advisor to determine how tuition, insurance premiums, and any potential stipend will be paid before the internship begins. The College of Engineering requires all students seeking tuition and/or benefits support during the time of their internship to start their inquiries with the Rackham Doctoral Intern Fellowship Program . Students must apply directly to that program for internship tuition and/or benefits consideration. Please note the deadlines to apply for support for Student-Identified Internships are listed on their webpage and can be very early. Therefore, it is imperative that students have discussions with their advisors as early in the process as possible regarding tuition and/or benefits support during internships. If a student is ineligible to receive support from that program, the student/advisor should further consult with the program regarding consideration of other avenues of support, including CoE funding. Student Financial Assistance Requests from the College of Engineering may be available to provide tuition support to students who are within their funding guarantee. If you would like to learn if/how you are eligible for this, please contact [email protected] . Please note that this funding is extremely limited and not all requests are approved. CoE assistance is dependent on if a student first applied for assistance through Rackham or being ineligible for Rackham funding (e.g., has already received Intern Fellowship support), so students should check early about eligibility and requirements. Missing Rackham’s deadlines without a legitimate reason and/or ignorance of CoE’s policy is not sufficient to qualify for CoE support. If you are an international student , then you must ensure CPT compliance. CPT information can be found here. Please direct all CPT-related questions to the Engineering Career Resource Center at (734) 647-7160 or [email protected] Please note that there is a COE Internship Seminar that international students are required to attend as part of CPT. Please be sure to register for this seminar as early as possible, as space can be limited. You may not need a signed offer letter to attend the seminar.

You might be able to find an answer to frequently asked questions below. Guaranteed funding What is guaranteed funding? It is a guarantee from CSE that you will have funding to cover your tuition, health insurance, and a stipend for 5 years. The length of the guarantee changes to 4 years if you entered the PhD program with a relevant master’s degree, or 3 years if you entered the PhD program from the CSE master’s program. This is true for both domestic and international students. Can your advisor take it away? Departmental fellowship funding is typically for one year (other fellowships may have longer duration) and in most cases will not be discontinued as long as the terms of the fellowship award are being met. Faculty advisors, in most cases, cannot take away fellowship funding. This funding type is reserved for some first-year PhD students. GSRA funding is by term (4 months) and typically is not discontinued in the middle of a term. This type of funding is managed by individual faculty and it is possible for it to discontinue in future terms if the faculty member deems it appropriate. If your advisor determines that GSRA funding is unavailable for a term you will need to sign up to be a GSI until new funding is identified by your advisor. If this is an instance of your advisor indicating that the relationship isn’t working out and advising you to find a new advisor, you should apply for GSI funding and talk to the graduate programs coordinator immediately. GSI funding is by term (4 months) and in most cases will not be discontinued as long as the terms of the GSI appointment are being met. Note, there is an application period for GSI funding that takes place several months before the beginning of a term so students should plan accordingly. What if something happens in the middle of the term and you can’t get a GSI; does the department still guarantee your funding? GSRA appointments run for an entire term so this is unlikely to happen. If it does happen it is the responsibility of your advisor to continue funding you for the remainder of the term and you are still guaranteed funding. If this happens to you please reach out to the grad programs coordinator for advice. Note, there is an application period for GSI funding that takes place several months before the beginning of a term so students should plan accordingly and apply for a GSI appointment if conversations with their advisor indicate that GSRA funding may not be available in the following term. What happens if you do not receive a paycheck? This shouldn’t happen. If it does, please contact Karen Liska ( lisk a @umich.edu ). Changing advisors How do I change advisors? You may have some questions, such as: How do I have a conversation about changing advisors? Who should I talk to? Who should help me with my concerns about changing advisors? How do I maintain a positive relationship with my old advisor? When is it time to switch advisors? Does my current advisor want me to find a new advisor? What do I do if my advisor wants to go in a technical direction that is different from my current research plan? Is the funding still guaranteed while searching for a new advisor? How much time do I have to search for a new advisor? What happens to the prelim while I’m in the middle of switching advisors? What if my advisor tells other advisors not to accept me as a student? Detailed information about changing advisors can be found on this page . Logistically, you will submit this form , completed and signed by your old and new advisors, to the graduate programs office. Am I allowed to have a primary advisor outside of CSE? Yes, however, a CSE faculty must be found to act as an academic advisor. This will help to make sure that you remain aware of CSE’s milestones and procedures. The academic advisor may also act as a research co-advisor, but this is not a requirement. More information may be found in the CSE Graduate Programs Guide (Google Doc) . Mental health and wellness resources Where can I find mental health resources? To see a listing of U-M on-campus resources for concerns related to mental health issues, visit the University Health Services Resources for Stress and Mental Health page. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is also a great resource for students. Conflict mediation During the course of your time in the program, you may have a concern or conflict arise within your lab. While it is normal to have differences of opinion when working with others, it is important to know who to reach out to when you’re unsure of how to resolve a situation. We encourage students to reach out to the Graduate Programs Office and/or the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies to seek assistance, as we are here to offer support and resources for CSE graduate students. Other resources on Conflict Resolution and Student Grievances are offered through Rackham Graduate School, and we encourage students to utilize these confidential resources. Students who are interested in a safe and confidential resource regarding conflict or other challenges should also consider reaching out to Rackham’s Graduate Student and Program Consultation Services . What if I still have questions? We are happy to talk with you about any of your questions. Please contact the Graduate Programs Office for further information or for suggestions of others with whom you can discuss your situation. If after browsing this list and the resources on this website you still have a question you may submit it via this Google form .

Please note: If you do not see any advising appointments, additional appointments will likely be added in the near future. In addition, you can attend drop-in advising, no appointment necessary (see details below). Most GPO advising appointments are currently being held in a remote format. If you would like an in person appointment, they are available upon request. Email [email protected] for help scheduling. Staff advisors handle the majority of advising needs for graduate students, such as course planning, releases/degree audits, facilitating forms/exceptions/requests, and understanding academic policies. PhD Students: Jasmin Stubblefield Terminal Master’s Students: Amanda Feaganes SUGS Students: Tiffany Smith Faculty advisors are best equipped to handle additional advising questions related to industry knowledge, course content, research, graduate school and/or career advice for all CSE graduate students. They are a great resource for questions that are best answered by someone with direct knowledge in the CS fields. Please check with your assigned faculty advisor directly whether they have fixed advising hours or you need to make an advising appointment. Please note that, especially during the busy first and last couple of weeks of a term, you may not hear back from your faculty advisor immediately. Master’s Faculty Advisors: Sugih Jamin – SUGS Advisor Mosharaf Chowdhury Jonathan Beaumont Laura Burdick After making an appointment For Master’s/SUGS Students: Please have a copy of your Plan of Study ready to share before the start of your appointment.

No, however, most successful applicants have a degree in computer science, engineering, physics, or mathematics. Your application should demonstrate that you have sufficient preparation to succeed in the required courses for the degree program, which are detailed in the program guide (Google Doc) . Do online courses or courses taken at a community college carry any weight? All application materials are considered holistically and ranked in relation to other CSE applicants. Do you accept transferred credit? Please refer to the Rackham Graduate School Academic Policies page for information regarding the transferring of credit into a CSE Master’s degree program. Rackham does not allow credits to be transferred to a PhD program. What is the difference between the M.S. and M.S.E. program? The MS (Master’s of Science) and MSE (Master’s of Science in Engineering) degree requirements are the same. Students with a bachelor’s degree in engineering can elect either degree citation. Students without an engineering bachelor’s degree are eligible only for the MS. If I’m interested in both the PhD and MS program, do I need to submit an application to each? No. If you are interested in both the PhD and MS programs in CSE, you should fill out the PhD application and indicate on page 9 of the application that you would like to be considered for the MS program (should you not be offered admission to the PhD program). There is no effect on your PhD admissions review if you select this option on the application. Can I apply to more than one Rackham graduate program (e.g. ECE MS or PhD)? Yes. To apply for a program other than CSE, you must complete a separate online application, pay a separate application fee, and submit separate copies of ALL required credentials, GRE scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc. Please refer to the Rackham admissions page for instructions. The application doesn’ t appear to be open. When can I apply for the program? The Rackham Graduate Application closes over the summer (starting around June) and will reopen for the new admissions cycle in late August/early September. Do you have part-time or evening programs? All CSE graduate programs are intended for day-time students. Some Master’s students choose a part-time schedule of one course per term. Students working full-time would need cooperation from their employer as CSE does not offer evening or weekend classes. Do you offer department visits before applying to CSE? The CSE division does not participate in formal college visits other than the Explore Graduate Studies Workshop held each fall. Interested students may find more information here . How do I apply for departmental financial aid? Every applicant offered admission to the PhD program will be considered for financial support. No separate application is required. Admission at the MS level is not accompanied by financial aid. For more information, please refer to the Funding page . What matters most when the Admissions Committee is evaluating applications? When evaluating applications, the Graduate Admissions Committee considers every aspect of your application. What is the difference between the academic statement of purpose and personal statement? Your statement of purpose should address your academic research interests, past research experience, and future career goals. Your personal statement should describe how your life experiences affected your decision to pursue a graduate degree. Some suggested topics for your personal statement are: volunteer and/or community service; extra-curricular activities; leadership activities; educational, cultural, geographic or socio-economic background underrepresented in your discipline of graduate study; financial hardship; first generation U.S. citizen or first generation in family to graduate from a four-year college. I don’t see the faculty member I am interested in working with on the CSE advising list on the Rackham Graduate Application. What do I do? If you do not see a specific faculty member listed in the dropdown, please include their name in another area of the application (e.g. the statement of purpose or the Additional Information section). The application can be searched by faculty using keywords and they will be able to find applicants that indicated their names within the application. We cannot add their names to the list once the application is live. Can you waive or defer the application fee? No. The application fee is determined by the Rackham Graduate School. CSE is unable to waive or defer it. Can the GRE be waived? GRE scores are neither required nor expected. The Graduate Admissions Committee (made up of CSE faculty) will not consider any scores that are submitted when reviewing applications. Each application will be holistically reviewed and ranked in relation to the other applications received. Can the English Proficiency test be waived in certain cases for non-native English speakers? Yes, the English Proficiency test (e.g. TOEFL or IELTS) can be waived if you meet one of Rackham’s exemptions. A list of those exemptions can be found here . What application materials are required? Please see the list of required materials here . Please follow the CSE application checklist and Rackham’s application checklist carefully. Is an official transcript required at the time of application? No. If you are offered admission, however, you must submit a final, official transcript to the Rackham Graduate School with your degree posted that includes the date your degree was awarded. How do I submit an official transcript? Submit a transcript for each Bachelor’s, Master’s, Professional or Doctoral degree earned. For instructions on submitting transcripts, please see the Rackham Graduate school website . For CSE’s requirements, please see the How to Apply page . Note: All credentials submitted for admission consideration become the property of the University of Michigan and will not be returned in original or copy form. Who should write my recommendation letters? Your letter writers should be people with whom you have worked closely, and who are familiar with your academic work and research potential. It is suggested that at least two of the recommendation letters be from academia. I have been in the workforce for several years. Should I ask my employer or supervisors to write letters in support of my application? It is suggested that at least one of your letters be from a faculty member who knew you well. The other two may be from employers. Keep in mind that the CSE Graduate Admissions Committee wants to know about your aptitude for completing coursework and conducting independent research. Character references do not carry as much weight. What should I do if my recommender has not received an electronic invitation to recommend me? This tends to be a problem with how a recommender’s email account is set up. The invitation is either blocked or automatically filtered into a junk mail folder. An applicant can check the status of their recommendations, resend a recommendation request, and even change a recommender if the recommendation is not yet started via an applicant’s Personal Activity page. This page may be accessed under the Manage Your Account section of your online application homepage and by clicking on the Review Your Activity link. Once the application is submitted, the online application cannot be modified. Please refer to the Rackham Letters of Recommendation page for more information. Applicants should contact [email protected] if they need direct technical assistance. Recommenders should contact [email protected] . Can I have my letters of recommendation submitted by Interfolio, email or by physical mail? Our office does not use Interfolio, nor do we accept letters of recommendation by email or physical mail. Please use the Online Recommendation System through the Rackham Graduate Application – DO NOT elect not to use the system, as we will not accept alternate methods of submitting your letters of recommendation. Applicants should refer to the process outlined on the Rackham Graduate School Letters of Recommendation page regarding the submission and/or update of any letters of recommendation. Applicants should contact [email protected] if they need direct technical assistance. Recommenders should contact [email protected] . Is it possible for me to update my application after it has been submitted? No. You should include all relevant information in your application before you submit it. All application materials must be submitted by the application deadline. How will I know all my materials have been received? After you submit your application and create a Friend Account, you will be able to confirm the receipt of test scores, transcripts, and letters of recommendation via Wolverine Access. Follow the directions listed here to set up a U-M Friend Account. Please allow 7 to 10 business days after completing the steps above, to verify your received materials. Please note, CSE is unable to send confirmation when your complete application has been received. Will I be notified if something is missing from my application? It is the applicant’s responsibility to monitor the status of submitted materials via Wolverine Access. Please note that application PDF forms, written essays (statement of purpose, personal statement etc.), curriculum vitae or resumes, transcripts from Community or Junior College, non-degree study and/or study abroad coursework will not be confirmed in Wolverine Access. Please, therefore, review your application carefully before submitting it. You should refer number 8 on the Rackham application checklist for more information. Can my materials be returned to me? No. All credentials submitted for admission consideration become the property of the University of Michigan and will not be returned in original or copy form. How can I unlock my U of M Friend Account? Only Rackham Admissions staff can unlock a Friend Account. Please send an email to [email protected] indicating that your Friend Account is locked. The email should include your name, UMID, and email address registered in connection with the Friend Account. I applied to the CSE graduate program last year and was rejected. How can I reapply? You will need to submit a new application, pay the application fee, and provide new supporting documents. GRE and TOEFL scores will need to be resubmitted only if the scores have expired. TOEFL scores are valid 2 years from the test date, and GRE scores are valid 5 years from the test date. When will I receive my decision notification? The CSE Graduate Admissions Committee, comprised of faculty, begin making admission offers in January and continue through April. You will be notified by email once a decision has been made. Can my friend/relative call and find out my status for me? If you would like to give someone permission to contact the CSE Graduate Programs Office on your behalf, you must indicate this on your application before submitting it. Can my admission or funding (e.g. fellowship) be deferred? Deferral of admission may be granted for up to one year following the original term of application. Decisions are made carefully and approvals are few in number. What are the circumstances under which deferrals may be granted? In rare situations, unforeseen and extenuating circumstances occur that affect an applicant’s ability to enroll. These situations may include a medical emergency, family emergency, delay or denial of a visa to study in the United States, or natural disaster (e.g. earthquake, hurricane). When these types of circumstances occur, an admitted student may request to defer enrollment (referred to as deferred admission) for up to one year following the original term of application. A new application and application fee are not required. If approved, only the offer of admission is deferred and not the guaranteed funding type. Circumstances such as employment, enrollment at another institution, funding, or indecisiveness regarding enrollment are typically not appropriate justifications for requesting deferred enrollment. Requests for deferrals of up to one year are sent to [email protected] and the reason deferral is being requested must be included in the email. Consideration beyond one year requires submission of a new application, application fee, and required documentation. Whom can I contact if I have a specific question? If you have a specific question that is not answered here, please contact the CSE Graduate Programs office via email at [email protected] .

An exceptionally attractive feature of our program is that students admitted at the PhD level are guaranteed full financial support for their MS/PhD studies, as long as they are making satisfactory progress, meet required milestones, and maintain a research advisor relationship. PhD-bound students are supported during their first year as fellows and/or GSRAs; all students are then supported as GSRAs or GSIs in their second and subsequent years. Admission at the MS level is not accompanied by financial support, although opportunities do exist. Since availability of GSI positions is by a term-by-term basis, we advise our MS students to be prepared to fund their entire graduate education. Bridge program This is an internal fellowship program for students considering going on to the PhD program. You will be notified if you are being considered for the Bridge program. First-year student support Fellowships: CSE Fellowships are awarded, based on available funds, to incoming PhD students. No application beyond what was submitted to Rackham is required. These fellowships, like the GSI and GSRA positions listed below, provide tuition and fees, monthly stipend for living expenses, and university healthcare and dental coverage. Students are required to identify an area of research and begin work with a faculty member within their first year of study. Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Graduate Student Research Assistant (GRSA): GSI and GSRA positions are filled by both incoming and current graduate students, with the positions primarily being filled by students already in the program. Incoming students are offered GSI and GSRA positions based on their application materials. No additional form is needed. Current students wishing a GSRA position should contact faculty directly. Current students desiring a GSI position must take part in the departmental application process which takes place two times during the academic year. GSIs and GSRAs are usually expected to work 16 to 20 hours a week, receiving full tuition and fees, monthly stipend, and university health care coverage. Students are required to identify an area of research and begin work with a faculty member within their first year of study. GSI Resources – U-M Center for Reseach on Learning and Teaching GSRA Guidelines – U-M Human Resources Process for assigning GSI positions in CSE Online applications are solicited by way of an email announcement sent to students in the EECS Department twice per academic year; in March with a deadline in early April for fall positions and in October with an early November deadline for winter positions. The online application is available to declared EECS graduate students. Others should reach out to unit HR. All CSE guaranteed financial aid (PhD) students are placed first. This has been about 40% of our GSIs in recent terms. The remaining GSI applicants will be placed as they are identified, with preference being given to CSE students. Faculty can recommend you (with a simple email to CSE HR), and if there are equally qualified students for an opening, the faculty preference will be considered once we get to the stage of assigning students from the applicant lists. Generally, you should have taken and done well in the course for which you are applying, either at the University of Michigan or an equivalent course elsewhere, or have demonstrated knowledge of the course content through applied skills with employment or volunteer experience. The class size policy affecting the workload for the majority of GSI positions varies by course. Section assignments (discussion or lab) could be from 25 students up to 60 students and support for lecture-only enrollment is based on room capacity. The level, content and structure of the course impacts the number of students in any one section. Additionally, faculty service or administrative workload, initial offering of a course, signification revision of an existing course and feedback from faculty on how the staffing worked in a prior term can all affect how the workload is distributed. The course content can affect the ratio; graduate vs undergraduate, project-based, programming, theory, etc. Changes in the class size are requested by the faculty and approved by the Associate Chair for Academic Affairs with support from the staff authorized to manage the override process. Additional information for GSI candidates. Language (English) Proficiency Requirements . The English Language Institute has developed a procedure for testing the spoken English of prospective GSIs whose undergraduate education was at an institution in which the language of instruction was not English. The evaluation procedure is a performance test that consists of four tasks that assess a candidate’s competence and effectiveness in the type of communication typically used by GSIs at the University of Michigan. The test evaluates proficiency at the high intermediate to advanced level. The tasks and evaluation criteria of the Graduate Student Instructor Oral English Test (GSI OET) also serve as diagnostic tools to identify linguistic strengths and weaknesses. This information is used to recommend or require placement, if needed, into courses offered through the English Language Institute.

This Accelerated Master’s Degree Program (AMDP/SUGS) allows students to complete requirements for both degrees in five years. Many students who enroll in this program plan to enter industry but seek additional intellectual depth beyond the bachelor’s degree. The relatively small investment in time to get a master’s degree will lead to greater professional opportunities and significantly higher salaries (see Michigan Engineering employment data ). Students who wish to pursue a CSE master’s degree at a slower pace should apply to the regular (i.e. non-SUGS) CSE master’s program and students who plan to pursue a Ph.D. should apply directly to the CSE Ph.D. program. Eligibility Current University of Michigan undergraduate students studying Computer Science-LSA or Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Data Science (Eng or LSA), or a minor in Computer Science are eligible to apply to the CSE Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Studies (SUGS) program. Engineering students, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (SJTU-JI), and Multiple Dependent Degree Program (MDDP) students with dual majors are not eligible for SUGS (see more info here ). However, LSA double majors can apply for SUGS. Degree Requirements Explore other Master’s programs at the College of Engineering SUGS students follow the degree requirements for the terminal CSE MS program (these requirements can be found in the CSE Graduate Program Guide ). Successful completion of 30 credits of coursework is required. A thesis is optional. SUGS students must enroll in Rackham for at least two full terms (at least 9 credit hours each term), paying Rackham tuition, if they plan to graduate in two terms. Double Counting and Transfer Guidelines The SUGS Master’s degree is an accelerated program allowing for the double-counting of graduate-level credits between the undergraduate and graduate programs. Approved Coursework : Check out the MS Course Requirements (Spreadsheet) to see what graduate-level courses can be double-counted or transferred to SUGS (see “Approved for SUGS double-count and/or transfer” column). CSE SUGS students can bring in a maximum of 15 credits into Rackham. Double count up to 9 credits of technical or free elective BSE requirements (credit counts towards undergraduate AND graduate degree). Double counted credits can only come from graduate level courses that may be used towards a CSE Master’s degree. Double counted credits may be divided/split (e.g. if you have three courses at 4 credits each – 12 credits total – you may use up to 9 credits from those courses). Transfer up to 6 credits into the Rackham graduate degree (credit will ONLY count towards graduate degree if approved). These transfer credits cannot be used for any portion of the undergraduate degree. Transfer credits may not be divided/split up in any way (e.g. if you have two courses at 3 credits each – 6 credits total – you may transfer both courses. If you have two courses at 4 credits each – 8 credits total – you may only transfer one of those courses.). Transfer happens after a student has been admitted to the SUGS program – please review Rackham’s Transfer of Credit policy for more details. Prerequisites to Apply The Admissions Committee has determined that performance in these areas best demonstrates an applicant’s educational readiness for graduate studies in our program. However, please remember that applications are reviewed holistically and students who demonstrate strong performance in CS or related curriculum are still encouraged to apply. Must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.6 or higher at the time of application submission. Must maintain that GPA through the completion of the undergraduate degree. Must have completed EECS 281 with a grade of B+ or better by the application deadline. Must also have completed either EECS 270 or EECS 370 with a grade of B+ or better by the application deadline. Must have taken at least four EECS courses from 370, 376, or any EECS courses that are Upper Level Computer Science (ULCS) Elective or Flexible CS Technical Elective at the 300-level or above by the end of the first semester of the senior year. For any EECS ULCS or Flex CS Technical Elective elective class taken at the 300-level or above, a grade of B+ or better must be earned. Note: While CS Minor students may not be able to take at least four EECS elective classes at the 300-level or above, they are still welcome to apply. Must only earn one Bachelor’s degree – Data Science (Eng or LSA), Computer Science (Eng or LSA), Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or be minoring in Computer Science. Note: Engineering students, SJTU-JI, and MDDP students with dual majors are not eligible for SUGS (see more info here ). However, LSA double majors can apply for SUGS. Timeline to Apply As students head into their penultimate (next to last) year, they may wish to meet with a CSE Graduate Programs Office staff member to discuss their plan for double-counted courses (this is not required). Or, an email may be sent to [email protected] with any questions. In the final year, students should apply for admission to the graduate program by submitting: Rackham Graduate Application Three letters of recommendation (at least one letter must come from a core CSE faculty member ) A personal statement A statement of purpose An unofficial copy of your transcript ( current U-M applicants should attach their unofficial transcript to their application – this will expedite the review process ) Completed Accelerated Master’s Degree Program Election Form (including courses to be double counted, but does not need to be signed) – this form can be found through Rackham’s Forms page, and should be added one of the other attachments, preferably the transcript. Application deadlines SUGS is sequential, meaning students may only apply for the Fall or Winter term directly following graduation. So if you are graduating in the Fall term (December) and want to start a CSE Master’s degree in the following Fall term, you must apply to the Terminal MS degree (you may not take a gap year or term and still apply to SUGS). Fall Term Winter Term January 15th , 11:59 PM ET October 1st , 11:59 PM ET For undergraduates who are graduating in the Winter or Spring/Summer terms, you would apply to begin SUGS in the Fall term. Applications for this term will be reviewed AFTER the deadline and admitted students may be notified sometime in March. There is no need to contact faculty during this review period. For undergraduates who are graduating in the Fall term, you would apply to begin SUGS in the Winter term. Applications for this term will be reviewed AFTER the deadline and admitted students may be notified sometime in November. There is no need to contact faculty during this review period.

Students must meet all Rackham requirements for the SUGS master’s degree (rackham.umich.edu/academic-policies/section5/). The complete Master’s requirements can be found in the CSE Graduate Program Guide (Google Doc) . View a list of courses that satisfy the different MS degree requirements (Google Sheet) . Students admitted to the Master’s program may apply to the doctoral program. Admission depends on academic qualifications as well as the availability of openings in the doctoral program. For questions regarding the SUGS program, please contact the CSE Graduate Programs Office at [email protected] . MS vs. MSE degree The MS (Master’s of Science) and MSE (Master’s of Science in Engineering) degrees differ mainly in name. The degree requirements are the same. Students with a bachelor’s degree in engineering can elect either degree. Students without an engineering bachelor’s degree are eligible only for the MS. Apply to a Master’s program This page has information about graduate school admissions . Financial aid information The CSE Division has limited financial aid to award to Master’s students at the time of application. On the other hand, Master’s students occasionally receive a research or teaching assistantship after they begin their studies. Master’s students are encouraged to apply for fellowships from sources outside the University. See an overview of financial aid resources .

The focus is on advanced CSE topics, on learning to perform research and to write research papers, and on making fundamental new contributions to a CSE topic. Students take advanced course work and write a doctoral dissertation , also called a thesis . Program overview Students newly admitted to the doctoral program are classified as precandidates . Upon entering a doctoral program, there is a Ph.D. qualifying process, normally completed during the first two years. After all requirements except the dissertation are completed, students become candidates . Students entering a CSE doctoral program with a bachelor’s degree typically become candidates in the third year and are strongly encouraged to complete the degree within five years. Such students ordinarily complete the requirements for a master’s degree along the way and receive this degree in addition to the Ph.D. A masters thesis is optional. Students who enter a CSE doctoral program with a master’s in the field of their program typically become candidates in their second year and are strongly encouraged to complete the degree within four years. Such students are not ordinarily eligible to receive a CSE master’s degree. The complete doctoral requirements can be found in the CSE Graduate Program Guide (Google Doc) . View a list of courses approved for the different doctoral degree requirements (Google Sheet) . Continuous enrollment In order to encourage timely completion of the degree, University policy requires doctoral students to register every Fall and Winter term until their degree is completed, with very few exceptions. That is, doctoral students cannot take time off from their studies, or pursue the later stages of their degree without registering, except in special circumstances. Transferring credits A limited number of graduate credits earned elsewhere may be transferred to meet the coursework requirements for doctoral students earning a master’s degree. In addition, a course taken elsewhere that is equivalent to a course satisfying a degree requirement here can be used to satisfy the requirement, even if course credits are not transferred. If granted, however, such equivalency does not not reduce the total number of credit hours required for the master’s degree, unless the course is transferred. Apply to a PhD program This page has information about graduate program admissions . Financial support The CSE doctoral program admits only those students for whom financial support can be guaranteed for the anticipated duration of studies (five years for students entering with a BS, four years for students entering with an MS), assuming satisfactory progress is made.

To learn more about research in CSE, visit our research areas page and read recent news stories that report on research . In addition, there are a number of research centers and labs at CSE with which corporate partners can interact with and/or support. The U-M Business Engagement Center can help industry in making a number of types of connections, including for research collaborations and technology transfer. The College of Engineering also provides resources that can help to facilitate corporate connections to CSE research. Sponsoring research Research support provides an opportunity to connect with faculty on their area of expertise and interest. These direct connections can provide important insight into the future of a particular area, can help companies recruit students with the best skills to meet their needs, and develop a network of contacts that can assist when engaging on campus. Contact us for additional information. Donating equipment Equipment donations are a great opportunity to enable faculty to utilize your equipment and build relationships. Often these donations facilitate research and activities that were not previously possible. To explore this opportunity, contact a CSE lab director or the Department .

Master’s student Brent George shares about why he chose to pursue his master’s in CSE at the University of Michigan. One of the great parts about the CSE master’s program is that there’s such a wide breadth of courses that are available to meet requirements… You can really pick and choose and tailor your program. First year PhD student Joan Nwatu hopes to use artificial intelligence to solve problems in accessibility. She’s building connections in the U-M CSE community and in the Michigan AI Lab, where her specific interests are in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Here it’s different. Instead of competing against each other, you’re competing against yourself and you have people around to help you. PhD candidate Sarah Jabbour began her education in computer science after taking EECS 183 in her third year of undergraduate studies. Now, she participates in the Michigan AI Lab as a PhD candidate and works to develop machine learning models that can map chest x-rays to diseases with the ultimate goal of augmenting clinical care. I like being a PhD student because you form a bond with your research topic. You get to go really deep into the weeds on a topic that’s really exciting to contribute to and have your name on it. PhD candidate Mohamed El Banani has always been interested in questions about perception and intelligence, which has led him to the field of computer vision and machine learning to build models that can understand images and video. Interviewed in his fifth year of study, he has advice for prospective students on how to pursue your interests and find your path. You’re going to be spending five years working with a professor and their lab. So figuring out the personality fit and how you work and how the faculty advisor works is very important. This can be a determining factor in your PhD success and in your happiness throughout the PhD more generally.

Life as a CSE Grad Student Resources for Student Support and Inclusion Student Groups and Teams CSE Action Plan DEI and Climate Initiatives ↗ Reporting Concerns and Misconduct Home > Community > Reporting Concerns and Misconduct Reporting Concerns and Misconduct In Computer Science and Engineering, we aspire to create an educational environment where all community members can thrive. Reporting climate concerns and misconduct can be confusing, and we are committed to supporting community members through this process. This page provides initial resources and information on how to formally report misconduct and other concerns in CSE. Quick Links When to report How to report Report anonymously File a formal report Discuss your concerns in CSE Confidential conversations When to report U-M guidelines for conduct Standard Practice Guide > SPG 601.89, policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct > SPG 201.89-1, Discrimination and Harassment > Student Rights & Responsibilities > CSE strives for a community built on respect and integrity. Actions against those values do not only hurt our community members, but weaken our community and what we can achieve as a whole. While we respect the choices of those who experience misconduct, we hope everyone feels comfortable pointing out instances of wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. If you experience inappropriate behavior or misconduct, or if you are unsure that you have experienced such behavior, there are resources and contacts available to you. CSE encourages all students, faculty, and staff with concerns about the department or something they’ve experienced to report what they know through any of the channels described on this page. For our graduate and undergraduate students, please do not hesitate to report things like poor classroom experiences, negative faculty or staff interactions, discrimination, or patterns of microaggresions. Even if your concern doesn’t fit the criteria for a formal university report, these are serious issues that deserve attention. How to report There are two ways that you can report concerns or misconduct: filing a formal report or anonymously through CSE. Report anonymously : CSE maintains a form for encrypted reporting and a physical dropbox. Either way, your comment is anonymous. This approach limits CSE’s ability to follow-up or address concerns. We encourage all CSE community members to report their concerns formally through the University of Michigan process. This can be done primarily through the Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX Office. Other formal reporting options include the U-M Ethics, Integrity, and Compliance website or through the UM Division of Public Safety & Security. Some community members may want to speak with someone to determine appropriate next steps or to walk through the reporting process. Individuals can either have conversations with confidential contacts within the University or speak or discuss their concerns in CSE. Report anonymously There are two ways that you may submit an anonymous report. Please note that these anonymous reporting methods do not constitute the filing of a formal report. Submit an encrypted message Any student, staff, or faculty can submit an anonymous, encrypted message via the form below which will be delivered directly to Prof. Nikola Banovic, faculty chair of the CSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. While your comment will be anonymous, Prof. Banovic is an individual with reporting obligations, so he may be required to submit a report. var ifr = document.getElementById(\"JotFormIFrame-200355919281052\"); if(window.location.href && window.location.href.indexOf(\"?\") > -1) { var get = window.location.href.substr(window.location.href.indexOf(\"?\") + 1); if(ifr && get.length > 0) { var src = ifr.src; src = src.indexOf(\"?\") > -1 ? src + \"&\" + get : src + \"?\" + get; ifr.src = src; } } window.handleIFrameMessage = function(e) { if (typeof e.data === 'object') { return; } var args = e.data.split(\":\"); if (args.length > 2) { iframe = document.getElementById(\"JotFormIFrame-\" + args[(args.length - 1)]); } else { iframe = document.getElementById(\"JotFormIFrame\"); } if (!iframe) { return; } switch (args[0]) { case \"scrollIntoView\": iframe.scrollIntoView(); break; case \"setHeight\": iframe.style.height = args[1] + \"px\"; break; case \"collapseErrorPage\": if (iframe.clientHeight > window.innerHeight) { iframe.style.height = window.innerHeight + \"px\"; } break; case \"reloadPage\": window.location.reload(); break; case \"loadScript\": var src = args[1]; if (args.length > 3) { src = args[1] + ':' + args[2]; } var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = src; script.type = 'text/javascript'; document.body.appendChild(script); break; case \"exitFullscreen\": if (window.document.exitFullscreen) window.document.exitFullscreen(); else if (window.document.mozCancelFullScreen) window.document.mozCancelFullScreen(); else if (window.document.mozCancelFullscreen) window.document.mozCancelFullScreen(); else if (window.document.webkitExitFullscreen) window.document.webkitExitFullscreen(); else if (window.document.msExitFullscreen) window.document.msExitFullscreen(); break; } var isJotForm = (e.origin.indexOf(\"jotform\") > -1) ? true : false; if(isJotForm && \"contentWindow\" in iframe && \"postMessage\" in iframe.contentWindow) { var urls = {\"docurl\":encodeURIComponent(document.URL),\"referrer\":encodeURIComponent(document.referrer)}; iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({\"type\":\"urls\",\"value\":urls}), \"*\"); } }; if (window.addEventListener) { window.addEventListener(\"message\", handleIFrameMessage, false); } else if (window.attachEvent) { window.attachEvent(\"onmessage\", handleIFrameMessage); } Use our physical drop box A physical drop box for feedback notes is located on the ground floor of the Beyster Building, behind the Foo Bar. Submissions made here will also be picked up regularly by the Prof. Nikola Banovic, Chair of the DEI Committee. While your comment will be anonymous, Prof. Banovic is an individual with reporting obligations, so he may be required to submit a report. File a formal report This section directs community members to official U-M reporting channels. CSE encourages community members to use U-M channels for reporting situations. These reporting mechanisms are well-resourced and often are able to provide more resources and/or support to the reporting party. To report concerns of sexual assault, stalking, intimate partner violence, sexual or gender-based harassment, other forms of discrimination including discriminatory harassment under the University’s Nondiscrimination Statement, contact the Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX Office . To make a report regarding ethics and integrity, visit the Ethics, Integrity & Compliance website. To report criminal activity, contact the U-M Division of Public Safety and Security . Reporting through the Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX Office Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX Office website Call: 734-763-0235 Contact webform: https://ecrt.umich.edu/about-us/contact-us/ Report online: https://ecrt.umich.edu/file-a-report/ In-person: 2072 Administrative Services Building, 1009 Greene Street You may also report concerns and learn more about the University’s policies and available resources, at sexualmisconduct.umich.edu . Reporting through the Ethics, Integrity & Compliance website The University’s Ethics, Integrity & Compliance website provides complete and updated information on the University’s commitment to maintaining the highest ethical, scholarly and professional standards and provides additional resources and information about reporting. It also provides a reporting link for purposes of making a report related to ethics and integrity. Reporting through the Division of Public Safety and Security To report concerns of possible criminal conduct: Division of Public Safety & Security (DPSS) , including UMPD Call: 911, or for non-emergencies, (734) 763-1131 Text: 377911 Email: [email protected] In-person: Campus Safety Services Building, 1239 Kipke Drive Discuss your concerns with someone in CSE For conversations in CSE Faculty and staff are available in CSE to support individuals who may want more information about pursuing a formal complaint, may want to provide input on an issue, or just generally want to process an experience in CSE. The following information will help community members determine whom they may wish to contact. Assistance from Individuals with Reporting Obligations (IROs) An Individual with Reporting Obligations (abbreviated IRO, sometimes informally called a mandatory reporter) is a University administrator, supervisor, or employee who is required to share information they have received about possible sexual or gender-based misconduct with the Title IX Coordinator in the Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX Office. This misconduct includes Sexual Assault, Sexual/Gender-Based Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Stalking, Retaliation, and Violation of Protective Measures and must be reported within 48 hours of being informed . IROs will report a situation on your behalf or can help you report a situation yourself. An online training module is available for IROs to complete to better understand their responsibilities. CSE Faculty IROs Since CSE faculty supervise GSIs and/or GSRAs at various points throughout the year, community members should assume that all CSE faculty are IROs (i.e., everyone on this webpage with the following titles : Core CSE Faculty, Tenure-Track Faculty, Teaching Faculty, Research Scientists/Investigators, Courtesy Faculty, and Emeritus Faculty). Individuals with specific questions about faculty IRO status should contact the Unit Administrator Kelly Cormier ( [email protected] ) and CSE’s Human Resource Coordinator Karen Liska ( [email protected] ). CSE Staff & Additional Community Member IROs ECRT provides this flowchart to help community members understand their IRO status. In general CSE Managers (or those who supervise others) are IROs. Staff should reach out to their supervisor if they have questions about their own IRO status. Have a supportive conversation with someone in CSE Individuals may want to talk with someone before starting a process.

Are You New to Computer Science? Computer science is an exciting and impactful discipline – but if you’re not familiar with CS, it can seem pretty mysterious and difficult to approach. You might feel that without prior experience, a college career in CS isn’t possible. The University of Michigan believes that anybody with an interest should be able to explore CS – and that it’s never too late for a new student to dive in. Why study CS? People come to computing from a number of different backgrounds and experiences, and study it with their own goals in mind. Maybe you want to… Devise slick new software to make work or life a little easier Automate everything from driving to manufacturing to dangerous or tedious jobs Make our lives online more secure Design hardware and electronics that are smaller, faster, more efficient, and more powerful than anything we’ve seen yet Model social, financial, or biological processes to advance human knowledge Design games or VR/AR experiences Tackle next-generation distributed computing problems on cloud servers or with blockchain Improve healthcare technology Send software into space (on a satellite or rover) The list of what inspires students to pursue computing goes on – and CSE at the University of Michigan can equip you with the tools to get started. Getting started in CS at Michigan If you’re unsure about pursuing a degree in computing, or if you’re a non-major looking for more coding or technical experience, CSE offers several opportunities to help you get started. CS Kickstart A week-long introduction to CS that takes students of any gender identity with little to no experience (or who aren’t even really sure what CS is) and shows them what they can do with a CS degree. Learn more > Discover CS – EECS 110 A two-credit course for students with no formal computer science experience that teaches core CS concepts, how to write code, and provides hands-on experience with multiple CS areas. Learn more > Introduction to Computers and Programming – Engin 101 An introductory computer science and programming course for students in the College of Engineering, covering computing as a tool in engineering, an introduction to the organization of digital computers, and programming in C++ and MATLAB. Learn more > Elementary Programming Concepts – EECS 183 An introductory computer science and programming course for students in the College of LSA, covering the basics of computing as well as problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Learn more > Choose your future in computing If you are a prospective or current student with an interest in pursuing CS at Michigan, there are options available to you. Computer science undergraduate majors are available to students in both the College of Engineering and the College of LSA. Both of these major programs are administered and taught by CSE. For students applying to the University of Michigan for admission in Fall 2023 or later, there is an opportunity to request selection to a CS major at the time of application, and for enrolled discoverers (those who did not previously request selection to a CS major and have developed an interest in CS) there is an opportunity to request selection to a CS major after they have completed the college declaration requirements and are ready to choose a major. The guidelines for requesting selection for the CS major can be found here. There are other fields of study related to information and computing at U-M and we encourage you to explore those possibilities: Program in Computing for the Arts and Science (PCAS) Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering Data Science (Eng) Data Science (LSA) Robotics Industrial & Operations Engineering Information Mathematics Cognitive Science – Computation and Cognition track Or consider a CS Minor Computing is a relevant tool in every field — and a valuable addition to any student’s skillset. If you’re considering bolstering your major coursework with classes in CS, the CS Minor is a great way to structure your efforts. Read more about declaring a minor .

CSE has a detailed emergency action plan that adheres to College of Engineering’s requirements. You can see the complete plan in this document (pdf). Emergency contact information In the event of an immediate emergency, get to safety and dial 911. To report activity or behavior that seems suspicious or of concern, contact University Police at 734-763-1131. For more information on workplace emergencies and for resources that can help people who are distressed or disruptive, please see the U-M Workplace Emergencies page. How to react in an emergency Active attacker Run, Hide, Fight. Have an escape route and attempt to evacuate. Evacuate even if others disagree and leave your belongings. If you can’t leave, hide and be prepared to fight. For important detailed information on how you should react during and after an active attacker incident, visit the Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) website and see the video below. Run, Hide, Fight: see the video Fire Fires on college campuses can occur in classrooms, kitchen areas, and labs, as well as in other areas. In case of a fire, exit the building using the nearest or alternative safe route. Congregate in the main parking lot on Hayward Street on the north side of the building or in the Gerstacker Grove on the south, away from the building. Severe weather Severe weather includes inclement weather during which there is a severe weather warning. Go immediately to one of the two designated storm shelters in the building: rooms 1670 or 1690 Beyster Building. Lab accidents The best way to prevent lab accidents is to be prepared and knowledgeable about what you are working with such as equipment, chemicals, or biological materials. Having a range of knowledge for each type or chemical/biological class of hazard you will work with is called a “working understanding” of your environment in the lab. Contact 911 or OSEH at (734) 647-1143. Serious injury or medical emergency If you believe emergency medical attention may be needed, call 911 immediately and provide the following information: Location of the incident or the injured parties Nature of the injury, cause and severity Victim’s age and name, if known Any known medical information While awaiting emergency response: Keep the victim(s) calm and reassured that help is on the way Do not attempt to treat or move the victim(s) if you are not formally trained in first aid Be careful if you come in contact with blood or other body fluids—they may be infectious Stay with emergency responders until released AEDs for cardiac arrest In the case of a sudden cardiac arrest, proper use of an Automated Electronic Defibrillator (AED) device can greatly increase the chance of survival. Red AEDs are located right next to the elevator doors (main elevator shaft) on each floor of the Beyster Building. To review how to use an AED, see this information on the Red Cross website. First aid & non-life threatening injury or illness First aid kits can be found in the undergraduate advising office (2808), on top of the refrigerator in the 2nd floor lounge (2901), in the graduate office (3909), in the CSE office (3808), in the loading dock (3969), and on top of the refrigerators in the 3rd and 4th floor kitchens (3649 and 4649). For non-life threatening injury or illness, go to: U-M Occupational Health Services University Health Services For more information about safety and security at the College please visit the College of Engineering Safety website . Report an facility problem or emergency To report a problem with the facility either routine or emergency, please use the information here . Beyster Building safety contact information To make suggestions or to report non-emergency safety concerns, please contact any of the following. Facilities Coordinator Stephen Reger 3965A Beyster Bldg. [email protected] 734-764-2132 CSE Department Manager Kelly Cormier 3705 Beyster Bldg. [email protected] 734-764-8505 CSE Safety Committee [email protected] After an emergency or safety related incident All safety related incidents (accidental injury, violence, disasters, medical emergencies, and security threats) occurring within College of Engineering facilities must be reported to the College of Engineering Safety Committee using the CoE Safety Incident Report Form . Indoor drone use policy According to University of Michigan policy , indoor use of a drone or Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) on UM property does not require an application or waiver, but may only occur in a University space or building that has established policies and procedures to permit the safe operation of drones, and only with written permission from the both the building manager ( Stephen Reger ) and unit administrator ( Kelly Cormier ). The following constitutes the Beyster Building Best Practices document in regards to safe operation of drones inside Beyster. This policy pertains to research- and CSE camp-related drone flight only. Personal drone flight is not allowed in the building. CSE requires groups to reserve Tishman Hall for use during the drone flight. A facility manager (Stephen Reger) and faculty experienced with UAS must supervise the flight operation. UAS free flight is not allowed in the Beyster building. UAS’s should not be flown in hallways or gathering areas of Beyster. Eye protection must be worn by people within 20 feet of the UAS when it is in flight. Heavier multicopters (over 250g) operating in open spaces require some combination of tethering, the use of prop guards to protect against potential injury from spinning blades, safety glasses, and clearly marking/blocking the area to minimize chances of a bystander wandering into the flight area. CSE will consider a store-purchased drone to be one that has no modifications added to the drone. If someone adds anything to the drone which changes the design or integrity of the drone it will be considered built from scratch. No minor can operate any drone without the direct attention and proximity of a qualified and designated supervising adult. Faculty using drones during high school summer camps held in Beyster are required to adhere to the requirements for “heavier multicopters” for the safety of minors attending the camps, as noted above. Individual faculty are responsible for ensuring the safety of any flight occurring strictly in their research labs. Anyone seeking to fly a drone outdoors must work with the UM Autonomous Systems Committee (IASC) led by Pete Washabaugh to gain proper authorization.

Designed to bring in and reflect natural light and featuring a spacious four-story atrium along with 100,000 square feet of lab, office, and meeting space, the Beyster Building encourages and precipitates interaction, creativity, and collaboration. Named for four-time U-M alumnus, entrepreneur, and philanthropist Dr. J. Robert Beyster and his wife Betty, the Beyster Building features a spectacular four-story spiral staircase that winds by lounge areas on each floor; those spaces offer faculty and students places to mingle or hold spontaneous conversations and impromptu meetings. Inside the diag entrance to the atrium, visitors will find one of the most significant remaining displays of the ENIAC – announced in 1946 and widely considered to be the first electronic general-purpose computer – which was built in part by Arthur Burks , founder of the program in computing at Michigan. The Bob and Betty Beyster Building is located at 2260 Hayward Street, Ann Arbor, 48109-2121 .

Robert Beyster was a four-time U-M alumnus, founder of the largest employee-owned research and engineering firm in the United States ( Science Applications International Corporation ), and founder of the Foundation for Enterprise Development . Dr. Beyster passed away at the age of 90 in December 2014. His wife, Betty, is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, a member of the ARCS Foundation , and an active volunteer and philanthropist. In recent years, the Beyster family has contributed to the College of Engineering at Michigan in the areas of experimental biofuels, cloud computing and security, and gene therapeutics. They have also funded a class on employee ownership through the College’s Center for Entrepreneurship. In April 2012, the Beyster Building was dedicated in appreciation for the Beysters’ gift of $15M to the College. A substantial portion of that gift endows the J. Robert Beyster Computational Innovation Graduate Fellows Program, which funds up to 10 engineering doctoral students each year. For more information about the Beyster’s philanthropy, visit the Michigan Engineering Beyster Impact website .

This history highlights some of the major events and recognizes a few of the many dedicated and visionary people that contributed to the development of a formalized program in the field of computer science and engineering at UM, resulting in the current CSE Division. 1946–1956: Computing emerges at Michigan Research into the areas now recognized as computer science and computer engineering at UM began in the years following World War II. Technology developed for the war effort opened doors for further inquiry, and researchers of different backgrounds were motivated to define and expand this new terrain. Michigan alumnus Arthur Burks helped create the ENIAC and inspired early work at Michigan after joining the faculty in 1946. He became the first full-time Chair of CCS in 1967. Arthur W. Burks, who received his PhD in philosophy at UM in 1941, had participated in the design of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania from 1943 to 1945. Developed for the War Department, the ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a range of computing problems. In that work, Burks was associated with J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly of the Moore School, Herman Goldstine of Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and John von Neumann of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton. Burks and Goldstine accepted an appointment to join Von Neumann at IAS, and the three published their seminal 1946 paper, “Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument,” which described the architecture for a general-purpose computing machine. Burks joined UM in the fall of 1946 as an assistant professor of Philosophy in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). In 1949, with the aid of funding from the Burroughs Corporation, Burks established UM’s first research effort in the field of computers. One result of this early collaboration was the concept of a push-down store for evaluating parenthesis-free logic expressions in the so-called Polish notation, and Burroughs incorporated this idea into their B5000 computer. Outside of Burks’ work, other activities in the realm of computing at UM were taking place. MIDAC, the first digital computer developed at UM. The first digital computer developed at UM was the Michigan Digital Automatic Computer (MIDAC), which was built at the University’s Willow Run Research Center, an off-campus center devoted to defense research projects. Under the sponsorship of the Wright Air Development Center and the US Air Force, work began in 1951 and MIDAC became functional in 1953. John Carr III, an expert in computing, joined UM in 1953 as an assistant professor of Mathematics and supervised the operations and software for MIDAC. MIDAC was large, requiring 12 tons of refrigeration equipment to cool its 500,000 connections and tubes. MIDAC was primarily used for defense work and was not readily available for undergraduate use. Consequently, although Carr began teaching Math 174, Methods in High-Speed Computation , in 1953, few students had the opportunity to run their programs. In 1954, Carr introduced Math 173, Methods in High-Speed Computation I , and Math 174 was renamed Methods in High-Speed Computation II . Bernard A. Galler joined UM in 1955 as an assistant professor of Mathematics and quickly became interested in computing. He sat in on Carr’s Math 173 course and by his second term was teaching the course while Carr continued to teach Math 174. Computational facilities for the University’s academic programs became more available in 1956 when UM got its first IBM 650, which was housed at UM’s Statistical Research Laboratory. That computer was used by students in Math 173 and Math 174. The MIDAC was ultimately shut down in 1958, having by then outlived its usefulness. 1957 – 1960: Graduate program established in LSA as research in CS takes hold In 1956, Burks was approached by John H. Holland, who had recently completed his master’s degree in mathematics at UM and wanted to write a thesis on computer logic that would not be an appropriate fit for the mathematics department. It just so happened that Burks was about to undertake an effort in collaboration with Gordon Peterson of the Speech Department to develop the first formal program of study at UM related to computing. Gordon Peterson cofounded the graduate program in Communication Sciences with Arthur Burks and helped establish the undergraduate program. Peterson had joined UM in the Department of Speech as an assistant professor in 1953. He was interested in acoustics and phonetics, and his Speech Research Laboratory was active in building electronic equipment for analyzing speech, making recordings in an echoless room, and studying the basic phonetic patterns of speech and speech synthesis. Peterson and Burks found that their research groups shared a common ground and had the same educational problem: graduate students who wanted to do doctoral dissertations on the subjects covered by their grants but who lacked a suitable program. Both felt that Peterson’s interest in communication and Burks’ interest in computation constituted an appropriate basis for a new doctoral program. Accordingly, they petitioned the Graduate School and in 1957 were granted the power to award the Ph.D. and M.A. degrees under a program entitled, “Language Models and Logical Design.” That name was quickly changed to “Communication Sciences.” A number of other UM faculty had related interests: Gunnar Hok (Electrical Engineering – information theory), Anatol Rapaport (Mental Health Research Institute – mathematical psychology), Robert Thrall (Mathematics – operations research), Edward Walker (Psychology – cognition), and Herbert Paper (Linguistics). With Peterson and Burks, they constituted the committee for the Communication Sciences graduate program. Bernard Galler joined the department of mathematics in 1955 and quickly became a part of the computing movement at Michigan. Peterson served as chairman of the graduate program, and Holland was one of the first students to enter this program. In 1957, the same year that the graduate program launched, the ENIAC that Burks had helped to create was shut down. In 1964, Burks would be able to procure and reassemble at UM four of the system’s original 40 panels; it remains one of three significant standing displays of the ENIAC today and can be seen in the Bob and Betty Beyster Building on North Campus. One of Bernie Galler’s students was Francis Allen (MA Math ’57), who would go on to be recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 2006. Allen made seminal contributions in the areas of compilers, optimization, and parallelization in a 45-year career at IBM. Also in 1957, Bruce W. Arden and Robert Graham at the Statistical Research Laboratory began development of the Generalized Algebraic Translator (GAT), a compiler for the IBM 650 that simplified programming. GAT’s relative ease of programming greatly enlarged the user population at U-M and on other campuses where the language was adopted and helped make possible the use of the computer for classroom problems. Carr departed UM to become director of the Research Computation Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The following year, in 1958, an international movement to create a standard programming language for scientific computing resulted in a proposed language called ALGOL (ALGebraic Oriented Language). GAT was used as the basis for UM’s implementation of ALGOL58 (the first version of ALGOL), with Arden an active participant. Arden and Graham published a paper on their GAT work in 1959. GAT’s relative ease of programming greatly enlarged the user population at U-M and on other campuses where the language was adopted and helped make possible the use of the computer for classroom problems. John Holland received the first PhD in Communication Sciences in 1959. The first Ph.D. in Communication Sciences was awarded to Holland, whose thesis entitled “Cycles in Logical Nets” was in automata theory, in 1959. Holland subsequently served as a professor of psychology and computer science and engineering at Michigan. In 1959, the UM Computing Center was established as a part of the Statistical and Computing Laboratory of the Graduate School, and after July 1, 1959 as an independent center within the Horace Rackham School of Graduate Studies. The Computing Center’s first facility was located in remodeled space in the North University Building at 1205 North University Avenue, and it moved to a new facility on North Campus in 1971. Its first director was Robert Bartels, who served until 1978. Arden, Graham, and Galler were amongst the first faculty to be affiliated with the Computing Center. The center installed a sequence of increasingly capable computers from its inception in 1959 through 1991 that were used for research and education. By 1959, researchers at UM and elsewhere were finding ALGOL58’s specification too difficult or impossible to implement. Arden, Graham, and Galler changed the language significantly to address these shortcomings and by the time they finished believed they had a new product, which they named MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder). The UM Computing Center, circa 1960. Bruce Arden is standing and Bernie Galler is seated at right. MAD first began working correctly in about February 1960, and was first used on the Computing Center’s IBM 704. By that time a simpler to implement version of ALGOL, known as ALGOL60, had been proposed, but UM among other centers preferred to stay with their successful efforts rather than starting over. The MAD compiler for the IBM 704 was written in three parts: a front end written by Graham that included the parser, the back end written by Arden which created the machine language, and the middle section by Galler which tied it all together. MAD became universally used throughout UM for many years and also found acceptance at other places, such as MIT, the University of Maryland, and the Ford Motor Company. MAD made it possible to provide flexible computer service to an even larger number of users, again expanding the impact and accessibility of computing. 1960 – 1964: The program in CS takes shape and is a model for others In April 1960, on recommendation of the Dean and Executive Committee of LSA, the Regents agreed that the name of Gordon Peterson’s Speech Research Laboratory should be changed to the Communication Sciences Laboratory, and that the lab would be established as a separate budgetary unit with Peterson reporting directly to the Dean of the College. Space and equipment for the former Speech Research Lab was transferred from the Department of Speech to the new Communication Sciences Laboratory. Michigan alumnae Fran Allen studied with Bernie Galler; she received the ACM Turing Award in 2006. An article in the January 1961 issue of the University Record announced LSA’s intention to expand the Communication Sciences program, then still only officially a graduate program, to the teaching of undergraduates. In that article, Peterson emphasized the program’s unique scientific orientation and the ability of students to customize their education. It was, according to Peterson, “an academic-centered Program with strong emphasis on individual courses of study.” Stephen Cook, who would be recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 1982, earned his BS on Math in 1961 at UM. Cook entered UM in 1957, before the undergraduate program was offered. He was introduced to computer programming in Galler’s freshman course and with a fellow student wrote a program to test Goldbach’s conjecture that every even integer greater than two is the sum of two primes. Cook is currently on the faculty at the University of Toronto where he is a professor of computer science and mathematics. In 1963, the Communication Sciences program for the first time listed an introductory 300-level course for undergraduates in the LSA Bulletin. The program’s approach to exploring communication in both natural systems and in engineered systems was apparent in the opening sentence its description: “The Program in Communication Sciences is concerned with understanding, on a theoretical basis, the communication and processing of information by both natural and artificial systems.” This emphasis on breadth and exploration, at both the undergraduate and at the graduate level, made the Communication Sciences program unique. With a broad objective to understand information processing and communication in both natural and engineered systems, some faculty brought knowledge of psychological, social, linguistic, and biological systems. Others worked on the theory and application of electronic computers and electronic communication systems. All were interested in studying the interrelations of natural and artificial languages as modes of communication, and in comparing computational processes in natural and artificial systems. Students were able to take courses from the departments of Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Linguistics, Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, and Zoology. Michigan alumnus Stephen Cook did his undergraduate work here; he received the ACM Turing Award in 1982. The program relied to a large extent on courses already offered by existing departments. Thus a student would learn about information theory from a course in electrical engineering, about the informational aspects of biology from courses in the biological sciences, and about man as an information-processing system from courses in psychology. While this plan worked well for areas taught by members of the program, it failed in other areas, because a student had to take several courses in order to cover the equivalent of one course of relevant material, and was, moreover, at a disadvantage in academic background. The program therefore gradually developed its own core curriculum. Students were also required to take a course in modern algebra and, when it became available, an advanced course in programming. After completing the core, graduate students were required to pass an integrative oral examination, with more specialized study and a preliminary examination to come later. Design of the core curriculum and participation in the qualifying examinations helped to acquaint a diverse faculty with the broad range of subject matter and, further, to define the focus and scope of the new discipline. Staff were needed to teach these new courses and the more advanced courses they soon generated. Two sources were tapped. First were young scientists in the Burks’ and Peterson’s original research groups, who were often employed on a temporary basis and were, at least initially, part-time. With few funds, the program had to rely on this category to organize and teach the needed courses up until several years after it became a department. The other source of new faculty for the program consisted of individuals already teaching at UM who joined the program to teach courses and work with the program’s graduate students. Henry Swain of Pharmacology introduced a course in the informational aspects of biology; Julian Adams of Biology later replaced him. Harvey Garner and Eugene Lawler of Electrical Engineering brought computer courses to the program. Galler, Arden, and Larry Flanigan, who had been teaching programming courses, added the programming courses. Paul Fitts, Arthur Melton, Richard Pew, Stephen Kaplan, and Walter Reitman all joined at various times to teach the informational aspects of psychology. Michigan alumnus Ted Codd studied with John Holland; he received the ACM Turing Award in 1981. As of September 1964, 41 master’s degrees in Communication Sciences had been awarded and seven doctoral dissertations had been completed. In November 1964, recognizing the rapidly increasing relevance of the program, the Regents authorized the establishment of a new Department of Communication Sciences. In doing so they noted, “This program has been widely recognized for the breadth and training it provides, both for a graduate and an undergraduate.” They continued: “The University of Michigan was the first to establish an interdisciplinary Program in Communication Sciences… Other universities have established programs under the title of Communication Sciences or under related titles, and it is interesting to note that the Program in Communications Sciences at the University of Michigan has been used as a model in almost every case… It can only be a matter of time until communication sciences has achieved a well-respected place in the academic community.” Ted Codd, who would be recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 1981, was an alumnus of the Communication Sciences graduate program, earning his Master’s in 1961 and his PhD in 1965. His thesis was in self-replication of cellular automata, and his advisor was John Holland. Amongst his career achievements, Codd developed the relational model of data in the late 1960s. 1965-1984: The Department of Computer and Communication Sciences is established in LSA When the Regents authorized the establishment of the Department of Communication Sciences, it notably inherited the name of existing graduate and undergraduate programs. Bernie Galler, who would serve as Chair of department from 1973 to 1975, said in a 2001 career interview with IEEEXplore , “We didn’t want to call it Computer Science because it wasn’t a standard computer science department – it had a great deal of interdisciplinary activity. We had a course on biological systems as information processors, and a course on behavioral systems as information processors, along with programming and other things normally found in computer science. The exception was that the numerical methods and the numerical analysis courses were still in the Mathematics Department, and we decided that we wouldn’t try to include those.” In December of 1964, Peterson was appointed to serve as the first chair of the new Department of Communication Sciences with a five-year term to begin July 1, 1965. However, he did not serve in that capacity and left UM. John Holland, Bernie Galler, and Bruce Arden, as well as other faculty from the Computing Center, took appointments in the new department. In 1965, Communication Sciences was introduced as an undergraduate concentration program in the LSA Bulletin. Offered for the first time was CCS 200, “Introduction to Communication Sciences. Harvey L. Garner was installed as Acting Chair on October 1, 1965. This appointment was made retroactively by the Regents in January 1966. In February 1966, the Regents appointed Arthur Burks as Chair effective January 1, 1967, providing that he terminate an assignment at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India and return to campus. An MTS terminal. As the number of computer users increased, the limitations of batch mode processing became evident. In 1967, Graham shared information about his 1966 trip to MIT, where he had observed their efforts in the area of timesharing. Computing Center staff, under the direction of Arden, drew up plans for MTS, the Michigan Terminal System, which replaced the use of batch mode, punchcard-driven computing with a multiprogramming, multiprocessing, terminal-based system that gave each user the impression that there were no other users. Close cooperation with IBM on timesharing led to the introduction of the IBM 360/67M, with the “M” standing for “Michigan.” The two Computing Center people who were the primary developers of all the details of MTS were Mike Alexander and Don Boettner. CCS faculty members including Galler, Arden, and Frank Westervelt also participated. One measure of their success is the fact that within a year of the installation of this first IBM360/67M, IBM had orders for forty more. Other computing centers around the world adopted the use of MTS. Remote terminals were deployed across UM, and the system remained in use until May 30, 1997. In 1967, Burks was able to salvage four of the ENIAC’s original 40 computing units – a high-speed multiplier, two accumulators, and the master programmer – for use as a display at Michigan. The ENIAC had been decommissioned by the Army in 1957 and put into storage in 1958. The panels were so dirty that Burks had them loaded onto a truck and driven through a car wash. After that, a two-year effort was undertaken to restore and preserve this portion of the ENIAC. The ENIAC display was housed in Angell Hall, and Burks used it for laboratory-demonstration sessions in in CCS 469, History of Computers . Mike Alexander of the Computing Center with the IBM 360/67. In 1968, The Regents approved a change in the name of the Communication Sciences Department to “Computer and Communication Sciences,” known shorthand as CCS. According to Galler, “We changed the name a year or two later when we discovered that there was a department at Michigan State University called Communication Sciences, which was really a speech department. We found that we were forever explaining who we were. We changed the name to CCS, Computer and Communication Sciences, and that’s what it stayed until 1984.” In 1972, the concept of CRISP, or Computer Registration Involving Student Participation, began in CCS 673, a course taught by Galler, which developed the concept for a computerized registration system. CRISP would be initiated as the official method for course registration at Michigan in 1975 and moved to a touchtone-based telephone system in 1994. The first woman to receive a PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences was Nancy Martin, in 1973, who was advised by John Holland. The title of her dissertation was “A Study of the Convergence Properties of Sequential Reproductive Plans, a Class of Probabilistic Adaptive Schemes.” By 1973, the undergraduate curriculum, while still highly science-based and interdisciplinary, began looking like more like a typical “computer” program than a “communication” program, with courses that included “Elementary Computer Techniques,” “Elementary Computer Methods,” and “Digital and Analog Systems.” At the graduate level, there continued to be a balanced offering of courses on biological systems and automata theory in addition to what are now considered more mainstream computational pursuits. Students registering for UM classes using CRISP, the registration system that emerged from a concept in Galler’s course. Galler served as CCS Chair from 1973 until 1975, when he became Associate Dean for Long-Range Planning in LSA. His successor was Larry Flanigan, who served as CCS Chair until 1981. In 1975, Holland published “Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems,” one of the most frequently cited works in the fields of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing, with implications for fields as varied as psychology, neuroscience, economics, and linguistics. It led to the widespread acceptance of genetic algorithms as an optimization and search method in computer science beginning in the 1980s. CCS greatly expanded its program for undergraduate majors, so that by the late 1970s it had about 125 declared undergraduates enrolled at any given time. The department also developed its programming curriculum, with a rich and varied sequence of programming courses for both graduates and undergraduates. In 1976, courses were added for FORTRAN, ALGOL, SNOBOL, LISP, and COBOL languages. Moreover, as a department CCS continued to have from 60 to 80 graduate students enrolled each year in the late 1970s, most of whom aimed for the doctorate. In 1979, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing was established with Galler at the first editor-in-chief, a position he held through 1987. The continuing interdisciplinary orientation of the program served to make its graduates more adaptable, given the rapid rate of technological change in computing and communication. Many students came to Michigan because of this breadth, and it helps to account for the eventual widespread distribution of the program’s graduates. However, the program’s popularity outstripped its capacity and large classes and waitlists became frequent frustrations for students. In 1980, Gideon Frieder was selected as chair with a term to begin in 1981. In September 1982, he and Daniel E. Atkins III of the College of Engineering petitioned Vice-President for Academic Affairs Bill Frye for support in establishing a Computer Research Laboratory and for adding several CS and CE faculty. As 1982 came to a close, the department celebrated its 1957 founding in part by establishing a Distinguished Lecture Series. The first speaker in this series was John Vincent Atanasoff, who spoke on “The Beginning of Digital Electronic Computers” on November 9, 1982. According to Galler, “It was a very good department, but very nonstandard as far as computer science went because of our interdisciplinary nature, so we never really were rated in any of the computer science rankings. We felt fully justified in what we were doing because we turned out some excellent PhDs who ended up in research labs all over the country.” Nonetheless, times changed, and in 1984 CCS would be merged into the College of Engineering. 1968 – 1984: Computer, Information, and Control Engineering is formed in the College of Engineering Even as the CCS Department grew and matured as it reached the mid 1980s, the study of and research into various aspects of computing at UM had become increasingly distributed as faculty across campus saw the need and potential for computing. Other departments, such as Aerospace Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and the Business School had acquired computing resources and developed courses in computation tailored to their curricular needs. The Electrical Engineering department was increasingly interested in the theory and utilization of information processing systems and had begun offering its first digital computing courses in 1957. In 1968, three years after the CCS Department had launched, the Regents authorized an interdepartmental graduate program in the College of Engineering (CoE) known as Computer, Information, and Control Engineering (CICE). Its precursors were the Aerospace Engineering Department’s Information and Control Engineering (ICE) graduate program, originally founded in 1953 and which offered courses in guided missile controls, and the EE:Systems graduate program in Electrical Engineering, which had been formed in 1965 from the collected graduate-level activities in computing within EE. Spearheaded by AE and EE, CICE was in many ways engineering’s complement to the CCS graduate program, a multidisciplinary program that built in breadth while tying together the disparate threads of emerging computational studies at CoE. CICE was first chaired by William L. Root of Aerospace Engineering and was based in the East Engineering Building. Units participating in the CICE program included Electrical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and to a lesser extent Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. The CICE program was open to engineering students and also to Mathematics and Physics students in LSA. Degrees offered through the CICE program included the MS, MSE, and PhD in CICE, as well as a two-year professional degree called CICE Engineer. Among the topics covered in CICE were digital computers, analog and hybrid computation, information and coding theory, data transmission, theory of dynamical systems, feedback control systems, and large-scale systems. John F. Meyer was one of the few faculty with appointments in both CCS and in the CICE program, through his affiliation with EE. He recalls that Bell Labs had a particular interest in the CICE Engineer program because of its systems approach, and that some course sections would be 80% Bell Labs employees. In addition, Bell Labs worked with UM to devise a one-year program to suit its needs. CICE listed courses in computing and programming, including Programming and Data Structures, Software Engineering, Compilers, Simulation, Operating Systems, and Database Systems. These courses, taught by Larry Flanigan, Toby J. Teorey, and Bill Riddle, became listed as electives for the CCS graduate and undergraduate programs. Research conducted under the CICE program included investigations into computer architecture, feedback queuing networks, parallel computation, image processing an shape analysis, distributed systems, biomedical signal processing, sensor-guided control for computer-based robots, decomposition theory, graphic languages for robotic programming, and more. Many projects included collaboration with CCS and the Computing Center. CICE, with its hardware and systems focus, and CCS, with its focus on software systems and information processing, recognized that their two organizations were in many ways complimentary. The Chairman of the CCS Curriculum Committee was an ex-officio member of the CICE and vice versa. Among other recommendations, a 1977 review of the CICE program suggested that additional steps be taken to further coordinate between the two units. Michigan alumnus Michael Stonebraker studied with Arch Naylor; he received the ACM Turing Award in 2014. In the decade and a half since its founding, CICE grew to well over a hundred students, with 43 affiliated faculty from five different engineering departments, and a curriculum of almost seventy courses. It was the graduate program for CoE students with an interest in computation. Faculty in CCS who participated in CICE included Larry Flanigan, Gideon Frieder, and John F. Meyer. Faculty in ECE who participated in CICE and later became affiliated with CSE included Daniel E. Atkins, John P. Hayes, Keki B. Irani, Ramesh Jain, Trevor N. Mudge, Norman R. Scott, Toby J. Teorey, and Richard A. Volz. Michael Stonebraker, who would be recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 2014, was an alumnus of the CICE program, earning his PhD in 1971. His thesis was on the reduction of large-scale Markov models for random chains. Stonebraker invented many of the concepts that are used in almost all modern database systems, and his work has been fundamental in enabling the big data industry. 1982–1984: Computer and computing programs are brought together to form a stronger whole A May 1982 CSE interim report prepared for UM vice president Allen Spivey by Bernie Galler (CCS), Keki Irani (ECE), Toby Teorey (ECE), and Larry Flanigan (CCS Chair) described large enrollments and wait lists, excessive teaching loads, and shortages of resources that were hampering progress in the CCS, CICE, and ECE areas of computer science and engineering at UM. That report noted that close cooperation between three units had existed for years and that their combined realm of CSE was experiencing runaway growth. Although no recommendations were made, a need to better address computing at UM was clearly articulated. On January 27, 1983 the Review Committee for the CICE graduate program published its report and pointed to the fractured nature of computing and information systems at UM and its subsequent negative effect on enrollment, faculty recruiting, and national ranking. Noting that top schools in computer science/engineering were much better unified, its principal recommendation was to restructure computer science and engineering at UM. On February 18, 1984 a Memorandum of Understanding between the Deans of Engineering and LSA was issued that recommended that the CCS Department and the CICE program be incorporated in a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Division of a newly named Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department. These organizational changes were approved by the Regents at their February 1984 meeting to take effect July 1984. Galler’s recollection of this was, “We had many discussions over the intervening years about some day needing to merge because the outside world, we knew, saw us as very fractionated. Sometimes people would know about the activity in one place and not in the other, and then we looked very small. So we finally decided in 1983, which became fact in 1984, that we should merge the LSA and Engineering departments. LSA wanted very much to hold on to the undergraduate degree program that we offered in Computer Science. The CICE graduate program was phased out, so we formed a new department called Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.” The new EECS Department would offer three undergraduate degrees: Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science, and though the Department would be fully responsible for the CS program, the degree would remain an LSA one. At the graduate level the number of degrees awarded by the Department also increased, with the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E), Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) available in three areas: Electrical Engineering (EE), Electrical Engineering:Systems (EE:S), and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). 1984 – 2008: CSE, as a part of EECS, expands research directions The summer of 1984 was a very busy one. To integrate the ECE, CCS, and CICE courses into a new program, it was necessary to change their numbers and prerequisites. Revision of the courses themselves was an on-going task, particularly through 1984, and creating the new graduate program was also a major job. The CCS and most of the CICE faculty took appointments in the new department as of Fall 1984. The two parts of the Department were officially referred to as Divisions and were initially headed by Division Chairs. One of the Division Chairs would also serve as the Department Chair. In 1984, the Chair of ECE was George I. Haddad. The first Chair of CSE was Frieder, who had chaired the CCS Department in LSA for the previous three years. Haddad also served as the first EECS Chair. A 1986 restructuring resulted in three divisions (one of which was still CSE), with each headed by Division Associate Chairs, rather than Division Chairs. That same year, John Holland joined a number of Nobel laureates in physics and economics to found the Santa Fe Institute, the premier institution devoted to the study of complex systems. Up to his death in 2015, Holland would serve as an external professor and member of the executive committee of the board of trustees at SFI. Lynn A. Conway, who had made foundational contributions to VLSI and superscalar computer architecture and who had collaborated with Carver Mead of Caltech to innovate scalable MOS design rules and highly simplified methods for silicon chip design, joined EECS in 1985 and also served as Associate Dean of Engineering. She worked on visual communications and control probing for basic system and user-interface concepts as applicable to hybridized internet/broadband-cable communications. Her presence at UM helped to attract faculty to the fledgling architecture program. Conway retired from active teaching and research in 1998. The 1980s saw the establishment of a lab structure that would, with some variation over time, organize the division’s research activities. The Advanced Computer Architecture Lab (ACAL) was established in 1985 with John P. Hayes as director; the Real-Time Computing Lab (RTCL) in 1985 with Kang G. Shin as director; the Robotics Lab in 1984 with Ramesh Jain as director; and the Software Systems Lab (SSL) in 1989 with Bernie Galler as director. In 1985, the ACAL lab purchased an early 64-processor NCUBE supercomputer to be used by investigators, including Trevor Mudge, which kicked off large-scale parallel computing research and development on campus. Mudge and his collaborators published a number of papers over the next few years on the potential offered by parallel computing architectures. The ACAL group at UM would go on to distinguish itself through the pursuit of a number of projects related to high-performance computer architectures. Beginning in 1986, RTCL undertook projects, built a 19-node hexagonal mesh multicomputer called HARTS under an NSF grant. This included the design and implementation of a programmable routing controller, a real-time operating system called HARTOS, and a synthetic workload generator. The HARTS project was instrumental in creating many exciting results on packet routing and scheduling, as well as system software, and educating graduate students who later became renowned in their own fields. The Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI) was founded in 1986 by Daniel Atkins, Richard L. Phillips, and Douglas van Houweling to catalyze the modernization of the University’s IT infrastructure, specifically the move from a mainframe-centric cyberinfrastructure to a workstation-based (and eventually Internet-based) environment. The first director was Bertram Herzog and the center’s first major project was the IBM-funded Institutional File System (IFS) project (1986-1992), which was used extensively by UM, and in NFSv4, the emerging Internet standard for distributed filing. In the 1990s, in joint work with CITI, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was developed by graduate student Timothy A. Howes and has become a widely used standard. The CARMEL robot, an early collaboration between CSE AI and mechanical engineering researchers. The Robotics Lab was superseded by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab In 1988. The AI lab continued to investigate computer vision systems and robotics, which was a focus for Jain, but broadened to encompass intelligent systems and cognitive architectures, which was the focus of work being conducted by John Laird and others. Laird was pursuing work into Soar, a general cognitive architecture that he had been developing since his graduate study at Carnegie Mellon, and which he ultimately commercialized. In the area of autonomous robotics, major early initiatives included a collaboration with Mechanical Engineering on CARMEL (winner of the first AAAI mobile robotics competition in 1992), the DARPA Demo-II program (which placed 2nd in the US Army 1st ground robotics competition in 1993), and RHEX (a biologically-inspired legged robot). Robotics research included robotic manipulation, vision sensors and controllers, gait regulation, and computational neuromechanics. By 1995, CSE began holding annual retreats for their faculty off-campus. Topics of interest included research, faculty search, new courses, and special topics of general interest to the faculty and students. Toby Teorey, who was CSE Associate Chair, took a number of steps to give the CSE program more national visibility and get into the national rankings; until then the program was not ranked. Daniel E. Atkins (standing) led efforts in collaborative computing that resulted in projects such as the JSTOR database. He left EECS to become the first Dean of the School of Information. In 1995, work led by Atkins in the area of digital collaboration led to the release of JSTOR, the first academic journal database. Today, JSTOR hosts more than 10 million journal articles and 45,000 books. In 1996, the School of Information and Library Studies was rechartered as the School of Information (SI) with Atkins serving SI’s first Dean. Many CSE faculty took partial appointments in SI and the two units have enjoyed many collaborations since. In 1999, Holland played a role in the founding of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems (CSCS) at UM. His reputation was often a drawing card for many of CSCS’s new faculty. Based in LSA, the center continues to this day to be a broadly interdisciplinary group that studies systems, from flocks of birds to the Internet, and collective behaviors that can transcend the capabilities of constituent parts. Holland’s interests in complex systems led him on a path away from what was evolving as the mainstream of CSE, and he become less directly active in the department and more engaged in projects through CSCS. In March 2000, CoE Dean Stephen W. Director formed the EECS Futures Committee. This was charged with looking into the organization of the Department, with a focus on how to do better in CS. In an ensuing reorganization, it was decided that EECS would remain one department with one chair, but would now return to having two divisions instead of three: Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) consisting of the former ESE and SSE Divisions, and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Each Division would have an Associate Chair and an Executive Committee composed of four tenure-level faculty, with the Department Chair as an ex-officio member. Laird was the first Associate Chair for CSE under this structure. That same year saw the creation of a CS undergraduate degree in CoE. Prior to that, the only CS undergraduate degree available was in LSA, and though there existed the CE degree in CoE since 1971, there were problems with this arrangement. With the establishment of the new CS degree in CoE, CS would mean a stronger emphasis on software, in contrast to the CE degree where the emphasis would be on computer hardware and systems. Changes were made accordingly and the CE program was modified to complement the new CS degree. The CS degree in CoE (CS-Eng) was to have the same core computer courses as the CS degree in LSA (CS-LSA), but there were differences necessary to satisfy LSA and CoE college requirements. Students who wanted more of a balance between hardware and software could achieve this with either degree by choosing the appropriate elective courses. The first CS-Eng degree was awarded in December 2001. In order to obtain ABET accreditation for the two CS degrees, it was necessary to add five more credits in science to the CS-LSA degree. This would eventually prove a deterrent to students in LSA who wished to study CS, and together with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and other factors, declared majors in CS-LSA began decreasing from a high of 171 in 2002 to an eventual low of 41 in 2011. At the same time, however, declared majors in CS-Eng increased rapidly, from 34 in 2001 to 193 in 2002. This was followed by a gradual decrease to 147 in 2005, and uninterrupted growth in the years to follow. CE saw a precipitous drop in declared majors from 424 in 2000 to 146 in 2005. Although the CE numbers would increase again, from 2005 onward, declared majors in CS-Eng would increasingly grow and eventually outstrip CE. The turn of the decade saw a shift in the focus of some ACAL researchers, including that of Trevor Mudge and David Blaauw, from the development of high-performance computers to the pursuit of new technologies for ultra-low-power computing. “There were lots of reasons for my decision,” said Mudge in an interview ten years later. “One is the obvious environmental benefit of very low-energy technology. There’s also the issue of assuring both reliability and manufacturability of components as we move into the realm of micro-components. And then, of course, there’s the inherent appeal of tackling a difficult problem – the building of low-energy architectures.” In 2002, Mudge and Blaauw authored a paper with CSE alumnus Krisztian Flautner of ARM and graduate student Steven M. Martin that demonstrated a 48% power savings by combining dynamic voltage scaling with adaptive body biasing. That paper received the ICCAD Ten-Year Influential Paper Award in 2012. This was an early project in work that would continue and evolve on low-power architectures. The new CSE building, 2006. In October 2002, the Regents authorized a new CSE Building on North Campus and appointed an architect. The 100,000 square foot building was designed “to provide a state-of-the-art instructional and academic facility to support computer science, information technology and related activities, and student learning spaces.” It was to feature openness and multiple spaces for interaction. Groundbreaking for construction of the project took place on November 21, 2003. In 2005, HV Jagadish co-founded and became Senior Scientific Director of the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI), which was based at UM and which developed and disseminated tools for molecular biological research that involved vast amounts of diverse, multiscale data, an early application of what would come to be called big data. The center was active for seven years and produced tools that remain in use today. In early 2006, the new CSE Building was completed. When the CSE faculty moved in that summer, it brought them all together for the first time in one building. John Holland and Arthur Burks in front of the new ENIAC display in the CSE building, Nov. 2006. In addition to faculty and staff, Burks’ ENIAC display was moved into the new CSE Building from the EECS Building, where it had been previously moved from central campus when the EECS Department was formed in 1984. It was enclosed in a glass display case by the first-floor entrance to the building, where it remains today. At about the time of the move, the question of how the EECS Department should be organized came up again. It was decided that EECS would remain one Department, but with two largely autonomous Divisions, each headed by a Chair. There would no longer be a single Chair of EECS. Each division was given its own budget, sole responsibility for hiring and tenure decisions, and equal representation in College matters. The CSE Division was given responsibility for the CSE graduate program and the CS undergraduate programs in CoE and LSA. The ECE Division was given responsibility for the EE and EE:Systems graduate programs and the EE undergraduate program. The CE undergraduate program would be jointly administered by both Divisions. The new structure for EECS, which had been voted on by the faculty in January 2007, was approved by the Dean and went into effect upon Regental approval on May 1, 2008. This is the organization that remains in force to this day. 2008–present: CSE Division as an autonomous unit As CSE grew to become a more autonomous unit, a number of factors aligned in the manner of a “perfect storm” – and this storm would produce much more rapid growth, increased breadth, and accelerated productivity for CSE. Contributing were the unification of all CSE faculty in the new CSE Building, which facilitated collaboration; the passing of the dot-com bubble, which had depressed enrollments in the mid-2000s; the growing stores of electronic and cloud-based scientific, medical, and corporate data; the increasing impact of social media, open-source programming and e-commerce tools; and the paradigm shift to powerful mobile computing that followed the release of the Apple iPhone in 2007. The short-lived Bob and Betty Beyster Bubbler on the fourth-floor balcony. Partially as a result of rapid program enrollment growth, from 2008 to 2015 the size of the CSE faculty, which had remained fairly stable at about 25 since the early 1990s, grew to a total of 74 by 2015. This brought new reach into established and evolving areas of research, including in computer architecture, networking and security, robotics and autonomous systems, big data and machine learning, medical informatics, mobile architectures and apps, and sensor networks. Notable Passings and Changes Many years had passed since Arthur Burks came to UM in 1946. Sixty years later, on September 4, 2006, Bernie Galler passed away at the age of 77. Then, on May 14, 2008, Burks also passed away at 93. On August 9, 2015, John Holland, the first alumnus of the Communications Program in LSA and Burks’ protégé, died at 86. In 2012, the CSE Building was renamed the Bob and Betty Beyster Building in recognition of a $15M gift to CoE by four-time UM alumnus Robert J. Beyster and his wife Betty. In an unusual salute to the Beysters, following the weekend of February 18th, a fully operational hot tub was discovered on the fourth-floor balcony of the building with a plaque identifying it as “The Bob and Betty Beyster Bubbler.” This caused some consternation at the College and by February 21st, just before officials were set to dismantle it, the hot tub vanished without a trace. The first black woman to earn a PhD in CSE at UM was Kyla McMullen, who defended her dissertation on May 3, 2012. Here dissertation was entitled, “Interface Design Implications for Recalling the Spatial Configuration of Virtual Auditory Environments.” New Academic Programs Introduced Kyla McMullen was the first black woman to earn a PhD in CSE at UM, in 2012. 2008 was the first year for two new academic programs. The Computer Science Minor launched and while administered by CSE, the degree was issued through LSA. The minor was open to students in LSA (except CS students), the Business School, the School of Music, and Engineering (but not EECS students). In addition, an interdisciplinary undergraduate major called Informatics was launched through LSA with CSE, the School of Information (SI), and the LSA departments of Statistics and Mathematics participating. The program provided a grounding in programming, mathematics, and statistics, combined with a study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems. Informatics was discontinued in 2015 and replaced by two programs: an undergraduate program in Information from SI, and a more scientifically-based program in Data Science offered by CSE and Statistics through both CoE and LSA. The first engineering student to graduate with a degree in data science was dual CS/DS major Ryan Schrader, who matriculated in December 2015. Leadership in Computer Architecture Trevor Mudge in a UM ARM lab in 2010. As computer chip circuit densities increased and the demands for powerful, pervasive, and mobile computation expanded, the evolution of computer architecture became a central technological challenge. Building on work which had accelerated over the previous two decades, CSE emerged as a powerhouse in this area, with investigators pursuing research from circuit to data center design. Trevor Mudge’s ARM Research Center, first founded in 2006, was renewed in 2011 to pursue advances in ultra-low energy and sustainable computing. It continues to this day and has become the longest running and most productive research center at the division. In 2013, the Center for Future Architectures (C-FAR), headed by Todd Austin and centered at CSE with the involvement of fourteen other major research institutions, was announced. The $28 million, five-year research center, funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation, was chartered to support the design of the next generation of computers that will enable applications such as computer vision, speech recognition, enhanced graphics, and big data analysis. By 2016, CSE researchers had made Michigan number one in hardware publications for 12 years straight, and researchers including Todd Austin, Scott Mahlke, Trevor Mudge, and Thomas Wenisch each were included in one or more of the ISCA, HPCA, and MICRO Halls of Fame. Networking and Security for Digital Democracy J. Alex Halderman joined CSE in 2009 with an interest in security its impact on public policy and institutions. In a number of research projects from 2009 onward, he exposed the fundamental security shortcomings of many electronic voting systems around the world, including in India, Australia, Estonia, and in the US. In one broadly recognized instance in 2010, his team responded to an invitation to test Washington DC’s secure new Internet-based absentee voting system and were able to hack in, reprogram the system, and download voter lists, all in less than 24 hours. Halderman also highlighted weaknesses in common Internet security protocols and led development of tools to identify and characterize emerging threats on the Internet. With a goal of securing all servers on the Internet, he initiated development of Let’s Encrypt – an Internet certificate authority and server management service that would convert any website to HTTPS automatically and for free, which became functional in 2015. Cooperative Robots lead to Autonomous Vehicles Edwin Olson, left, with his robotics team, which won the MAGIC competition. CSE’s Robotics Lab had been founded in 1984 and had become merged into the Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1988. Major thrusts related to robotics within AI included cognitive architectures, sensing and mapping, learning, and autonomy. In the Fall of 2010, Edwin Olson led a team of students to win the Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge (MAGIC), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and its Australian counterpart. Olson’s team fielded a team of semi-autonomous wheeled robots that were able to create, share, and act on mapping and other acquired data. Before long, Olson leveraged this foundational work in research partnerships with Ford and Toyota to develop autonomous vehicle technologies. Students Leverage, Ride the Technology Wave Beginning about 2009, a resurgent interest in hacking arose amongst students at UM and across the country. This was due to the growing availability of open source APIs and software development kits, ubiquitous networking, the impact of the iPhone and Android platforms on mobile computing, and the ability for students to organize and share their hacks via social media. Tech companies such as Yahoo and Facebook visited campus to evangelize and foster hacking, and Elliot Soloway added fuel to the fire with his twice-a-year 48-hour Mobile Apps hackathon. An early iPhone app built by Soloway’s students, DoGood, became a runaway success in the summer of 2009. DoGood suggested daily good deeds for users and allowed them to share news of their accomplishments. It began as a class project and was refined in Soloway’s 48-hour hack event. The students sold DoGood to digital media company Tonic after being adopted by 70,000 users. Students Mark Yang and Kevin Chan developed iWolverine, the precursor to the official UM app. In July 2010, UM released its first mobile app for the iPhone, which is still in use today. The “Michigan” app had begun life as a student-designed app called iWolverine and was built by CS students Kevin Chan and Mark Yang as a project in Soloway’s class in Winter 2010. The two sold the app, which aggregated data on campus locations, buses, dining halls, events, campus news, and the UM directory, to the UM Information and Technology Service. A new student group, Michigan Hackers, formed in August 2012 to further support the creative urges technology hackers. The group created and hosted the twice-yearly MHacks event, which was to become one of the world’s premier student-run hack events. In 2013, it hosted 1200 students from around the country in an event held inside the Big House, UM’s football stadium. 2011 Student Programming Team: Dennis Matveyev (coach), Jonathan Plotzke, Mark Gordon, Qifeng Chen, and Kevin Compton (coach). In May 2011, a team of three CS students coached by Kevin Compton and Dennis Matveyev of Ford placed second in the world in the highly competitive ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. The team – undergraduate Qifeng Chen, graduate student Mark Gordon, and undergraduate Jonathan Plotzke – was one of only two teams to solve all eight problems in the competition. 8300 teams from more than 1,900 universities, 82 countries, and six continents had originally entered the preliminaries that led to the final competition. In 2010, Compton and Matveyev had coached a team to a tie for 14th place; Gordon, then a U-M senior, was also on that team. In 2018, a Master’s program in data science was launched collaboratively between CSE, the Department of Statistics in the College of LSA, the Department of Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, and the School of Information. In 2020, a gift from the Daniel E. Offutt III Charitable Trust was made to endow the Computer Science and Engineering Division Chair in the name of Richard Orenstein. Looking Ahead CSE looks ahead to a multitude of new challenges. Rapid growth in student enrollments and a much larger faculty have resulted in logistical challenges, and the Beyster Building, opened in 2006, is near capacity. More importantly, research into areas of CSE is further expanding, with projects and collaborations now underway with aims to develop more intelligent and naturally learning assistive agents; to leverage big data for applications in healthcare, governance, and security; to develop new transportation systems; and to develop the new architectures and algorithms to power future computation.

Orenstein Division Chair of Computer Science and Engineering and Lynn A. Conway Collegiate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering The Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of Michigan strives to shape the future of computing and benefit the world through excellence in education and research. Founded by computing pioneer Arthur Burks and Gordon Peterson in 1957, it is among the richest in history and most progressive in vision. John H. Holland received the first PhD in computer science at Michigan in 1959. In 1966, the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) was developed as one of the world’s first time-sharing computer operating systems. Seminal work in the development of computer databases by Edgar (Ted) Codd took place at Michigan in the late 1960s. Today, dozens of our former graduate students serve as faculty at other research universities. Four Michigan alumni – Frances Allen , Edgar Codd , Stephen Cook , and Michael Stonebraker – are Turing Award recipients. Another, Larry Page , co-founded Google, one of the largest and most influential technology companies. Today, our CSE community is large, curious, and engaged, and we continually strive to build a more inclusive and supportive environment that welcomes people from all backgrounds and identities. We express our values with the acronym HACKS , for Honesty, Achievement, Cooperation, Knowledge, and Service. In research and in education, CSE prepares students to make a positive impact on the world and to build a future that will improve the lives of all people. Our faculty mentor students to reach their full potential while leading cutting-edge research to solve human problems and close societal gaps. Through research, our faculty and students are exploring and expanding new directions of inquiry in artificial intelligence, pervasive and cloud computing, chip and device architectures, big data, machine learning, precision health, security and privacy, autonomous transportation, and many other areas. The pervasiveness and relevance of computing today is reflected by our interdisciplinary research in areas such as medicine, education, economics, engineering, and the sciences. Our undergraduate and graduate programs are among the top in the nation and embrace both deep inquiry and cross-disciplinary breadth. In addition to nearly 100 traditional lecture and lab courses taught each year, undergraduate students experience real-world applications through industry-sponsored design projects and internships. They also have the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research projects and on competitive and interdisciplinary student-led project teams. As of Fall 2023, 609 graduate students were enrolled in our Master’s and PhD programs, and 3513 undergraduate students were declared as majors in our computer engineering, computer science, and data science programs. 1449 undergraduate degrees and 223 MS and PhD degrees were conferred in academic year 2022-23. Forward-looking, interdisciplinary research projects form the foundation of CSE’s active and productive connections to industry and government. In FY 2021-22, our research expenditures exceeded $24 million, leveraging long-standing and productive research relationships with a notable range of federal agencies, industry-leading companies, and industry/government consortia. Our vibrant research program results in graduates who are highly sought and actively recruited around the globe. We strive to be a force for positive change in a world with many challenges. Through education, research, entrepreneurship, and collaboration, our ultimate goal is to produce and nurture the bright minds who will thoughtfully guide us to tomorrow, addressing societal imperatives and transforming our world through the power of computational approaches.

Learn more about ecrt file a report scroll for more Statement from U-M’s Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth Seney, on final rule under Title IX April 19, 2024 On April 19, the U.S. Department of Education released its “Final Rule” under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. These amendments clarify the scope and application of Title IX and the obligations of recipients of federal financial assistance, including the University of Michigan, to provide an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including through responding to incidents of sex discrimination. The university is currently reviewing the new regulations. Any changes to current U-M policies will be made with consideration of the university’s commitment to preventing and addressing discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct, and supporting equitable access for all members of our community. Changes will be announced broadly to the U-M community and general public prior to Aug. 1, when the final regulations go into effect. The U-M Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX Office oversees, facilitates and supports the university’s efforts to ensure equal opportunity for all persons regardless of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status in employment, educational programs, and activities and admissions.
