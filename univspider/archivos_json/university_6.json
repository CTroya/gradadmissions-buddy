We invite you to explore the services, opportunities and resources available to you throughout the various stages of your Husky Experience. Undocumented students are immigrants who entered the United States without inspection or overstayed their visas and are present in the United States with or without their parents. They face unique legal uncertainties and limitations within the U.S. educational system. The majority of undocumented students are characterized as youth that were brought to the United States by their parents at an early age and have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives, learning the language and adapting to the same American customs taught to other students in schools. Many undocumented students are resilient individuals who have gone through the K-12 system, excel academically in high schools and wish to pursue a college education.

The University of Washington is at the forefront of addressing the interconnected factors that influence how long and how well we live, from climate change and poverty to systemic inequities and access to medical care. In partnership with community organizations, the UW transforms research into concrete actions that improve and save lives across the country — and around the world. What is population health? Population health is a broad concept encompassing not only the elimination of diseases and injuries, but also the intersecting and overlapping factors that influence health. The UW’s Population Health Initiative is defined by three major pillars: human health , environmental resilience and social and economic equity . Our work addresses the challenges that arise where these pillars intersect. Latest news Initiative releases its 2022-24 Report to the Community May 22, 2024 Initiative awards 13 early-stage pilot grants to teams of interdisciplinary UW investigators May 20, 2024 Initiative selects summer 2024 cohort of Applied Research Fellows May 14, 2024 More news Spotlight on key issues Poverty and childhood health Your early years set the stage for your life. Children who live in poverty have less access to medical care, nutrition and high-quality early education — the foundations for lifelong health. Learn how the UW is working to understand the ripple effects of childhood poverty — and using that research to create better futures for all children. Learn more Location and lifespan How long we live is affected by where we live. Learn what the UW is doing to understand why people in some regions of the United States and the world have a shorter expected lifespan, and how the University is using that research to improve the length and quality of everyone’s lives. Learn more Maternal health For many women around the world — including here in the United States — having a baby isn’t as safe as it should be. Learn what the UW is doing to better understand what causes disparities in pregnancy risks and use that research to improve the health of mothers everywhere.
