Students may focus on one area of computer science, or take courses across the breadth of the field. The degree may be completed on a full-time or part-time basis. For students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field, the requirements can usually be completed over the course of three semesters. We welcome applications from students who did not major in computer science but whose undergraduate work demonstrates strong technical skills. This program is for students who intend to complete their studies at the University of Rochester with an MS degree. Students with an undergraduate degree who wish to get their PhD in computer science at Rochester should apply directly to the PhD program. For application and financial support information see the  . Program Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 30 credits. Of these credits: MS students must pass a comprehensive examination (or essay), typically in the last semester before graduation. Some students may need to take one or more 100- or 200-level prerequisite courses. These courses are not counted toward the 30 credit requirement and are typically taken by students who do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science. In any case, at least 18 hours of the 30 must be courses offered by the Department of Computer Science. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 by the end of their second semester and throughout the rest of their time in the program, and must obtain a least a 2.0 in each course that counts toward the 30 credit hours.

{"id": 2, "url": "https://gradschool.princeton.edu/academics/degrees-requirements/fields-study/computer-science", "university_name": "Princeton University", "content": "Graduate School Main Menu Search \n \n        Jump To:\n       General Information Overview The Department of Computer Science accepts both beginning and advanced graduate students for study and research leading to the degree of Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). These degree programs are sufficiently flexible to adapt to individual plans of study and research. Apply Applicants are required to select up to two areas of research interest when applying. M.S.E.: Two supplemental essays are required. M.S.E.: If\u00a0   is required, a minimum of 28 on the speaking subsection is required. Program Offerings Program Offering: Ph.D. The doctoral program in computer science combines coursework and participation in original research. Most students enter the program with an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related discipline. Some entering students may have a master\u2019s degree, but that is not necessary for success in the program. Every admitted Ph.D. student is given financial support in the form of a first-year fellowship. In addition, all admitted Ph.D. students are automatically considered for the prestigious Wu and Upton Fellowships. In preparation for the general examination, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with a faculty adviser, develops an integrated program of study in one of the departmental areas of research. Such preparation usually requires two academic years for students entering with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and one year for students entering with a master\u2019s. Students are required to stand for the general examination at the end of the second year. A total of 6 courses are required. Three courses must be taken to satisfy the core breadth requirement, with one course from each of three main areas of computer science: Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Theory.\u00a0 All students must fulfill the core breadth requirements plus one additional course by the end of the second year, demonstrating minimum competence in\u00a0three main areas. The remaining three courses can be any 400- or 500-level course from any department in the University. Courses taken outside the Department of Computer Science require approval from the student\u2019s academic adviser and the Director of Graduate Studies. All courses must be taken for a grade. A grade of B+ or higher is required to get credit towards course requirements, although at most one B will be accepted for a course that does not satisfy the core breadth requirements. Individual research areas may request additional courses in excess of departmental requirements or may require students in that subfield to complete specific required courses in fulfillment of course requirements. Breadth requirement core course list: Systems Artificial Intelligence Theory The general examination consists of a research seminar prepared under the supervision of a faculty member, followed by an in-depth oral examination on the contents of the seminar and the associated general area of research. The oral examination tests the student's knowledge in a number of topics relevant to the student's research area. These topics are specified beforehand by an examining committee in consultation with the student. The seminar is open to the public, and at least three computer science faculty members must attend. Two are invited by the student; the adviser chooses a \u00a0third faculty member who could be in any area of Computer Science or related fields. \u00a0The examining committee and the student agree upon a reading list for the exam. This document is to be made available to anyone present in the oral examination, and only questions pertaining to either the material described in the document or presented during the research seminar can be asked during the oral examination. Original research results do not have to be presented, but problems whose solution may lead to a thesis should be discussed. In many cases, the student\u2019s thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required. The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is normally an incidental degree on the way to full Ph.D. candidacy once a student has successfully completed the general examination. The M.A. may also be awarded to students who, for various reasons, leave the Ph.D. program, provided the student has successfully completed the six required courses from the Breadth Requirement. Please note, students admitted to the Ph.D. program who do not wish to complete the program may be considered for an M.S.E. degree with approval from the department and the Graduate School. Ph.D. students who have already been awarded the incidental M.A. are not eligible\u00a0to earn an M.S.E. For students who entered the Ph.D. Program before Fall 2018: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing all the year 2 requirements -- 3 core courses, one additional course, and passing the general exam.\u00a0\u00a0 For students who entered the Ph.D. Program Fall 2018 and after: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing the 6 required courses from the Breadth Requirements. Teaching experience is considered to be a significant part of graduate education. All Ph.D. candidates are therefore required to assist with course instruction for the equivalent of two terms. Pre-FPO The preliminary FPO is a research talk given to the anticipated FPO committee approximately six months before the FPO date. The pre-FPO covers results to date and planned research, and serves as a preliminary critique of the proposed dissertation.\u00a0 Graduate students will present a public talk followed by a private meeting with the committee. \u00a0The outcome of the pre-FPO is not graded. Graduate students are provided with valuable feedback to the committee expects will guide any final work and will be incorporated into the dissertation. FPO Committee must be identical to the Pre-FPO committee; any subsequent changes to the committee require approval from the DGS. The Ph.D. is awarded after the acceptance of the dissertation and completion of the final public oral. Program Offering: M.S.E. The Master's degree at Princeton is a two year, full-time program. All admitted students will initially be enrolled in the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.), thesis-required track. In the spring of year 1, as part of readmission, all students will be given the option to switch to the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), non-thesis track. Students opting to remain on the M.S.E. track must have a confirmed research adviser and should also have a preliminary thesis proposal. Switching from the M.S.E. track to the M.Eng track will be permitted through January of Year 2. All coursework must be taken for a grade. A minimum of 4 courses must be taken in year 1. If, due to scheduling conflicts,this is not possible, approval by the Director of Graduate Studies is required. In no event will time to degree be extended beyond two years. Funding is normally in the form of teaching assistantships covering the four semesters of the program. Summer funding for M.S.E. candidates in the form of a research assistantship may be offered at the adviser's discretion. Students wishing to continue on for a Ph.D. should apply through the normal application process during the fall of their second year of study. Undergraduate senior thesis and undergraduate independent work courses are not included in this policy. The\u00a0 \u00a0is a two year, full-time program of coursework plus submission of an original thesis. Candidates choose a subarea of computer science on which to focus by taking appropriate courses, and writing a thesis under the direction of an adviser.

In order to be readmitted for a second year, candidates must have a confirmed thesis adviser and preliminary thesis proposal by the end of the first year. In addition to satisfactory completion of coursework, candidates must prepare and submit an original thesis as well as present a public seminar on the research. The thesis will be reviewed and graded by your adviser plus one additional reader from the Princeton faculty. If the reader is from outside the Computer Science Department, approval by the Director of Graduate Studies is required. The public seminar is an ungraded 20-minute talk, followed by a 10-minute question session, given in the spring of year 2. This will allow your adviser and reader to give preliminary feedback prior to submission of the final thesis. The written thesis should be a research paper of \"scholarly quality\" -- making a novel contribution to scholarship in the field. The thesis should motivate the chosen research problem, evaluate the proposed solution (e.g., via analysis, measurement, simulation, or prototype implementation), and compare the approach to the related work in the field. While there is no specific length requirement, a reasonable target is a typical conference paper (e.g., 10-15 pages in two-column format or 20-40 pages in single-column, double spaced format).

Students who accelerate may choose to revert their program of study to its original \nlength by communicating this request in writing to the department. \u00a0 There is now a special policy that allows current Princeton students to count up to two courses taken as an undergraduate towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at Princeton. Those two courses must be upper-level COS courses that fulfill requirements of the Master's degree and have been taken in excess of the COS requirements for the undergraduate degree. For example, if you take ten COS departmentals as an undergraduate at Princeton, and two of them are advanced classes that satisfy requirements of the Master's program, then you can count both towards a Master's degree if you are accepted into the program. \u00a0This is a way to reduce your expected time to completion by approximately one semester. The master\u2019s program is fully funded by teaching assistantships. Master's students are required to hold a full\u00a0teaching assistantship each semester that they are enrolled. Candidates for the M.S.E. must prepare and submit an original thesis as well as present a public seminar on the research. The thesis will be reviewed and graded by the student\u2019s adviser plus one additional reader from the Princeton faculty.
