Frequently Asked Questions How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions? Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students.

When reading an application, we get to know the person behind the numbers. We take into consideration your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and life experiences. Just as there is no typical Harvard student, there is no ideal Harvard applicant. We look forward to learning more about you. Frequently asked questions about applying Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials) Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the Applicant Portal. This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application. The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty.

Scores from applicants applying for our Regular Decision program must be reported by the end of February. Do I need to complete an alumni interview for my first-year application? Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview.

Completing the Harvard supplement questions Complete the Harvard Questions with the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir*. This includes the following five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body.

Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are.How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future?Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you. *Please note that the Harvard supplement is separate for the Coalition Application, so you must submit both the application AND supplement for your application to be considered complete. Additional application questions What if I am homeschooled? Each applicant to Harvard College is considered with great care and homeschooled applicants are treated the same as all other applicants. There is no special process, but all relevant information about your educational and personal background is welcome. In addition to the application, all applicants are required to submit a transcript (which can be created by the family member or agency overseeing your schooling), and recommendations. If the application fee presents a hardship for your family, simply request a fee waiver.Hear from Harvard students who were homeschooled, in the Harvard Gazette article ‘Homeschooled en route to Harvard.’ What if I need to make updates to my application after I submit it? Do not resend your application in order to make updates. If you need to update your identification or contact information, or send updates, additional information, or corrections, please do so via the Applicant Portal. Misrepresentation of Credentials Be completely accurate in your application materials. If we discover a misrepresentation during the admissions process, you will be denied admission. If you have already been admitted, your offer will typically be withdrawn. If you have already registered, your admission will normally be revoked, and we will require you to leave the College. Harvard rescinds degrees if misrepresentations in application materials are discovered.The determination that an application is inaccurate or contains misrepresentations rests solely with the Admissions Office and will be resolved outside the student disciplinary process. School Reports and Teacher Recommendations Secondary School ReportThe secondary school report is a required form that is submitted by your school counselor or another school leader. This form gives an overview of the student's academic record. It includes the applicant's academic transcript(s), a letter of recommendation, and a school profile (if available). If a counselor is unable to submit a letter of recommendation for the applicant, another teacher or school leader may submit an additional recommendation letter. Midyear School ReportWhen you apply, your school counselor will often send your transcript with few or no senior year course grades included. That is why the midyear school report is required - to allow us to review your performance in the first half of your senior year coursework. The midyear school report must be completed by your school counselor or other school official. Please request that the midyear school report is completed and returned to our office as soon as possible. Midyear School Report FAQs What if I'm applying Restrictive Early Action and I don't have my midyear grades yet? Restrictive Early Action applicants are not required to submit the midyear report by the November 1 deadline. If you applied Restrictive Early Action and are deferred to Regular Decision, please submit the midyear report and transcript in February, or as soon as your midyear grades are available. I'm an international student and my academic year is different. Do I still need to submit the midyear report? If you study the IB curriculum or the A-level curriculum, then we expect that your school will send predicted grades, based on your current classroom work and the results of any internal or mock exams you have taken up to that point. If your school does not issue official or predicted midyear grades for your final year of school, then you do not need to submit the midyear report form, although the item may remain on your checklist. What if I have already graduated from high school? If you have already graduated from high school, you should ignore the midyear report requirement (though the item may remain on your Checklist in the Applicant Portal) and simply ask your school to send a final school report if you have not already done so. Teacher EvaluationsAsk two teachers in different academic subjects who know you well to complete the Teacher Recommendation forms (which includes an evaluation form and a letter of recommendation). If you wish to submit additional letters of recommendation, you can do so after you submit your application. In your application confirmation email, there will be a personalized link to send to your recommenders. What courses should I take to prepare for applying to Harvard? There is no “one size fits all” rule about which curriculum to study during secondary school years. Students should challenge themselves by taking courses deemed appropriate by their teachers and counselors. But some students believe that “more is always better” when it comes to AP, IB or other advanced courses.While some students prosper academically and personally by taking large numbers of such courses, others benefit from a more balanced approach that allows them additional time for extracurricular and personal development. Even the best students can be negatively affected by taking too many courses at once, and might benefit instead from writing, reading or research projects on subjects of great interest to them.To learn more, read our Guide to Preparing for College. To avoid the “burnout” often seen among secondary school students, please refer to our article, Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation. Is there a specific math requirement? Applicants to Harvard should excel in a challenging high school math sequence corresponding to their educational interests and aspirations. We recommend that applicants take four years of math courses in high school. Ideally, these math courses will focus on conceptual understanding, promote higher-order thinking, and encourage students to use mathematical reasoning to critically examine the world. Examples include rigorous and relevant courses in computer science, statistics and its subfields, mathematical modeling, calculus, and other advanced math subjects. Students’ math records are viewed holistically, and no specific course is required. Specifically, calculus is not a requirement for admission to Harvard. We understand that applicants do not have the same opportunities and course offerings in their high schools. Moreover, many programs of study at Harvard do not require knowledge of calculus. We encourage applicants to take the courses that are available to them and aligned with their interests and goals. Students intending to study engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other fields where calculus is needed may benefit from taking calculus in high school. However, students at Harvard can still pursue such fields by starting with one of our introductory calculus classes that has no high school calculus prerequisite. On balance, we encourage all students to master foundational mathematical material instead of rushing through any of the more advanced courses. Final School Report and TranscriptsAll admitted students who choose to enroll are required to send a Final School Report and transcript as soon as their final grades become available – no later than July 1. The Final School Report and transcript should be completed and sent by a school counselor or other school official through Parchment/Docufide or Scrip-Safe International, if your school has access to these submission options.IB students should send their final results as soon as they are released in mid-July. We will expect to see final A levels results by mid-August. Standardized Test Scores For the College Classes of 2027-2030, students may apply for admission without standardized test scores. Please read our announcement for more details on the application changes for the upcoming cycles. If you choose to submit standardized tests, you may submit the SAT or ACT (with or without the writing component). While the College Board no longer offers Subject Tests and they are not a requirement for applying, you may submit Subject Tests taken in the last 5 years. If you choose to submit Subject Tests, it is more useful to choose only one mathematics test rather than two. Similarly, if your first language is not English, a Subject Test in your first language may be less helpful. Standardized Testing FAQs How do I let Harvard know whether I would like my application reviewed with or without test scores? When you apply for admission, you can choose whether or not our review of your application will include your standardized test scores (SAT and ACT). If your scores already are on file before you apply and you choose at the time of your application to proceed without scores, we will not consider those scores. If you initially chose an application review without scores and would now like to include scores in your file, you may make this request by submitting the \"Change to consideration of test scores\" form on your Applicant Portal. If you ask that our review includes your scores, either at the time of application or after you apply by submitting the form in the Applicant Portal, they will be part of your application throughout the admissions process. Can I self-report my test scores? Yes. Applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, IB, etc.). Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores. How do I send my test scores? You are free to use the College Board Score Choice option or the similar option offered by the ACT. Our official codes are 3434 for the College Board SAT Reasoning Tests and 1840 for the ACT if you are submitting official test scores as part of your application.How to send your SAT scoresHow to send your ACT scores Are there test score \"cutoffs\"? There are no score cutoffs, and we do not admit “by the numbers.” For the ACT, we will evaluate your highest composite score and any other scores you choose to share with us. We take into account your educational background when reviewing your scores. Should I prepare for standardized tests? Opportunities to prepare for standardized tests vary greatly for students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Research indicates that short term test preparation usually has little effect, but the free “test prep” now offered by the SAT and the ACT might make a significant difference for students who follow their programs for extended periods of time. Such free programs could help to level the playing field for students from under-resourced schools by providing the academic skills that will serve them well on standardized tests and also in college. Students can also do well by studying widely and deeply over a long period of time on their own with the help of family, school, or community organizations. What do standardized tests and grades indicate about academic preparation for college? Standardized tests provide a rough yardstick of what a student has learned over time and how that student might perform academically in college - but they are only one of many factors considered. High school grades in a rigorous academic program can also be helpful in assessing readiness for college courses, but the thousands of secondary schools around the country and the world employ various high school curricula and a wide range of grading systems - and some have no grades at all. Other students have been homeschooled or prepared for college by taking part in multiple schooling opportunities both in person and electronic.Given the wide variation in how students prepare for Harvard – as well as the fact that most applicants and admitted students have outstanding academic records – it is difficult for high school grades to differentiate individual applications. That does not mean that high school grades are unimportant. Students who come to Harvard have done well day to day in their high school studies, providing a crucial foundation for academic success in college, including a 97% - 98% graduation rate.SAT and ACT tests are better predictors of Harvard grades than high school grades. However, admission officers understand that not all students attend well-resourced schools throughout their lives, and that those who come from modest economic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for standardized tests. Each application to Harvard is read with great care, keeping in mind that talent is everywhere, but opportunity and access are not. Does Harvard accept SAT Subject Test scores? As announced by the College Board, Subject Tests and the essay portion of the SAT have been terminated, except in certain special circumstances. See the College Board's announcement for more details. Harvard admission officers review all material that an applicant submits, so if you have already taken Subject Tests or the essay portion of the SAT, you may still submit it along with your other application materials. How do I choose whether to submit my standardized test score? Choosing whether or not to submit test scores is a personal decision for every applicant. There are many reasons why students do not submit test scores, including expense. In general, though, anything that might give a more complete or positive picture of an applicant can be helpful. Even if you feel your test scores do not fully represent your strengths, perhaps because of a lack of resources at your school or limited opportunities to prepare for or take the tests, you could note this fact in your application to provide context. There are no score cutoffs and we do not admit “by the numbers.” Why can't I view my standardized test scores in the Common Application? Since Harvard College is not requiring applicants to submit standardized test scores for the 2022-2026 application cycles, your standardized scores will not display in the Common Application PDF preview, even if you have chosen to submit them. However, if you entered your test score information and would like it to be considered, that data will still be transmitted to us with your application and we will review it. You can verify this by viewing the Application Checklist in your Applicant Portal. You will see a green check mark if we have received your standardized test scores. How will Harvard evaluate the new digital SAT? The College Board's shift to a digital delivery of the SAT will not impact the way in which Harvard reviews test scores within applications. For the College Classes of 2027-2030, students may apply for admission without standardized test scores. Students who do not submit standardized test scores will not be disadvantaged in their application process. Please visit the College Board FAQs for more information. Supplemental Materials Our standard application materials typically give us ample information for making admission decisions. However, we recognize you may have truly exceptional talents or achievements you wish to share, and we want you to have every opportunity to best represent yourself. At the discretion of the Admissions Committee, supplementary materials—such as music recordings, artwork, or selected samples of academic work—may be evaluated by faculty. These materials are entirely optional. Material Types How to submit documents and articles Scholarly articles, research, creative writing or other documents of which you are the primary author should be submitted in the Upload Materials section of the Applicant Portal. This is the most efficient and direct method of submitting these materials, because they will be added directly to your official application. All submissions should include a list of any individuals with whom you collaborated in the production of the work. If appropriate, please identify your research sponsor, mentor, and/or laboratory or research group leader and provide a short description of your particular contribution to the work. How to submit media (video, audio, or images) You may submit optional supplementary media materials (e.g. videos, audio recordings, or images) electronically via Slideroom. Details for submissions in art, dance or choreography, musical performance or composition, will be found on the Slideroom website. There is a small submission fee, but if this fee causes you economic hardship, you may request a fee waiver at the point of submission. You may also contact us to request a fee waiver.If you encounter technical difficulties on Slideroom, you may submit a document via your portal with YouTube video links. Our team may follow up to request a Slideroom submission at a later time. Should I submit other academic materials? Harvard accepts other standardized tests or other academic credentials if you choose to submit them. In any admissions process, additional information can be helpful. For example, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-levels, national leaving examinations, national or international contests, early high school assessment scores such as the PSAT or pre-ACT, or courses taken outside your school during the school year or summer are just some examples of information that could be submitted. Subject Tests and the essay portion of the SAT have been terminated, except in certain special circumstances. Harvard admission officers review all materials that an applicant submits, so if you’ve already taken Subject Tests or the essay portion of the SAT, you may still submit them along with your other application materials.

With Harvard's dual programs of study with New England Conservatory (NEC) and Berklee College of Music, you can have the best of both worlds. Programs The dual programs of study allow students to receive a bachelor's degree from Harvard College and take private lessons and preparatory classes at New England Conservatory or Berklee. Students taking part in the Harvard-NEC dual degree program will pursue a bachelor's degree at Harvard followed by a master's degree at NEC. Students taking part in the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program will complete Harvard’s bachelor’s requirements in their four years and then have the option to apply to the Berklee master's program. New England Conservatory The Harvard/NEC program is a 5-year dual degree program in which a student earns a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (S.B.) at Harvard College and a Master of Music (M.M.) at New England Conservatory. Conservatory Program Overview During your first three years, you will take studio instruction each semester at NEC, but you will focus on your academic coursework at Harvard. In your fourth year of study, you will complete your degree requirements at Harvard and begin to fulfill NEC’s Master of Music (M.M.) degree requirements, which you will finish in your fifth year of study. Admission The program is open to high school students who apply to both institutions through the normal admissions process. You must apply to both Harvard and NEC, indicating on both applications your interest in the Harvard-NEC dual degree option. If you are admitted to both institutions, you will then receive an additional decision for admission to the dual degree program.Admission to the NEC Dual Degree Program guarantees admission to the NEC Master of Music degree program. NEC does not offer an early action program but has a regular action deadline of December 1. Performance applicants will be expected to audition at NEC during the regular auditions period in February/March.Composition applicants will be expected to interview at NEC during February/March if invited after review of scores and recordings.Find out more at the Department of Music at Harvard (617-495-2791) or the Office of Admissions at New England Conservatory (617-585-1101).For more information, you may also contact:Harvard University Peter Charig, Undergraduate Program Coordinator Pcharig@fas.harvard.edu New England Conservatory of Music Richard Giarusso, Dean of Academic Affairs Richard.giarusso@necmusic.edu Berklee College of Music The Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program is designed for musicians who are interested in building a foundation for their artistic careers at Berklee, while attaining a liberal arts education at Harvard.

Students receive their undergraduate degree at Harvard after 4 years and then have the option to apply for a master’s degree at Berklee.Joint Studies students complete the full requirements of the Harvard A.B. or S.B. degree, including all general education requirements and all the requirements for the Harvard concentration of their choice. As part of their Harvard curriculum, students may take classes at Berklee. Students begin by taking private instruction on their instrument at Berklee, participating in an ensemble, and taking introductory courses that prepare them for more advanced offerings within Berklee’s curriculum. From there, students will be allowed to pursue their own interests at Berklee in consultation with Berklee and Harvard advisers. Berklee will give particular attention to preparing students for master’s programs if that is their goal. Students who are interested in pursuing a master’s program at Berklee must apply for the Berklee master’s program in their final year at Harvard.Upon graduation from the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program students receive a bachelor’s degree from Harvard but no degree from Berklee. Admission The Joint Studies program is open to high school students who apply to both institutions through the normal admissions process. You must apply to both Harvard and Berklee, indicating on both applications your interest in the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies option. If you are admitted to both institutions, you will then receive an additional decision for the Joint Studies program.Berklee students are allowed to apply early to both Harvard and Berklee.

Can I get a waiver?Can I self-report my test scores?Do I need a minimum required SAT or ACT score? Helpful Links FAQsApplicant PortalEventsContact Usmy.harvard Breadcrumb Home - Guides Application Tips We're here to help To apply for admission as a first-year or transfer student at Harvard, you will start with the Application. Fill out the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir (choose one, we have no preference), followed by the supplement to help us get a better sense of who you are. Not sure where to start? We've gathered some helpful tips on how to fill out the main application and the Harvard supplement. Profile The Profile section is a place where you'll share detailed information about yourself, including contact information, demographics, and fee waiver request. It's always a good idea to review the information here and update any details, if necessary. Please note that none of the demographic questions in this section are required. Profile Section Personal Information: Legal Name Please fill out your name exactly as it will show up on all materials we receive for your application. Your teachers, college counselors and others should also use your legal name just as it will appear on your financial aid forms, official test score reports, etc. Use of a nickname can cause your application to be incomplete if we cannot match your materials to your application. Citizenship Citizenship does not in any way affect your chances of admission or eligibility for financial aid at Harvard. There is no admissions advantage or disadvantage in being a US citizen. This is not the case at all institutions.For students who need a visa to study in the United States, this question is of critical importance: we begin to prepare the forms that qualify you for a visa immediately after acceptance. Any delay in this process can jeopardize your chances of arriving in Cambridge in time to begin the fall semester. U.S. Social Security Number Your U.S. Social Security number is kept strictly confidential and is used solely to match up your admissions and financial aid data if you are applying for aid. U.S. Armed Forces Status The applications of veterans are most welcome and your service is a positive factor in our admissions process. We’re proud to help veterans continue their education by participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program and Service to School’s VetLink program. Learn more about applying as a veteran here. Application Fee Waiver The application fee covers a very small portion of the administrative costs of processing applications. However, if the fee presents a hardship for you or your family, it will be waived. Each applicant applying with a fee waiver should select an option for a need-based fee waiver. Do not let the application fee stand in the way of applying! How to Request an Application Fee Waiver Do not let the admissions application fee prevent you from applying! In the spirit of our honor code, if the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:Common ApplicationConfirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\"Complete the fee waiver signature.Coalition ApplicationConfirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile.If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9Transfer ApplicantsPlease send an email to adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu to request a transfer application fee waiver. Family In the family section, you'll share information about your household, your parents, and any siblings. Most colleges collect this information for demographic purposes. Even if you're an adult or an emancipated minor, you'll need to fill out this section. Household Unknown Parent Answer the questions as honestly and fully as you can, but don’t worry if you and your parent/guardian do not know all of the details about your family. Family Information Part of an admissions officer’s job in reading your application is to understand your background and how these circumstances have affected your upbringing, the opportunities available to you, academic preparation, and other factors relevant to the college admissions process. Family life is an important factor in helping us to learn more about the circumstances and conditions in which you were raised, and how you have made the most of the opportunities provided by your family. We want to understand where you’re coming from, not only in school, but at home as well. Parent Education Parents almost always have a significant effect on students’ lives. Information about parents may indicate challenges you have faced – and overcome. In your essay you might elaborate on your family experiences in a wide variety of ways that can illuminate your character and personal qualities, including the positive aspects of your family life. Education In the Education section is where you will share information about your current school or coursework, academic honors, and future education plans. Here are some tips on commonly asked questions. Interruption in Education It is not uncommon for students to change schools or take time off during high school. While this information will most likely appear on your transcript, hearing directly from you about any interruption in schooling will help us to fill in any gaps. Grades We always defer to the secondary school report for information about grades. If yours is not provided by the counselor or school, we will take into consideration what is self-reported, making sure to confirm with your school officials. Current or Most Recent Year Courses Please list the courses you are currently taking and/or are planning on taking before you graduate. If your schedule changes after you have submitted your application, please keep us updated by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal. Honors & Level(s) of Recognition This is a place to highlight any achievements or awards you have received. If you receive any significant honors or awards after submitting the application, you may notify us by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal and we will include this information with your application materials. Future Plans & Career Interest You do not need to have a ten year plan, but getting a sense of what kinds of professions you have considered gives us insight into your current plans. Don’t fret about it: put a few ideas down and move on with your application. Since there are some students who do have a developed career interest already established while they are in high school, this question provides an opportunity to indicate such a plan. Testing Standardized test scores are optional for the College Classes of 2027-2030. The Testing section is where you'll enter your self-reported scores for any standardized tests that you've taken and wish to report to colleges. However, remember that if you self-report your test scores and you are admitted and choose to enroll at Harvard, you'll be required to submit your official score reports. View more information on our standardized testing requirements on our Application Requirements page. Tests Taken Test Scores We have always looked at the best scores applicants choose to submit. If you haven’t yet taken the tests and you intend to submit standardized tests, please indicate which tests you are taking and when. TOEFL The TOEFL is not required for Harvard, but if you are taking it for another college, you may elect to submit it as part of your Harvard application. Your score can be one more piece of evidence regarding your English language proficiency, so you may choose to submit it if you feel it provides additional helpful information. AP/IB Tests These exam scores are additional pieces of academic information which can help us as we think about your preparation and potential for college level work. Sometimes AP or IB scores can demonstrate a wide range of academic accomplishments.If you have the opportunity to take AP and IB exams, the results may also be helpful for academic placement, should you be accepted and choose to enroll at Harvard. Why can't I view my standardized test scores in the Common Application? Since Harvard College is not requiring applicants to submit standardized test scores for the 2022-2026 application cycles, your standardized scores will not display in the Common Application PDF preview, even if you have chosen to submit them. However, if you entered your test score information and would like it to be considered, that data will still be transmitted to us with your application and we will review it. You can verify this by viewing the Application Checklist in your Applicant Portal. You will see a green check mark if we have received your standardized test scores. Activities The activities section gives you the opportunity to tell schools more about who you are and activities you're involved with outside the classroom. You'll have the opportunity to list up to ten activities, but that doesn't mean you need to enter all ten. How we use extracurricular activities and work experience in the admissions process We are much more interested in the quality of students’ activities than their quantity so do not feel you need to fill in the entire grid! Contributions students make to the well-being of their secondary schools, communities and families are of great interest to us. So indicate for us the time you spend and the nature of the contribution to extracurricular activities, the local community, work experiences and help provided to your family. Activities you undertake need not be exotic but rather might show a commitment to excellence regardless of the activity. Such a commitment can apply to any activity in your life and may reflect underlying character and personal qualities. For example, a student can gain a great deal from helping his or her family with babysitting or other household responsibilities or working in a restaurant to help with family or personal expenses. Such experiences are important “extracurricular” activities and can be detailed in the extracurricular section and discussed in essays. Some students list only activities they feel will appear significant to the admissions office, while others endeavor to list every single thing they have ever done. Neither approach is right for everyone. Rather, you should think about the activities (in-school, at home, or elsewhere) that you care most about and devote most of your time doing, and list those. We realize that extracurricular and athletic opportunities are either unavailable or limited at many high schools. We also know that limited economic resources in many families can affect a student’s chances for participation on the school teams, travel teams, or even prevent participation at all due to the costs of the equipment or the logistical requirements of some sports and activities. You should not feel that your chances for admission to college are hindered by the lack of extracurricular opportunities. Rather, our admissions committee will look at the various kinds of opportunities you have had in your lifetime and try to assess how well you have taken advantage of those opportunities. For additional thoughts on extracurricular activities, please refer to this 2009 article in the New York Times: Guidance Office: Answers From Harvard’s Dean, Part 3. Positions held, honors won, letters earned, or employer In this section, please describe the activity and your level of participation. Please note that your description should be concise, or it may be cut off by the Common Application. Participation Grade Level The grades during which you have participated are important because they help us to understand the depth of your involvement in that activity and your changing interests over time. Not all extracurricular activities must be a four-year commitment for our applicants. Approximate Time Spent We are interested to know how you manage your time and to understand how you balance your life outside of the classroom. Some students dedicate their time to one or two activities, while others spread their time among many. When did you participate We know that students are often active both during the school year and the summer – working, babysitting siblings, enrolling in courses, traveling, playing sports, holding internships, etc. Distinguishing school-year activities from summer activities helps us understand how you have spent your time and taken advantage of opportunities available to you. Plans to participate in college? Harvard is a residential institution, and our students are actively engaged in college life. This section helps us to understand how you might contribute at Harvard. Some students who were involved in several activities during high school choose to narrow their focus in college and/or to try new activities not previously available. What if there's not enough space? Filling out the grid is an act of prioritization: your responses tell us what activities or work experiences are most meaningful to you. And there’s quite a bit of space there, too; almost everyone should be able to convey the breadth and depth of out-of-class commitments on the application. Conversely, please do not feel a need to fill every line! Writing The first section is the personal essay. Harvard requires the submission of the personal essay with your application. We also offer an opportunity to add any additional information. Personal Essay The Common Application essay topics are broad. Please note that Coalition essay questions may differ. While this might seem daunting at first, look at it as an opportunity to write about something you care about, rather than what you think the Admissions Committee wants to hear. The point of the personal statement is for you to have the chance to share whatever you would like with us. Remember, your topic does not have to be exotic to be compelling.Essay topics include:Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you? Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design. Additional Information Do not feel obligated to fill this space, but some students have used this opportunity to tell us about challenging circumstances in their lives such as illness or other difficulties that may have affected their grades. Any information that can tell us more about the person behind the test scores and grades can be helpful. Harvard Questions Each college or university that is a member of the Common Application and/or the Coalition Application - Powered by Scoir has an opportunity to ask applicants a series of school-specific questions separate from the common part of the application. The Harvard supplement contains a series of questions that help us learn more about your academic, extracurricular, and personal interests. You application is not considered complete until you submit the supplement. General: Applying for Financial Aid Harvard has a need-blind admissions process and applying for aid is never detrimental to your admissions decision. We ask this question because we want to be able to calculate your financial need in advance of our April notification date so that we can send your admission letter and financial aid offer at the same time. One thing to note – not all institutions have such policies. General: Submitting Supplementary Materials Supplementary materials (art slides, music recordings, research papers, etc.) help when they reveal unusual talent. You absolutely do not have to include anything supplementary to gain acceptance to Harvard, and the vast majority of admitted students do not submit supplementary materials with their applications. You can submit art and media files through Slideroom and any documents or articles directly in the Applicant Portal with an uploader tool. Academics: Fields of Study When you select from the full list of Harvard's academic concentrations, you give us a sense of the direction you may choose when it comes time for you to choose a concentration at Harvard in your sophomore year.While we realize that this question is quite similar to the one asked on the Common Application, our own format allows us to fit this information into data fields that Harvard has been collecting for many years. While we know students might well change their minds once they are in college, it is helpful for us to get a sense of their current interests and those academic areas in which they have already spent time and effort.We do not admit students into specific academic programs, and we have no quotas or targets for academic fields. Academics: Future Plans As a liberal arts institution with fifty academic concentrations and more than 450 extracurricular organizations, we expect and encourage our students to explore new opportunities. We understand that as you answer these questions, you may not be entirely sure of your plans, but this information helps us to understand how you might use Harvard. Activities One of the principal ways students meet and educate each other during college is through extracurricular activities. Your answer to this question gives us a better sense of the interests you might bring to college and how definite your academic, vocational, extracurricular or athletic interests might be. This information helps us understand better how you might use Harvard. Of course, one of the best things about a liberal arts education is that plans may change. There is no “right” answer to these questions. Contacts If you have applied to Harvard before, we want to include your previous application with your current one. We also want to have a record of any other involvement at Harvard you may have had, including the Summer School and the Extension School and associated transcripts. This information adds to the context of your present application. It can be helpful for us to note changes in your application—perhaps areas where you have strengthened the academic and/or extracurricular aspects of your candidacy. Writing Supplement The supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world. Required Short Answer Questions Each question has a 200 word limit. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard?Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are.How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future?Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.

Please note that we don't start sending application acknowledgment emails until mid-September, so if you submit your application very early, you may not receive the email until this time. In the portal, you can: Update your email address, mailing address and other contact information View your personalized application checklist Confirm the testing information we have received Change your financial aid application status If submitting scores, self-report your test scores Change your application round (Restrictive Early Action to Regular Decision) Upload additional documents and materials Withdraw your application Have a Conversation with an Alumni Interviewer Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview. It is not possible to request an interview and we are not able to conduct interviews in Cambridge. If you are contacted by an alumnus/a about scheduling an interview, we hope you will accept this invitation. Ordinarily, your interviewer will reach out to you by email to arrange a time for this conversation. Whether you attend high school in the US or internationally, we try to connect you with an alumnus/a from your area, although this is not always possible. Alumni interviewers usually reach out via their own personal email address or by phone. Should you like to verify that person’s affiliation with the Harvard College Interviewing Program, please call 617-495-1551 or write to college@fas.harvard.edu. Interviews may be conducted via Zoom (or other video conferencing platform), telephone, or in-person depending on public health restrictions in your area - as well as your preferences and those of your interviewer. It is important to note that our alumni interviewers do not have access to your application – they only have your name, your contact information and the name of your high school. Any recording of this conversation is strictly prohibited. A few tips: For virtual interviews, it is best to use a computer for this video conversation and not your cell phone. If this is not possible, let our alumni interviewer know of your constraints and we will do our best to accommodate your circumstances. Alternatively, your interview could be conducted by phone. Be aware of your background and consider using appropriate virtual or neutral options. Try to find a quiet room or space for this conversation and make sure there is no one else in the room. These conversations are always best if you have the opportunity to engage with your alumni interviewer without the distraction of a third party presence. Be yourself and use this opportunity to learn more about the Harvard community from someone who has been a Harvard student. There is no need to dress in formal attire. Consider wearing something you would wear to school. Viewing Your Decision Most importantly, the Applicant Portal is where you'll view your admissions decision. Most applicants receive an email reminding them to check their portal and view their decision about 15 minutes after decisions are released. However, if you are logged in to the portal at the time that decisions are released, you may not receive this email. When you log in, you'll see a crimson-colored banner with \"Status Update\".

The past admissions cycle – for the Class of 2026 – was the second cycle that students have been able to apply to Harvard without requiring standardized testing, as many students continued to have limited access to testing sites due to COVID-19. Consistent with Harvard’s whole-person admissions process, standardized tests are one factor among many considered. Accomplishments in and out of the classroom during the high school years – including extracurricular activities, community involvement, employment, and family responsibilities – are considered as part of the admissions process. Students who do not submit standardized test scores will not be disadvantaged in their application process. Applicants will be considered on the basis of what they have presented, and students are encouraged to send whatever materials they believe would convey their accomplishments in secondary school and their promise for the future.

You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores as well as Advanced Placement or other scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment.If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.

You can afford Harvard In just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well.

U.S. Military veterans may be particularly interested in our transfer program if they've completed at least one full academic year, and not more than two, of college coursework. Transfer FAQs Do transfer students qualify for financial aid? Yes. All transfer applicants, including international students, are eligible to apply for need-based financial aid. Transfer applicants should follow the prospective student financial aid application instructions. How are transfer students supported on campus? Enrolling students take part in a fall orientation program and are connected with a dedicated transfer adviser who helps with academic planning and the transition to Harvard life. Transfer students who live on-campus will find strong community in their undergraduate Houses, and students who live off campus will benefit from the Dudley Community. Transfer students are also supported by peer advisers, who were themselves transfer students from prior years. What courses transfer to Harvard College? Is there a list of transferrable courses? The Harvard College Registrar's Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. The admissions office does not keep a list of transferrable courses and cannot advise on this matter during the application process. Harvard College typically accepts courses taken while enrolled as a full-time student in an undergraduate program similar to our liberal arts curriculum. The Committee also looks for strong preparation in the student's expected field of specialization. Can I concentrate in business, journalism, law, or medicine? While you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students. I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me? The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here. About Our Transfer Program Each fall, we welcome a very small number (12 on average) of transfer students to Harvard College. We seek students whose previous academic experience will prepare them to flourish in our rigorous and rewarding liberal arts program. In our candidates for transfer admission, we look for: A clearly defined academic need to transfer A proven record of achievement at your current institution Strong faculty recommendations Recently, we have received more than 1,500 transfer applications per year. In pools of this size, the number of well-qualified applicants far exceeded the number of students admitted and enrolled each year as transfer students. As admission to transfer to Harvard is competitive, we encourage you to explore a variety of colleges in your transfer search. Eligibility To be eligible to transfer, you must have completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, and not more than two academic years, by the time you would be enrolling at Harvard. You must complete at least two full years of study at Harvard. Once a student has completed more than two years total of college at another institution, regardless of courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission.Students are eligible to transfer only from a liberal arts curriculum that is similar to Harvard’s. Candidates whose education has been in a vocational, professional, technical, online, extension, or performance program will not ordinarily qualify for transfer admission.Students who have completed one full-time year of college in a regular degree program in lieu of their senior year of high school (often referred to as dual enrollment) should apply for first-year admission if these courses are taken for credit towards a high school diploma.Students who are enrolled part-time are not eligible unless they have previously completed one full-time, continuous academic year.If you are too advanced in your studies to qualify for transfer, you may be interested in the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program.No student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the 12 Harvard University graduate schools. The Harvard College Admissions Office is independent of these schools and their admissions policies. Take a Virtual Tour Use our Virtual Tour to discover spaces that aren't even available on an in-person campus tour, such as classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and more. Explore Harvard What We Look For Through our admissions process, we strive to give you ample opportunities to best demonstrate your interests and accomplishments. We welcome candidates who have gone directly from high school into college as well as those who have followed less traditional paths. The Admissions Committee looks for achievement in a rigorous program of study, especially in your expected field of specialization. Beyond strong grades, test scores, and recommendations, the Committee considers other non-academic factors such as significant extracurricular engagements and talents. We also consider an applicant’s personal qualities such as a capacity for leadership, creativity, resiliency, intellectual curiosity, and independent thinking. In addition to our standard application materials, you may submit supplementary materials showcasing exceptional or unusual talents, including musical performance, artistic work, and research material. Learn more about what we look for Timeline Harvard accepts transfer students for fall semester entrance only; we do not admit students for the spring semester. The transfer application becomes available during the fall of the academic year. March 1: Deadline for all transfer application and financial aid materials. The Transfer Admissions Committee begins to review applications after the application deadline. We will notify applicants of admissions decisions in June. Submitting your materials early does not increase your chances of admission, but it does provide more opportunities to track down any missing documents and ensure that your application is full and complete by the time we begin our review. Please note that college transcripts should be sent between January and March in order to reflect your most updated academic credentials.

Transferring Course Credit Harvard will honor comparable coursework you have done prior to your transfer admission, while also giving you time to take advantage of Harvard’s course offerings and delve deeply into your concentration. You will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 16 semester-long courses—the equivalent of two full years of academic work—providing you the opportunity to take the remaining half of the courses required for your A.B. or S.B. degree at Harvard. The Harvard College Registrar’s Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. While Harvard does not audit transcripts prior to application to determine eligibility, the descriptions below should be helpful in determining which of your courses may transfer. Our office is unable to make recommendations in regards to coursework at your current institution or advise on anticipated class standing during the application process. Which courses are eligible for credit? You may receive credit for courses taken in a full-time, daytime program of study at an accredited degree-granting institution, provided that you: Took courses comparable to those offered in Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum. Earned grades of “C” (or the equivalent) or better Which courses are not eligible for credit? Unfortunately, we are unable to grant credit for certain accomplishments. Harvard does not typically award credit for: Online or distance education courses Night or extension courses Courses taken on a part-time basis Technical or vocational courses such as accounting, marketing, journalism, law, agriculture, nursing, business, communications or specialized military training coursework Dual-enrollment courses counted for credit toward a high school diploma Work done prior to admission in an isolated term, semester or quarter at another college, unless the college from which you are transferring has granted credit for that work Credit gained by accelerating in an academic year at another college College Level Placement Exam (CLEP), Advanced Placement Exam (AP/IB) results, or any credit earned by examination, even when credited to your degree by the college or university from which you wish to transfer Summer school courses, except for those at your current college/university or courses at Harvard Summer School Contacting Transfer Admissions The Transfer Admissions team will be available to answer questions by email at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu Monday through Friday between the hours of 9am and 5pm ET.

Our admissions and financial aid processes are the same for all applicants - regardless of nationality or citizenship. Frequently asked questions How do international students apply? The application requirements are the same for all applicants whether a student attends high school inside or outside the U.S. All first-year candidates must complete the Common Application or the Coalition Application along with the required supplements. We have no preference and each application is treated equally by the Admissions Committee. View our detailed application requirements here. Do I have to take the TOEFL? A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. First-year and transfer applicants are not required to take an English proficiency exam, but you may submit scores if you wish to do so. Visiting Undergraduate Students program applicants are required to take the TOEFL. Are there quotas for international applicants? There are no quotas or limits of any kind at any point in the admissions process. All students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the secondary school they attend. A student's chances for admission and financial aid are not affected by citizenship or by the location of the school that the student attends. Does Harvard offer admission application fee waivers to international students? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver directly through the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, if you meet their respective indicators of economic need. If you do not meet these indicators, please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived. Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way. Will Harvard provide travel expenses for international students who receive financial aid? All students, American and international, who are on financial aid have a travel allowance included in their financial aid award to help cover the cost of travel to and from Cambridge. Overseas students are advised to seek information from the nearest U.S. Cultural Affairs Office about travel grants and other financial assistance available to qualified students from various foundations and from the U.S. government. Common Questions We are often asked by prospective students, “Do you count me as an international applicant?” Because all applicants follow the same procedures and timetables and are eligible for the same financial aid, we do not need to categorize individual applicants as either international or domestic. We have foreign citizens applying from American high schools and American citizens applying from high schools around the world. When we refer to “international admissions,” we are generally referring to applicants who apply from schools outside the United States as the documentation submitted by those schools may differ substantially from that submitted by an American high school and may require specialized knowledge. Please note that we do not have quotas or limits based on either citizenship or location of high school. Furthermore, admissions decisions are made without regard to whether an applicant has applied for financial aid, even if the applicant is a foreign citizen. The Harvard Club of the UK has created a website to answer specific questions for those applying from the United Kingdom. You may find it a useful source of supplemental information. Learn More - International Brochure Financial Aid Our financial aid policies are the same for all applicants, regardless of nationality or citizenship.

Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment.If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.

You can afford Harvard In just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.* *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

Their extraordinary range of talent and many contributions to their communities will add immeasurably to Harvard over the next four years and beyond,” said Admissions and Financial Aid Dean William R. Fitzsimmons. Students deferred in Early Action will be considered again in the regular decision cycle. That deadline is Jan. 1, and those applicants will receive decisions in late March. This year’s Early Action pool marks a return to numbers consistent with pre-pandemic sizes. Today’s acceptances come after the Griffin Financial Aid Office’s recent expansion of its robust support of students. The establishment of a new launch grant gives students receiving full financial support – those whose annual family income is $85,000 or less — $2,000 in the fall of their junior year to help with the costs associated with getting ready for post-Harvard life. Since 2016, incoming students on full support have been eligible for similar start-up grants to help smooth their transition to campus. “Our terrific financial aid program, especially with the new launch grant, is able to provide even more support to students who need it most. Financial support combined with resources like those provided through the Mignone Center for Career Success make it possible for all students to follow their goals during and after Harvard,” said Jake Kaufmann, Griffin Director of Financial Aid. Of the Class of 2028’s accepted Early Action cohort, 15.5 percent come from first-generation college backgrounds, compared with about 14 percent last year. Additionally, 20.8 percent had their application fees waived due to financial need compared with 19.7 percent last year. This year, Harvard joined STORY (Small Town Outreach, Recruitment, and Yield), a new consortium of 30 public and private universities working to raise the awareness in rural communities about opportunities at Harvard and similar institutions. The STORY consortium traveled to five locations in the South and Midwest this fall to speak with students, families, and high school college counselors about the admissions process and financial aid. Students from rural communities and small towns make up 10 percent of accepted students to date. Among accepted students so far, 22.3 percent are from New England, 20.8 percent are from the mid-Atlantic, 14.5 percent are from the South, 8.4 percent are from the Midwest, 17.2 percent are from the West, and nearly 17 percent are from outside the United States. Applicants for the Class of 2028 were the first to experience Harvard’s reorganized application supplement. Harvard removed the single optional essay in which students could select from 10 suggested topics, and replaced it with required short answer questions, all of which were previously optional short answers or suggested supplemental essay topics. Requiring students to respond to each question ensures that the admission committee has consistent information to review across applicants. The questions ask students to reflect on their own experiences, intellectual interests, plans after college, and living with others. “We continue to attract applications from a diverse range of secondary schools and communities around the world. Students have responded well to this year’s essay questions, using them to share their passions and hopes for the future. We look forward to seeing what these students contribute to the community once they are here,” said Director of Admissions Joy St. John. Harvard College continues to allow students to apply without requiring SAT or ACT scores, a change in policy announced three years ago for the admitted classes of 2026-2030. Students were notified of Early Action decisions at 7 p.m. Thursday. Those admitted are not obligated to attend and have until May 1 to make their final decision. The deadline to apply for regular decision is 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Jan. 1. Harvard College will welcome accepted students to campus for Visitas weekend April 14-15. At that time, the Class of 2028 is invited to attend classes and events as well as learn about resources and opportunities. Students will receive information about Visitas and Crimson Connect via the Admitted Student Website.

Our commitment to affordability We want to make sure that MIT is an affordable option for all of our admitted students. Our financial aid team works closely with you and your family to develop a plan tailored to your financial circumstances, so that you can attend MIT and cover your expenses while you’re here. How to apply Applying for financial aid can be complicated, so we have broken it down to make it a bit easier. Before we can decide what your financial aid award looks like, we need to know what your financial situation is. To do this, we use three documents that paint us a detailed picture of what kind of aid you’ll need to be able to attend MIT affordably. Four steps to apply for aid CSS Profile: a tool provided by the College Board that we use to determine if you qualify for a need-based MIT Scholarship Create your FSA ID: If you plan to fill out the FAFSA you need to create or reconfirm your Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) as soon as possible. Beginning this year, students and parents are not able to share an account on the Federal Student Aid site. If you are a student, parent, or other contributor, you need to create your own account. Once completed, it will take 5 business days for your account to be activated before you can fill out the FAFSA. See details on how to fill our your FAFSA below. FAFSA: the form you need to fill out to see if you are eligible for any federal or state student aid. See our FAQs for answers to common questions about the FAFSA and learn more on how to fill our your FAFSA below. Parental tax returns or income documentation: your parents’ tax returns or income documentation must be submitted through the College Board’s secure IDOC platform Start your application → Estimate your federal aid If you would like to get a sense of how much federal student aid you may be eligible for, you can complete the Federal Student Aid Estimator. It takes about 10 minutes, and you can do this before filling out the FAFSA. You will need your family’s financial information, including tax filing status, adjusted gross income, total assets, and any annual child support received. More about each of the pieces we use to determine aid CSS Profile The CSS Profile is a tool provided by the College Board that we use to determine if you qualify for an MIT Scholarship. For the application, you will need the following: Your parents’ 2022 income tax returns or wage statements Any other records of money earned Bank statements Records of investments Records of untaxed income Designate MIT as one of your recipients by using our CSS code 3514 and answer all supplemental questions specific to MIT. If the fee presents a challenge, it may be waived by the College Board. MIT is not able to offer a fee waiver directly. If your parents are separated or divorced, each parent will need to complete their own CSS Profile application. Fill out the CSS Profile → FAFSA The U.S. government determines the amount of federal student aid—grants, loans, and work-study—you qualify for using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The 2024–2025 FAFSA is now available. Domestic students should submit it as soon as they are able. Create your FSA ID now: Create or reconfirm your Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) as soon as possible. Beginning this year, students and parents are not able to share an account on the Federal Student Aid site. If you are a student, parent, or other contributor, you need to create your own account. Once completed, it will take 5 business days for your account to be activated before you can fill out the FAFSA. You need the following to create an account: Your Social Security Number (SSN): If a contributor does not have an SSN, they may still create an FSA ID—however, this feature is not yet available. We will update these directions when more information becomes available. Your own email address and/or mobile phone number For the application, you will need: Your parents’ 2022 federal income tax returns and W-2s Other records of money earned Current bank account balances Records of investments Records of untaxed income Please designate MIT as one of your recipients using Federal Code 002178. If you are asked to verify your FAFSA, this means that you may need to take a few extra steps to confirm your financial information. You can learn more about verification here. Fill out the FAFSA → Parental tax returns or income documentation After submitting the CSS Profile, you will need to submit your parents’ tax returns or income documentation to the College Board’s secure Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) for processing. If your parents do not file a tax return, please complete the Non Tax Filer Statement through IDOC and submit it along with documentation of income (W-2, 1099, or a letter from their employer outside the U.S.). For the application, you will need: Your parents’ 2022 federal (not state) tax returns along with all schedules, statements, and W-2s. Veterans of the U.S. armed forces are exempt from this step. If your family owns a corporation or interest in a partnership, you must send the corporation or partnership tax return through IDOC. Please note that a Schedule K-1 is insufficient data, as the complete tax returns are needed. If you, your parents, or other siblings are beneficiaries of an estate or trust, submit the appropriate Schedule K-1 of IRS Form 1041 or IRS Form 4970 through IDOC. If your parents are separated or divorced, your non-custodial parent’s tax return is required as well. If your parents live outside the U.S., please provide the tax return from that country, along with a translation to English if applicable. You must submit all documents directly to IDOC. We will be unable to accept anything sent directly to MIT. Please note: It can take up to two weeks for the tax returns to be received by MIT. Submit parental documentation → Need help?

If you are a citizen of a foreign country, you may apply for fall entry (September) only. For fall entry (September), we must receive your final application with all supporting documents by March 15, 2024. Spring ENTRY October 15, 2023: Spring semester application deadline Mid-November: Applicants for spring semester are notified of admissions decisions Mid-December: Deadline for enrollment for admitted spring semester transfer students Fall ENTRY March 15, 2024: Fall semester application deadline Early May: Applicants for fall semester are notified of admissions decisions Early June: Deadline for enrollment for admitted fall semester transfer students Evaluations We require two academic evaluations from college professors or instructors. We recommend that one evaluation be from a math or science instructor. We find that the best recommendations are written by professors who know an applicant well as both a student and a person. You are also welcome (but not required) to submit two supplemental letters of recommendation from high school teachers, employers, etc. School Official Report We also require a School Official Report from your advisor, registrar, or another school official. Applicants are encouraged to use the electronic form built into the MIT transfer application to request the School Official Report. If a hard copy of the form is required by your current (or most recent) institution, you can download a PDF version of the School Official Report. The school official should submit the completed report to [email protected], by fax to 617.687.9174, or by mail to MIT Admissions. Transcripts Transfer applicants are required to upload a copy of their transcripts within the MIT transfer application from each institution they have attended—including all secondary/high schools, colleges, and universities. Official transcripts are only required for transfer students who are admitted and choose to enroll at MIT. Standardized tests We require the SAT or the ACT for both first year and transfer applicants. We do not require the ACT writing section or the SAT optional essay. We accept both the paper and digital SAT. In order to apply for transfer admission, you must take the required tests before October 31 for spring entry, and before March 31 for fall entry. Superscoring If a student takes the same test multiple times, we will consider the highest score achieved in each section. We do this in order to consider all applicants in their best light. Please note that our office will verify scores for all enrolling students. Any discrepancies between official and self-reported scores may affect a student’s offer of admission.

What’s the difference? Only the dates of the deadlines! It is fine to apply during either cycle. We do not have a preference, and there is no strategic benefit to applying in one vs the other. We have two cycles for two reasons: 1) it helps us spread our work out over a longer period, devoting more time to each application, and 2) it provides applicants with more options so they can choose which works best for them. Rules and restrictions Early Action is an option for all applicants, domestic and international. Our Early Action isn’t single-choice, binding, or anything like that. If you choose to apply to MIT during Early Action, we do not place any limits on where else you may apply, nor do we require you to attend if admitted (though we sure hope you do!). However, if you apply to another school during Early Action that does have a restriction, MIT requires that you respect those rules. So for example, if you apply to another school that is “single choice”— meaning that you can only apply there during the early period—you may not simultaneously apply to MIT, and if you’re admitted somewhere “binding,” then even if we admit you, you must go there instead. So choose wisely! One application per entry year You’re only allowed to apply once per entry year. Students who are denied Early Action are not eligible to apply Regular Action.

If you are still in high school, you are considered a first-year applicant regardless of how many classes you may have taken at the university or college level. The transfer application is closed in the MIT application portal. One application per entry year Transfer students may only submit one application per entry year, meaning if you apply to enter in the spring term, you cannot reapply for the fall term of the same calendar year. (For example, if you apply for the spring 2024 term, you cannot also apply for the fall 2024 term, because both terms occur in the same entry year.) If you are a citizen of a foreign country, you may apply for fall (September) entry only. Term eligibility Minimum of two terms of full-time study Students who will have completed at least two terms of study with high academic standing at an accredited college, university, technical institute, or community college may apply for transfer admission. If you are in your first year of college, the earliest you can apply to transfer to MIT is during your second term of study. Maximum of five terms of full-time study Students who at the time of entry to MIT will have completed more than two and a half years (i.e., five terms) of college may not be eligible because of our residency requirements. If you have been enrolled in college part-time, you should calculate your full-time term equivalency in order to estimate your eligibility. Keep in mind that eligibility will be assessed by the Admissions Committee in the application review process. MIT does not award second bachelor’s degrees MIT does not award second bachelor’s degrees—even if you are interested in pursuing a different field of study from the bachelor’s degree you hold. If you are ineligible for either first-year or transfer admissions, you may consider MIT’s opportunities for graduate education, open learning, or professional education.

'07 my advice on application essays (updated 7/29) July 26, 2005 in Admissions, Advice, Process & Statistics So on the MyMIT Admissions site, the 2005-2006 undergraduate application has been posted. You can request a paper copy, download a PDF, or view an online version. I sent my printed-out-PDF application via snail mail, but that was back before MIT had the technology in place for online applications. (What???) I’m hesitant to dole out reams of application advice, but there is one thing that I am confident in recommending to you. (And you just thought I was quoting yet another song ruined by American Idol for fun.) “You can’t make MIT love you if you don’t [write a good essay] You can’t put on your resume things that you don’t [do] Here in 3-107, in these final hours They won’t like your essay if they don’t feel the power, But you won’t No, you won’t…” What do I mean? Well, first, there are the basic things: + use correct grammar, spelling, punctuation + make it legible (neat handwriting or “normal” font) + address the topic + stay reasonably within the word limit Also: + write about something that truly matters to you, no matter how nontraditional it may seem + take risks + be truthful + be fearless + you are awesome! be yourself And with a wheelbarrow full of salt, I remind myself of the wise words of My So-Called Life‘s Angela Chase: “People always say how you should be yourself, like ‘yourself’ is this definite thing, like a toaster or something. Like you can know what it is, even. But every so often, I’ll have like, a moment, when just being myself in my life, right where I am, is like, enough.” So go forth, ’10 applicants, and best of luck! ———– (My sincerest apologies to Bonnie Raitt, Tim Berners-Lee, and Marshall Herskovitz. It was for a good cause.) ———– 7/29 EDIT I don’t think the admissions office has a strict rule about word limits. When I applied, I made sure all of my essays were within word limits, and yeah, it wasn’t great to cut out phrases or clauses just to save on words, but I did it and felt like my essays were still meaningful. I know other people who didn’t want to sacrifice meaning for a word limit, so they went over — some by 5 words, some by 105 words. Unfortunately, there’s no “real” answer to this question, but if you think it’s too long, it’s probably too long. As for the relative importance of the essay, there’s no exact answer, but in my opinion, we care *a lot.* MIT doesn’t assign each component of the application a specific weight, and then calculate your “grade.” Rather, we consider an entire application at once, which helps us evaluate you as a person and not just the sum of your parts. I personally feel the essay is the most important part of your application, since you have the chance to open up about something that matters to you. Also, you can share with us something special that would add to your application file but wouldn’t fit or would be under-explained otherwise. Don’t stress out about your essay, since we don’t have a standard type or model that we look for when reading them. Yes, the essay is important, but it’s hard to make your writing more heartfelt and personal if you revise it to death. Be yourself (the toaster, remember?) and let the words flow.

Sam says: July 26, 2005 at 6:08 am Wow, that’s gotta be one of the greatest songs ever written for a blog entry, ever. I mean, not just on mitblogs, but on any blog. I think my favorite line is, “They won’t like your essay if they don’t feel the power”–it’s so personal and heartbreaking. Although, it doesn’t diminish the quality of the rest of the song just because that one is so good. Antti Hallavo says: July 27, 2005 at 11:16 am I’ll second what Eric said. Thanks for the great blog, Mitra. -Antti Hallavo Mitra says: July 26, 2005 at 11:17 am Ugh, not another mistake. Can anyone catch a third? Brian Burg says: July 26, 2005 at 11:44 am Well, one error might be your usage of +’s as bullets for an unordered list. That’s not semantically correct for a page layout (and somewhat ironic with the W3C being based at MIT). But, you did apologize to Tim Berners-Lee, so I guess it all evens out.

Stephanie says: July 26, 2005 at 8:19 am Hey Mitra, I’m pretty sure they actually did have online applications. At least for part of the application.

Hope your summer is rocking, see you in the fall! -Stephanie Eric Asava-Aree says: July 27, 2005 at 8:46 am Hmmm… It’s a great piece of advice, Mitra. I’ve been reading your blog for quite a while, and so thanks for all the great entries you’ve written! It’s given me another perspective to look at my ’10 application to MIT. Jane says: July 27, 2005 at 10:17 am Hullo. I’ve been lurking around the blogs for a little while. I’m applying to MIT for 2010. Great number really. Bet people are already planning hacks based on the 2010 Space Oddessey… Anyway, I have recently discovered that I am quite a worrier. I know I am unneccessarily worrying about application essays. I’m so nervous about it that I’m having trouble writing them, which makes me even more nervous. I was wondering…any of you hardworking people have advice on how to stop worrying so much about essays? rAnDom says: July 28, 2005 at 11:11 am Are you still looking for designs for your blog? Bryan says: July 28, 2005 at 1:20 am Great entry, Mitra. To all you MIT 2010 hopefuls, I echo all of Mitra’s advice. Like she said, be yourself. Take a minute/hour/day/week to think about what it is you want to say in your essay, and then write about that. Best of luck, Bryan 2010 applicant says: July 28, 2005 at 2:22 am Is 30 words over reasonably within the word limit? Eric Asava-Aree says: July 28, 2005 at 4:30 am To jane: I’m not so worried about my essays, but perhaps it’s becoz I talk to my form teacher a lot about it. You could try that too. Sulinya says: July 28, 2005 at 10:41 am Hey Mitra Thanks for the advice- though how much does MIT care about the essays relative to the other parts of the application? Sulinya says: July 28, 2005 at 10:43 am Hey Mitra! Thanks for the advice! How much does MIT value essays relative to the whole application package? Diamond says: July 29, 2005 at 11:06 am Hi guys! Yep, 2010 is good but we want to apply earlier. Is there anybody wishin’ to apply 2005 or 2006? Sure we’ll make a deal, and help each other! Mitra says: July 28, 2005 at 11:52 am Hey guys, Good questions about essay length and relative weight. I’ll edit my entry to address these points. -mitra Omar says: July 29, 2005 at 3:39 am Hey, it’s been a long time since I don’t visit the blog, and now I come while getting ready to start filling my MIT Application, to find out that you’ve just answered one of my questions. Thanks! I really hope that you keep up the great work. Hopefully I’ll see you later Omar says: July 29, 2005 at 4:08 am PS: I want you to know that I am really… not scared, but kind of anxious because I’m not good at writting essays, and well, I am concerned about the fact that I know how important it is to write an essay, but I don’t know how to write an essay that address one topic and at the same time makes the admission staff know who I am. It’s something really complex for me that I am better with numbers than words. Eric Asava-Aree says: July 30, 2005 at 6:16 am What’s with the Online Applications and Tracking link? Every time I click on it, I get this message: An application error occured at approximately Sat Jul 30 18:13:14 EDT 2005 (java.lang.NullPointerException). The date obviously keeps changing whenever I try to click on it another date. Anybody knows what’s going on? Omar E. Fernandez says: July 31, 2005 at 10:48 am it still happens? I had been working on my application and received no error. Have you tried changing the PC or the internet browser? Eric Asava-Aree says: August 1, 2005 at 7:05 am Yeah, I’ve been trying on all sorts of computers. At home, at school; all of them don’t work. Sigh… Okay, I think I’ll change browser.

I also apologize for any rambling; I’m a bit tired right now. You mention that the word limits are not rigid and dependent on the essay itself. I’m in a bit of a bind. I wrote short (the 100-word) essays that I thought reflected my own character, gave details, were mildly entertaining to a reader, and showed how much I researched and loved MIT (Over the course of RSI I started to love it more and more). Problem: One essay comes to 151 words, another to ~183 words. I can hack maybe a few tens of words from each, but after that, I start losing content. 1) How bad is this, 2) What are acceptable essay length bounds, and 3) What should I scrimp on first? Details, research into + love for MIT, what? Thanks Yimin says: August 17, 2005 at 9:21 am What is interview like? Yimin Rachael says: August 23, 2005 at 1:20 am Thank you for the tips!

Women Take the Reel The annual Women Take the Reel film festival is a collaborative effort among Women’s and Gender Studies departments that features films directed by women and about issues relating to gender, race, sexuality, class, and/or feminism. The focus is on intellectual investigation of these issues as well as visibility for woman-identifying directors, and so every film is accompanied by a Q&A and discussion with either the film director, producer, relevant organization, or a faculty member from the film screening’s host institution.
