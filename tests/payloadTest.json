M.S.E.: If TOEFL is required, a minimum of 28 on the speaking subsection is required. Program Offerings Ph.D. M.S.E. Program Offering: Ph.D. Program description The doctoral program in computer science combines coursework and participation in original research. Most students enter the program with an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related discipline. Some entering students may have a master’s degree, but that is not necessary for success in the program. Every admitted Ph.D. student is given financial support in the form of a first-year fellowship. In addition, all admitted Ph.D. students are automatically considered for the prestigious Wu and Upton Fellowships. Courses In preparation for the general examination, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with a faculty adviser, develops an integrated program of study in one of the departmental areas of research. Such preparation usually requires two academic years for students entering with a bachelor’s degree, and one year for students entering with a master’s. Students are required to stand for the general examination at the end of the second year. A total of 6 courses are required. Three courses must be taken to satisfy the core breadth requirement, with one course from each of three main areas of computer science: Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Theory.  All students must fulfill the core breadth requirements plus one additional course by the end of the second year, demonstrating minimum competence in three main areas. The remaining three courses can be any 400- or 500-level course from any department in the University. Courses taken outside the Department of Computer Science require approval from the student’s academic adviser and the Director of Graduate Studies. All courses must be taken for a grade. A grade of B+ or higher is required to get credit towards course requirements, although at most one B will be accepted for a course that does not satisfy the core breadth requirements. Individual research areas may request additional courses in excess of departmental requirements or may require students in that subfield to complete specific required courses in fulfillment of course requirements. Breadth requirement core course list: Systems 475 Computer Architecture (See ELE 475) 518 Advanced Computer Systems 561 Advanced Computer Networks 563 Wireless Networks Artificial Intelligence 511 Theoretical Machine Learning 513 Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling 524 Fundamentals of Machine Learning 529 Advanced Computer Vision 584 Advanced Natural Language Processing Theory 510 Program Languages 516 Automated Reasoning About Software 521 Advanced Algorithm Design 522 Computational Complexity 585 Information Theory and Applications General exam The general examination consists of a research seminar prepared under the supervision of a faculty member, followed by an in-depth oral examination on the contents of the seminar and the associated general area of research. The oral examination tests the student's knowledge in a number of topics relevant to the student's research area. These topics are specified beforehand by an examining committee in consultation with the student. The seminar is open to the public, and at least three computer science faculty members must attend. Two are invited by the student; the adviser chooses a  third faculty member who could be in any area of Computer Science or related fields.  The examining committee and the student agree upon a reading list for the exam. This document is to be made available to anyone present in the oral examination, and only questions pertaining to either the material described in the document or presented during the research seminar can be asked during the oral examination. Original research results do not have to be presented, but problems whose solution may lead to a thesis should be discussed. In many cases, the student’s thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required. Qualifying for the M.A. The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is normally an incidental degree on the way to full Ph.D. candidacy once a student has successfully completed the general examination. The M.A. may also be awarded to students who, for various reasons, leave the Ph.D. program, provided the student has successfully completed the six required courses from the Breadth Requirement. Please note, students admitted to the Ph.D. program who do not wish to complete the program may be considered for an M.S.E. degree with approval from the department and the Graduate School. Ph.D. students who have already been awarded the incidental M.A. are not eligible to earn an M.S.E. For students who entered the Ph.D. Program before Fall 2018: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing all the year 2 requirements -- 3 core courses, one additional course, and passing the general exam. For students who entered the Ph.D. Program Fall 2018 and after: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing the 6 required courses from the Breadth Requirements. Teaching Teaching experience is considered to be a significant part of graduate education. All Ph.D. candidates are therefore required to assist with course instruction for the equivalent of two terms. Post-Generals requirements Pre-FPO The preliminary FPO is a research talk given to the anticipated FPO committee approximately six months before the FPO date. The pre-FPO covers results to date and planned research, and serves as a preliminary critique of the proposed dissertation. Graduate students will present a public talk followed by a private meeting with the committee.  The outcome of the pre-FPO is not graded. Graduate students are provided with valuable feedback to the committee expects will guide any final work and will be incorporated into the dissertation. FPO Committee must be identical to the Pre-FPO committee; any subsequent changes to the committee require approval from the DGS. Dissertation and FPO The Ph.D. is awarded after the acceptance of the dissertation and completion of the final public oral. Program Offering: M.S.E. Program description The Master's degree at Princeton is a two year, full-time program. All admitted students will initially be enrolled in the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.), thesis-required track. In the spring of year 1, as part of readmission, all students will be given the option to switch to the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), non-thesis track. Students opting to remain on the M.S.E. track must have a confirmed research adviser and should also have a preliminary thesis proposal. Switching from the M.S.E. track to the M.Eng track will be permitted through January of Year 2. All coursework must be taken for a grade. A minimum of 4 courses must be taken in year 1. If, due to scheduling conflicts,this is not possible, approval by the Director of Graduate Studies is required. In no event will time to degree be extended beyond two years. Funding is normally in the form of teaching assistantships covering the four semesters of the program. Summer funding for M.S.E. candidates in the form of a research assistantship may be offered at the adviser's discretion. Students wishing to continue on for a Ph.D. should apply through the normal application process during the fall of their second year of study. Undergraduate senior thesis and undergraduate independent work courses are not included in this policy. The M.S.E. program is a two year, full-time program of coursework plus submission of an original thesis. Candidates choose a subarea of computer science on which to focus by taking appropriate courses, and writing a thesis under the direction of an adviser. Course requirements are fulfilled by taking six courses for a grade, at least three of which must be 500-level courses. The other eligible courses are 318, 320, 324, 326, 343, 352, 375, or any 400-level course, or 500-level COS course, including COS 597 and 598. You may view a list of approved courses outside of the department here. Relevant courses from outside the department may be taken with Director of Graduate Studies consent. Candidates must maintain a B average, with no more than one C allowed. In order to be readmitted for a second year, candidates must have a confirmed thesis adviser and preliminary thesis proposal by the end of the first year. In addition to satisfactory completion of coursework, candidates must prepare and submit an original thesis as well as present a public seminar on the research. The thesis will be reviewed and graded by your adviser plus one additional reader from the Princeton faculty. If the reader is from outside the Computer Science Department, approval by the Director of Graduate Studies is required. The public seminar is an ungraded 20-minute talk, followed by a 10-minute question session, given in the spring of year 2. This will allow your adviser and reader to give preliminary feedback prior to submission of the final thesis. The written thesis should be a research paper of \"scholarly quality\" -- making a novel contribution to scholarship in the field. The thesis should motivate the chosen research problem, evaluate the proposed solution (e.g., via analysis, measurement, simulation, or prototype implementation), and compare the approach to the related work in the field. While there is no specific length requirement, a reasonable target is a typical conference paper (e.g., 10-15 pages in two-column format or 20-40 pages in single-column, double spaced format). Thesis Requirement Candidates choose a subarea of computer science on which to focus by taking appropriate courses, and writing a thesis under the direction of an advisor.

Students in excellent academic standing who intend to transition to the M.Eng. track may request the department accelerate their two-year program by either one semester or one year, provided all the applicable following conditions are met: 1. Satisfactory performance in all past, current, and future Teaching Assistantship assignments at the University, as evaluated by the Instructor of Record of the course the student is assigned to; 2. The request must be made in writing to the department before the Faculty Deadline for Submission of Graduate Course Grades at the end of the first semester of study; 3. For one-semester acceleration requests : Three courses completed in the first semester, with all A grades (one A- permitted). 4. For one-year acceleration requests: Four courses completed in the first semester, with all A grades (one A- permitted). The department will cancel the request if the student later chooses to remain on the M.S.E. track during their Year 1 reenrollment. Students who accelerate may choose to revert their program of study to its original length by communicating this request in writing to the department. For Princeton undergraduates interested in continuing at Princeton for a Master's Degree : There is now a special policy that allows current Princeton students to count up to two courses taken as an undergraduate towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at Princeton. Those two courses must be upper-level COS courses that fulfill requirements of the Master's degree and have been taken in excess of the COS requirements for the undergraduate degree. For example, if you take ten COS departmentals as an undergraduate at Princeton, and two of them are advanced classes that satisfy requirements of the Master's program, then you can count both towards a Master's degree if you are accepted into the program.  This is a way to reduce your expected time to completion by approximately one semester. Teaching The master’s program is fully funded by teaching assistantships. Master's students are required to hold a full teaching assistantship each semester that they are enrolled. Thesis Candidates for the M.S.E. must prepare and submit an original thesis as well as present a public seminar on the research. The thesis will be reviewed and graded by the student’s adviser plus one additional reader from the Princeton faculty. If the reader is from outside the Department of Computer Science, approval by the director of graduate studies is required. The public seminar is an ungraded 20-minute talk, followed by a 10-minute question session, given in the spring of year 2. This will allow the student’s adviser and reader to give preliminary feedback prior to submission of the final thesis. The written thesis should be a research paper of scholarly quality, making a novel contribution to scholarship in the field. The thesis should motivate the chosen research problem, evaluate the proposed solution (e.g., via analysis, measurement, simulation, or prototype implementation), and compare the approach to the related work in the field. While there is no specific length requirement, a reasonable target is a typical conference paper (e.g., 10-15 pages in two-column format or 20-40 pages in single-column, double-spaced format).  Thesis is due to the adviser, reader, and department prior to Deans Date. Students may resubmit their thesis with revisions for final archiving by Dean's Date.  After being graded, a .pdf file is due to the Graduate Coordinator and should be uploaded to ProQuest.  Click here to review Mudd Library Thesis formatting guidelines .

The Princeton University Archives partners with ProQuest to publish and distribute Princeton University dissertations beyond the campus community. Below you will find instructions on the submission process and the formatting requirements for your Ph.D. dissertation or Master's thesis. If you have questions about this process, please use our Ask Us form or visit the Mudd Manuscript Library during our open hours. Ph.D Dissertation Process Overview of the Ph.D. Dissertation Submission Process Publishing Options Embargoes Embargo Renewals Formatting your Dissertation Fees Deadlines A ccess to Dissertations and Theses The Master’s Thesis Submission Process Ph.D Dissertation Submission Process Overview of the Ph.D. Dissertation Submission Process Step 1) Near the time of the final public oral examination (FPO) (shortly before or immediately after) the student must complete the online submission of their dissertation via the ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator website ( www.etdadmin.com/princeton ). Students are required to upload a PDF of their dissertation, choose publishing options, enter subject categories and keywords, and make payment to ProQuest (if fees apply). This step will take roughly 20-25 minutes. Step 2) After the FPO the student should log on to TigerHub and complete the checkout process. When this step is complete, Mudd Library will be notified for processing. This step will occur M-F during business hours. The Mudd Library staff member will review, apply the embargo (when applicable), and approve the dissertation submission in ProQuest. You will receive an email notification of the approval from ProQuest when it has been approved or needs revisions. Step 3) The vast majority of students will not be required to submit a bound copy of their dissertation to the library. Only students who have removed content from the PDF to avoid copyright infringement are required to submit a bound copy to the library. This unredacted, bound version of the dissertation must be formatted according to the Dissertation Formatting Guidelines , and delivered by hand, mail, or delivery service to the Mudd Manuscript Library by the degree date deadline in order to be placed on the degree list. Address the bound copy to: Attn: Dissertations, Mudd Manuscript Library, 65 Olden Street, Princeton, NJ 08540. Publishing Options ProQuest Publishing Options When you submit your dissertation to the ProQuest ETD Administrator site, you will be given two options: Traditional Publishing or Open Access Publishing Plus. ProQuest compares the two options in their Open Access Overview document . Full details will be presented in the ProQuest ETD Administrator site. Traditional Publishing No fee is paid to ProQuest; your dissertation will be available in full text to subscribing institutions only through the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: Full Text database ; If you have an embargo, your dissertation will be unavailable for viewing or purchase through the subscription database during the embargo period. Open Access Publishing Plus $95 fee to ProQuest; your dissertation will be available in full text through the Internet to anyone via the ProQuest Database ; if you have an embargo, your dissertation will be unavailable for viewing through the open access database during the embargo period. Optional Service: Copyright Registration $75 fee to ProQuest; ProQuest offers the optional service of registering your copyright on your behalf. The dissertation author owns the copyright to their dissertation regardless of copyright registration. Registering your copyright makes a public record of your copyright claim and may entitle you to additional compensation should your copyright be infringed upon. For a full discussion of your dissertation and copyright, see ProQuest’s Copyright and Your Dissertation . If you have questions regarding the ProQuest publishing options, contact their Author and School Relations team at 1-800-521-0600 ext. 77020 or via email at disspub@proquest.com . Princeton’s Institutional Repository, DataSpace Each Princeton University dissertation is deposited in Princeton’s Institutional Repository, DataSpace . Dissertations will be freely available on the Internet except during an embargo period. If your dissertation is embargoed, the PDF will be completely restricted during the embargo period. The bound copy, however, will be available for viewing in the Mudd Manuscript Library reading room during the embargo. Embargoes According to the Graduate School’s embargo policy , students can request up to a two-year embargo on their dissertation, with the potential for renewal by petition. If approved, the embargo would apply to the dissertation in ProQuest, as well as in Princeton’s digital repository, DataSpace . Students in the sciences and engineering seeking patents or pursuing journal articles may be approved for a shorter embargo period. Students must apply for the embargo during the Advanced Degree Application process . More information can be found on the Graduate School's Ph.D. Publication, Access and Embargoing webpage . Those who have been approved for the embargo can choose \"Traditional Publishing\" or \"Open Access Plus\" publishing when they complete their online submission to ProQuest. Mudd Manuscript Library staff will apply the embargo in the ProQuest ETD system at the time of submission of materials to the Library. In the case of Open Access Plus, the dissertation would become freely available on the ProQuest open access site when the embargo expires. The embargo in ProQuest will also apply to the embargo in Princeton’s digital repository, DataSpace Embargo Renewals Those who wish to request a renewal of an existing embargo must email Assistant Dean Geoffrey Hill and provide the reason for the extension. An embargo renewal must be requested in writing at least one month before the original embargo has expired, but may not be requested more than three months prior to the embargo expiration date. Embargoes cannot be reinstituted after having expired. Embargoes are set to expire two years from the date on which the Ph.D. was awarded (degrees are awarded five times per year at Board of Trustee meetings); this date will coincide with the degree date (month and year) on the title page of your dissertation. Please note: You, the student, are responsible for keeping track of the embargo period--notifications will not be sent. To find the exact date of an embargo expiration, individuals can find their dissertation in DataSpace , and view the box at the bottom of the record, which will indicate the embargo expiration date. The Graduate School will inform the Mudd Library of all renewals and Mudd Library staff will institute the extensions in ProQuest and DataSpace . Formatting your Dissertation Princeton University Archives' Dissertation Formatting Requirements (PDF download) document provides detailed information on how to prepare the dissertation PDF and bound volume (if you are required to submit a bound volume). Please take special note of how to format the title page (a title page example is downloadable from the upper-right-hand side of this webpage). The title page must list your adviser’s name. ProQuest's Preparing Your Manuscript guide offers additional information on formatting the PDF. Where there are discrepancies with the Princeton University Archives Dissertation Formatting Requirements document, the Princeton University Archives requirements should be followed.
