Types of Aid Overview No American College is More Affordable Concerned about the cost of college? Let's cut to the chase: you can afford Harvard . Our application process is entirely need-blind, which means that applying for financial aid will have no impact on your admissions decision. Dedicated to Affordability Our goal is to bring the most promising students to Harvard—period. We've created a financial aid program to help ensure that admitted students can afford their Harvard education. Our financial aid officers will work closely with your family to understand your financial situation, then create a comprehensive financial aid package that accounts for the full cost of attendance. Affordability Video This preview video does not contain audio. Video description: Two students share their personal stories about applying for and receiving financial aid from Harvard. Watch \"Affordability for All\" ℹ︎ Video End of embedded content Assessing Your Need Once you're admitted, the Financial Aid Committee will assess your family’s financial need and offer you an award to meet it. We determine need based on your family’s income, assets, and overall financial circumstances. You'll never be required to take on loans, and we don't factor in home equity or retirement savings when crafting your aid package. Most importantly, your financial situation will not affect your chances of admission to Harvard College. We know that each student's financial circumstances are unique. Your financial aid officer will work with you all four years to understand your needs and take the stress out of affording Harvard. Learn about how aid works Calculate Your Cost In just five minutes, you can estimate how much your family will be expected to contribute to your Harvard education. Get Your Estimate What Does Harvard Cost? Harvard costs what your family can afford. We make sure of that. If your family's income is less than $85,000, you'll pay nothing. For families who earn between $85,000 and $150,000, the expected contribution is between zero and ten percent of your annual income. Families who earn more than $150,000 may still qualify for financial aid. Families at all income levels who have significant assets are asked to pay more than those without assets. For more than ninety percent of American families, Harvard costs less than a public university. All students receive the same aid regardless of nationality or citizenship.

When they come to Harvard, they bring their talent, curiosity, and intelligence. They also bring their perspective on the world—an understanding that is deeply tied to their culture, background, and experiences. The result is a diverse, open-minded community where dialogue and debate are not only encouraged—they're inevitable. In Support of Civil Rights & Our Students University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities Read the University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities , adopted in its first interpretation in 1977 and again in its second interpretation in 2002, which relates to issues of free expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, and respect for the dignity of others in the Harvard community. Dean Khurana’s Messages Hate has no place at Harvard. The Admissions & Financial Aid Office firmly supports Dean Khurana’s messages denouncing violence against Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders and denouncing antisemitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, and discrimination on our campus. Our Statement on Anti-Black Racism The Admissions & Financial Aid Office stands with Black people around the nation, and we unequivocally state that Black Lives Matter . College Access We seek to enroll students of all backgrounds and beliefs who will learn from and with one another. Integrity, maturity, strength of character, and concern for others play a significant role in our evaluations. More important, they are integral to a successful Harvard education. “To realize the community’s full promise, and to foster the personal and intellectual transformation at the heart of our mission, we must also work affirmatively and collectively to advance a culture of belonging.” - Drew Faust We want to bring the best people to Harvard, regardless of their ability to pay.

When reading an application, we get to know the person behind the numbers. We take into consideration your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and life experiences. Just as there is no typical Harvard student, there is no ideal Harvard applicant. We look forward to learning more about you. Frequently asked questions about applying Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials) Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the Applicant Portal . This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application. The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty. How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application? We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the Applicant Portal . When do I need to submit test scores if I want them considered in my application? If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed. For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible. Do I need to complete an alumni interview for my first-year application? Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview. Starting an Application For all first-year and transfer applicants, your first step will be to fill out and submit an application. You can do so through the Common Application or the Coalition Application - Powered by Scoir. For first-year applicants, the Common Application opens on August 1 and the Coalition Application opens on August 15. For transfer applicants, both applications open on September 1. We have no preference and each application is treated equally by the Admissions Committee.

We seek promising students who will contribute to the Harvard community during their college years, and to society throughout their lives.

October 31 Restrictive Early Action applicants: We request that you submit your required test scores by the end of October. However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration. November 1 Restrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. Also submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released. Early November If you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT). Mid-December Restrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released. January 1 Your portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. February 1 Notify the Admissions Office ( fileroom@fas.harvard.edu ) if you have not received your application confirmation email. Submit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released.

Early May Reply deadline for admitted students. No deposit required. How and when to submit ACT or SAT scores (for students submitting standardized test scores) You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment. If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed. For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible. You can afford Harvard In just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.* *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

Last Updated: April 25, 2:24pm Close Alert Open Alert: Harvard Yard Closed to the Public Considering a Gap Year Breadcrumb Home - Admissions - Apply - First-Year Applicants - Considering a Gap Year Should You Take Time Off? Each year, between 90 and 130 students defer their matriculation to Harvard College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. We encourage admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way - provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college. Deferrals for two years are also considered for such purposes as military or religious service or under other unique circumstances, and subject to the approval of the admissions committee. Frequently Asked Questions May I defer my admission once admitted? Yes. Students admitted in the Early Action and Regular Decision rounds can choose to defer their admission by selecting the \"I defer\" option in their admitted student reply form. We want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much reported \"burnout\" phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the nation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college. The admissions committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way - provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college.

Each year, between 90 and 130 students defer their matriculation to the College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. After graduation, large numbers of Harvard students take time off before beginning work or graduate school. Read more about taking time off . If a student has already replied as enrolling, but has since changed their mind and would like to defer, they may contact the Admissions Office or submit the Request to Defer form on the Admitted Students Website explaining the request for a deferral as soon as possible and in any event by the end of June.

Author: Rhea Class of Alumni The Unexpected Gap Year Author: Eric Class of Alumni Bridging the Gap: My Year of Deliberate Decision Making Author: Read more student stories Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation The article Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation was originally published in the New York Times on December 6, 2000. William Fitzsimmons Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, Harvard College Marlyn E. McGrath Director of Admissions, Harvard College Charles Ducey Adjunct Lecturer in Psychology, Harvard Graduate School of Education College admissions officers, especially those who admitted the parents of today’s applicants, have an unusual vantage point from which to observe changes from one generation to the next. Many of us are concerned that the pressures on today’s students seem far more intense than those placed on previous generations. College admission—the chance to position oneself for “success” through the acquisition of the “right” college degree—looms large for increasing numbers of students. Particularly because selective colleges are perceived to be part of the problem, we want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much-reported “burnout” phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Of course, the quest for college admission is only one aspect of a much larger syndrome driving many students today. Stories about the latest twenty-something multimillionaires, the astronomical salaries for athletes and pop-music stars, and the often staggering compensation packages for CEOs only stimulate the frenzied search for the brass ring. More than ever, students (and their parents) seek to emulate those who win the “top prizes” and the accompanying disproportionate rewards. From the cradle on… The chase for the prize begins early, and some reports sound hyperbolic. Anecdotes abound of infants serenaded with classical music to enhance their mental powers; toddlers overwhelmed with computers and “educational” toys; “experts” guilt-tripping parents by telling them that their children will be hopelessly behind by age three or four if they don’t follow myriad prescribed strategies. Consultants are paid thousands of dollars to prepare toddlers for the “all- important” interview and observed play-time that will determine admission to the “right” pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, or primary school—thereby presumably ensuring admission to the right high school, college, graduate school, and so on. The consultant will teach the child to maintain eye contact in the interview and to demonstrate both leadership and sharing during the observed play sequence. The competition for admission to some of the pre-k, kindergarten, and grammar schools can be intense—statistically more difficult (with lower admission rates) than Harvard. Once in the “right” school, students are pushed along by teachers, by outside tutors and, if they stumble, by learning specialists who will help them approach their studies in the most efficient manner. The school day continues well into the night with structured study time and drills. The pressure can be relentless, even from well-intentioned parents. For the most part, they simply want the best for their children who, they fear, will be left by the wayside by other high achievers. Sports, music, dance, and other recreational activities used to provide a welcome break, a time to relax and unwind. No more: training for college scholarships—or professional contracts—begins early, even in grammar school. Professional instruction, summer camps, and weekly practice and game schedules consume many hours and nearly all free time. Student and family commuting logistics become byzantine in their complexity. Even “play-time” is often structured and enriched with just the right mix of appropriate playmates and educational activities. Summer vacations have become a thing of the past. The pace of the day and the year allows little time simply “to be a kid”—or, it seems, to develop into a complete human being. The middle school/high school fast track By high school, the pressure intensifies. Students start to specialize in one activity even to the exclusion of other pursuits. Athletes, dancers, musicians and others begin to define themselves by their chosen activity as they try to perfect their new-found talents and identities. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned of possible physical and psychological damage that can result from specializing in a sport prematurely. For every success story, there are countless other less happy results. Some students participate in programs that take up as much time as school. Fast-track athletic teams compete or practice most days—with weekend-consuming road games, and national or international schedules during summers and vacations. A serious athlete or musician or dancer may change schools for a better athletic program, even moving far away from home to do so, and perhaps to an academically weaker school. Academic demands also ratchet up, supported by special tutors and the beginnings of SAT prep in middle school. In high school, SAT prep becomes a way of life for some students, with night and weekend sessions. The “right” SAT tutors may command several hundred dollars per hour, and can be engaged to live during the summer at or near their tutees’ beach houses. Summer “cram schools” for the SATs are increasingly common, as are summer school sessions at the best prep schools and universities, some beginning in middle school. The quest for the right college Professional college counselors (either independent or school-based) appear on the scene early, sometimes in middle school, to begin to structure students’ academic and extracurricular profiles for entrance to the “right” college. At its best, such advice can be helpful in assessing talents, goals, and making “mid-course corrections” that can make a real difference in students’ lives. From a more cynical perspective, such advice steers students toward travel abroad, community service, or other activities solely to enhance college application essays or interviews. Such services may command thousands of dollars, and assistance in preparing applications ranges from appropriate to plagiaristic. Videotaped mock college interviews are features of some packages, as are guided tours of colleges. An array of services start in ninth grade (“or seventh or eighth grade for no extra charge”) for fees of in the thousands of dollars. More specific services include Essay Review, which offers “brainstorming session and as many revisions as necessary.” Such services can add to, rather than alleviate, the stress of the normal expectations of school, community, and family life. Their “products,” such as overly-slick essays, can even hurt a student’s admissions chances as they can sometimes be easy to spot in the admissions process. The pressure of gaining entrance to the most selective colleges is commonly blamed for much of the stress we observe. But those of us who work in college admissions recognize that college is only one of many destinations in the fast lane. The accumulation of “credentials” simply continues to intensify as the stakes increase. The “right” graduate school looms after college, and the “right” sequence of jobs is next. Such attainments make it possible to live in the “right” kinds of communities and to begin the job of bringing up the following generation, one that might need to vault even higher hurdles. The fallout Faced with the fast pace of growing up today, some students are clearly distressed, engaging in binge drinking and other self-destructive behaviors. Counseling services of secondary schools and colleges have expanded in response to greatly increased demand. It is common to encounter even the most successful students, who have won all the “prizes,” stepping back and wondering if it was all worth it. Professionals in their thirties and forties - physicians, lawyers, academics, business people and others - sometimes give the impression that they are dazed survivors of some bewildering life-long boot-camp. Some say they ended up in their profession because of someone else’s expectations, or that they simply drifted into it without pausing to think whether they really loved their work. Often they say they missed their youth entirely, never living in the present, always pursuing some ill-defined future goal. Some early remedies What can be done to help? Fortunately this young fast-track generation itself offers ideas that can reduce stress and prevent burnout. In college application essays and interviews, in conversations and counseling sessions with current college students, and in discussions with alumni/ae, many current students perceive the value of taking time out. Such a “time out” can take many forms. It can be very brief or last for a year or more. It can be structured or unstructured, and directed toward career, academic or purely personal pursuits. Most fundamentally, it is a time to step back and reflect, to gain perspective on personal values and goals, or to gain needed life experience in a setting separate from and independent of one’s accustomed pressures and expectations. For the years during high school, here is some of the advice students have offered: Families should allow for “down-time” during vacations, weekends, and during the week at mealtimes or at any other break in the action. The fabric of family life is already under assault from the demands of parents’ increasingly stressful jobs. Parents, some of whom experienced the first wave of fast-lane childhoods themselves, are often distressed by how little uninterrupted free time they have to devote to their children. Bring summer back. Summer need not be totally consumed by highly structured programs, such as summer schools, travel programs, or athletic camps. While such activities can be wonderful in many ways, they can also add to stress by assembling “super peers” who set nearly impossible standards. Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e. to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead. Choose a high school (or a college) not simply by “brand name” or reputation but because it is the best fit. A school with a slower pace or a different academic or extracurricular focus can be a better match for certain students in the long run. Using the senior year The senior year of high school presents some special challenges and opportunities. The U.S. Department of Education’s Commission on the High School Senior Year calls the senior year a “lost opportunity that we need to reclaim.” While some students try to get by with as little work as possible, others find it the most stressful year of their lives, with more demanding courses, more leadership responsibilities in their extracurricular activities, and the added burden of applying to college and taking the requisite college entrance tests. There is often great tension about choosing and being admitted to the “right” college. Students and their families react to this particular stress in a number of ways, and many want the college admissions process over with as soon as possible. While early admission programs may be right for some students, many observers have begun to ask whether too many students are applying early. They wonder if students are taking enough time and care to select colleges that best match their academic interests, career goals, and personal aspirations. Some have even used the word “hysteria” to describe some students who, perhaps influenced by peer pressure, want to apply early “somewhere”—without considering which colleges might be best for them. Some students have concluded that it is a virtual necessity to apply early, whatever the circumstances, for fear of being left behind. We concur with these observers that early admissions programs have not always served students well. In addition, they are not equally available to all students given the great disparities in guidance counseling and other resources in the United States and elsewhere. We eliminated our early admission program in recent years in part to encourage our students to use their secondary school years in the most effective manner possible. By focusing on the opportunities available in secondary school rather than on applying “early” to college, students will also benefit by avoiding the worst aspects of the college application frenzy that students often find so stressful. While we have restored early admission to meet the rising demand for this option—and have instituted changes to encourage students from modest economic backgrounds to apply early—we hope all students will use early admission in a thoughtful manner and only when it is appropriate for their individual needs. Some high schools help their seniors in the transition from high school to college by allowing a slightly reduced course load, along with alternatives such as community service, research projects, and internships that might help with career exploration. Colleges can help themselves as well as their prospective students by declaring (and demonstrating) that they are not judged simply by the number of AP or other advanced credits amassed at the end of senior year. For example, those students with particular strengths in the humanities and social sciences often believe colleges expect them to take calculus when they might be much better served by another algebra course or statistics—or another language—instead. No matter which path they take, students who can find ways to reduce stress and use the senior year well arrive at college much better prepared to take full advantage of their first year of college. Taking time off before or during college Perhaps the best way of all to get the full benefit of a “time-off” is to postpone entrance to college for a year. For more than four decades, Harvard has recommended this option, indeed proposing it in the letter of admission. Now more than one hundred students defer college until the next year. The results have been uniformly positive. Harvard’s daily student newspaper, The Crimson, reported (5/19/2000) that students who had taken a year off found the experience “so valuable that they would advise all Harvard students to consider it.” Harvard’s overall graduation rate of 97 percent is among the highest in the nation, perhaps in part because so many students take time off. One student, noting that the majority of her friends will simply spend eight consecutive terms at Harvard, “wondered if they ever get the chance to catch their breath.” During her year off, the student quoted above toured South America with an ice-skating company and later took a trip to Russia. Another interviewed in the article worked with a growing e-commerce company (in which the staff grew from 10 to 100 during the year) and backpacked around Europe for six months. Some options for the interim year Members of one recent class participated in the following activities, and more, in the interim year: drama, figure skating, health-care, archeological exploration, kibbutz life, language study, mineralogical research, missionary work, music, non-profit groups, child welfare programs, political campaigns, rebuilding schools, special needs volunteering, sports, steel drumming, storytelling, swing dance, university courses, and writing—to name some chosen at random. They took their interim year in the following locales: Belize, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Scandinavia, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Uruguay, United States and Zimbabwe. Many students divide their year into several segments of work, travel, or study. Not all can afford to travel or to take part in exotic activities. A number have served in the military or other national or international service programs. Some remain at home, working, taking part-time courses, interning, and still finding the time to read books they have never had time to fit into their schedules or begin to write the “great American novel.” Others have been able to forge closer ties with parents or grandparents from whom they may have drifted away during the hectic pace of the high-school years. Reactions to the year off Students taking a year off prior to Harvard are doing what students from the U.K. do with their so-called “gap year.” Other countries have mandatory military service for varying periods of time. Regardless of why they took the year off or what they did, students are effusive in their praise. Many speak of their year away as a “life-altering” experience or a “turning point,” and most feel that its full value can never be measured and will pay dividends the rest of their lives. Many come to college with new visions of their academic plans, their extracurricular pursuits, the intangibles they hoped to gain in college, and the career possibilities they observed in their year away. Virtually all would do it again. Nevertheless, taking time off can be a daunting prospect for students and their parents. Students often want to follow friends on safer and more familiar paths. Parents worry that their sons and daughters will be sidetracked from college, and may never enroll. Both fear that taking time off can cause students to “fall behind” or lose their study skills irrevocably. That fear is rarely justified. High school counselors, college administrators, and others who work with students taking time off can help with reassurance that the benefits far outweigh the risks. Occasionally students are admitted to Harvard or other colleges in part because they accomplished something unusual during a year off. While no one should take a year off simply to gain admission to a particular college, time away almost never makes one a less desirable candidate or less well prepared for college. Achieving balance While the focus here has been on ways to relieve stress for today’s high-achieving generation, we should note that in fact most students are coping well with pressure, even thriving. This remarkable time offers opportunities that previous generations (and students in many other countries today) could not imagine. Colleges, for example, now reach out through their recruiting programs to talented students from every economic background. Financial aid makes college a reality for outstanding students on a scale that was not possible before. Graduation rates at leading American colleges and universities remain extremely high and students express satisfaction with their college experiences. It is important to remember that access to higher education around the world is at present limited to a lucky few. Those fortunate enough to enjoy such a privilege have a responsibility to use their talents to provide expanded opportunities for future generations. Our young alumni and alumnae have been successful in meeting the formidable challenges they have faced since college. But they continue to remind us that the rigors of competing in the new world economy impose high standards on everyone. They do not (nor do we) tell today’s students to “slack off” and achieve less. Recent graduates advise today’s high school and college students to prepare themselves emotionally as well as academically. It is worth noting that extraordinary achievements are never based on emulating someone else’s achievements, but on some unmeasurable combination of (a) marching to one’s own specific and unique drummer and (b) accidentally—perhaps unconsciously—doing something that captures the Zeitgeist in new and unexpected ways. Those whom parents often want their children to emulate either used their own ingenuity to give the public a product or image it desperately wanted, or happened to catch a hot wave of the time, or (ideally) both. While their achievement stands as an ideal for which others strive, others cannot by definition duplicate that achievement because it is induplicable. So the problem can often be well-meaning but misguided parents who try to mold their children into an image of success they value; and their children, being moldable as they are, often get on board and go along with the program before they have any capacity to make such a choice for themselves. Yet the paradox is that the only road to real success is to become more fully oneself, to succeed in the field and on the terms that one defines for oneself. So the pressures placed on many children probably have the unintended effect of delaying a child’s finding herself and succeeding on her own terms. We should all have the right to gape with awe at Yo-Yo Ma’s musical triumphs, while at the same time achieving our own more modest ones in our own fields and ways: finding hominid bones that shift our conception of paleontology, or composing smooth jazz melody, or tracing the rise and decline of Roman gentes. Parents and students alike profit from redefining success as fulfillment of the student’s own aims, even those yet to be discovered. Burnout is an inevitable result of trying to live up to alien goals. Time out can promote discovery of one’s own passions. The fact remains that there is something very different about growing up today. Some students and families are suffering from the frenetic pace, while others are coping but enjoying their lives less than they would like. Even those who are doing extraordinarily well, the “happy warriors” of today’s ultra-competitive landscape, are in danger of emerging a bit less human as they try to keep up with what may be increasingly unrealistic expectations. The good news is that students themselves offer helpful suggestions about how best to handle the challenges they face. In part because of all the obstacles that confront them from the earliest stages of their lives, this generation has emerged generally more mature, sophisticated, and, at their best, better prepared to cope with the demands of the twenty-first century. They learn at an early age how to cope with both victory and defeat and with the formidable demands placed on them by adults and peers. Yet many would benefit from a pause in their demanding lives. Let us hope that more of them will take some sort of time out before burnout becomes the hallmark of their generation. 2000 - Revised 2017 Related Topics Residential Life Residential Life at Harvard provides the opportunity to develop your own community through shared experiences.

You may also send a check or money order to Harvard College Admissions, 86 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA 02138. Please include the applicant’s name with the payment. Fee waivers: We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow these instructions to request your fee waiver . Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way. Completing the Harvard supplement questions Complete the Harvard Questions with the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir*. This includes the following five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard? Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you. *Please note that the Harvard supplement is separate for the Coalition Application, so you must submit both the application AND supplement for your application to be considered complete. Additional application questions What if I am homeschooled? Each applicant to Harvard College is considered with great care and homeschooled applicants are treated the same as all other applicants. There is no special process, but all relevant information about your educational and personal background is welcome. In addition to the application, all applicants are required to submit a transcript (which can be created by the family member or agency overseeing your schooling), and recommendations. If the application fee presents a hardship for your family, simply request a fee waiver . Hear from Harvard students who were homeschooled, in the Harvard Gazette article ‘ Homeschooled en route to Harvard .’ What if I need to make updates to my application after I submit it? Do not resend your application in order to make updates. If you need to update your identification or contact information, or send updates, additional information, or corrections, please do so via the Applicant Portal . Misrepresentation of Credentials Be completely accurate in your application materials. If we discover a misrepresentation during the admissions process, you will be denied admission. If you have already been admitted, your offer will typically be withdrawn. If you have already registered, your admission will normally be revoked, and we will require you to leave the College. Harvard rescinds degrees if misrepresentations in application materials are discovered. The determination that an application is inaccurate or contains misrepresentations rests solely with the Admissions Office and will be resolved outside the student disciplinary process. School Reports and Teacher Recommendations Secondary School Report The secondary school report is a required form that is submitted by your school counselor or another school leader. This form gives an overview of the student's academic record. It includes the applicant's academic transcript(s), a letter of recommendation, and a school profile (if available). If a counselor is unable to submit a letter of recommendation for the applicant, another teacher or school leader may submit an additional recommendation letter. Midyear School Report When you apply, your school counselor will often send your transcript with few or no senior year course grades included. That is why the midyear school report is required - to allow us to review your performance in the first half of your senior year coursework . The midyear school report must be completed by your school counselor or other school official. Please request that the midyear school report is completed and returned to our office as soon as possible. Midyear School Report FAQs What if I'm applying Restrictive Early Action and I don't have my midyear grades yet? Restrictive Early Action applicants are not required to submit the midyear report by the November 1 deadline. If you applied Restrictive Early Action and are deferred to Regular Decision, please submit the midyear report and transcript in February, or as soon as your midyear grades are available. I'm an international student and my academic year is different. Do I still need to submit the midyear report? If you study the IB curriculum or the A-level curriculum, then we expect that your school will send predicted grades, based on your current classroom work and the results of any internal or mock exams you have taken up to that point. If your school does not issue official or predicted midyear grades for your final year of school, then you do not need to submit the midyear report form, although the item may remain on your checklist. What if I have already graduated from high school? If you have already graduated from high school, you should ignore the midyear report requirement (though the item may remain on your Checklist in the Applicant Portal) and simply ask your school to send a final school report if you have not already done so. Teacher Evaluations Ask two teachers in different academic subjects who know you well to complete the Teacher Recommendation forms (which includes an evaluation form and a letter of recommendation). If you wish to submit additional letters of recommendation, you can do so after you submit your application. In your application confirmation email, there will be a personalized link to send to your recommenders. What courses should I take to prepare for applying to Harvard? There is no “one size fits all” rule about which curriculum to study during secondary school years. Students should challenge themselves by taking courses deemed appropriate by their teachers and counselors. But some students believe that “more is always better” when it comes to AP, IB or other advanced courses. While some students prosper academically and personally by taking large numbers of such courses, others benefit from a more balanced approach that allows them additional time for extracurricular and personal development. Even the best students can be negatively affected by taking too many courses at once, and might benefit instead from writing, reading or research projects on subjects of great interest to them. To learn more, read our Guide to Preparing for College. To avoid the “burnout” often seen among secondary school students, please refer to our article, Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation . Is there a specific math requirement? Applicants to Harvard should excel in a challenging high school math sequence corresponding to their educational interests and aspirations. We recommend that applicants take four years of math courses in high school. Ideally, these math courses will focus on conceptual understanding, promote higher-order thinking, and encourage students to use mathematical reasoning to critically examine the world. Examples include rigorous and relevant courses in computer science, statistics and its subfields, mathematical modeling, calculus, and other advanced math subjects. Students’ math records are viewed holistically, and no specific course is required. Specifically, calculus is not a requirement for admission to Harvard. We understand that applicants do not have the same opportunities and course offerings in their high schools. Moreover, many programs of study at Harvard do not require knowledge of calculus. We encourage applicants to take the courses that are available to them and aligned with their interests and goals. Students intending to study engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other fields where calculus is needed may benefit from taking calculus in high school. However, students at Harvard can still pursue such fields by starting with one of our introductory calculus classes that has no high school calculus prerequisite. On balance, we encourage all students to master foundational mathematical material instead of rushing through any of the more advanced courses. Final School Report and Transcripts All admitted students who choose to enroll are required to send a Final School Report and transcript as soon as their final grades become available – no later than July 1. The Final School Report and transcript should be completed and sent by a school counselor or other school official through Parchment/Docufide or Scrip-Safe International, if your school has access to these submission options. IB students should send their final results as soon as they are released in mid-July. We will expect to see final A levels results by mid-August. Standardized Test Scores Harvard College will require the submission of standardized test scores from applicants for admission as part of the comprehensive application process that takes a whole-student approach. The College will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases when those tests are not accessible, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions Standardized Testing FAQs Can I self-report my test scores? Yes. Applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, IB, etc.). Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores. How do I send my test scores? You are free to use the College Board Score Choice option or the similar option offered by the ACT. Our official codes are 3434 for the College Board SAT Reasoning Tests and 1840 for the ACT if you are submitting official test scores as part of your application. How to send your SAT scores How to send your ACT scores Are there test score \"cutoffs\"? There are no score cutoffs, and we do not admit “by the numbers.” For the ACT, we will evaluate your highest composite score and any other scores you choose to share with us. We take into account your educational background when reviewing your scores. How should I prepare for standardized tests? Our admissions committee understands that opportunities to prepare for standardized tests vary greatly for students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. You may find it helpful to utilize free-test prep from Khan Academy or join a free SAT bootcamp on Schoolhouse.world . The ACT provides sample tests to practice.  Such free programs could help students from under-resourced schools by providing the academic tools that will serve them well on standardized tests and also in college. Students can also do well by studying widely and deeply  on their own with the help of family, school, or community organizations. What do standardized tests and grades indicate about academic preparation for college? SAT and ACT tests are better predictors of Harvard grades than high school grades. However, admission officers understand that not all students attend well-resourced schools throughout their lives, and that those who come from modest economic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for standardized tests. High school grades in a rigorous academic program can also be helpful in assessing readiness for college courses, but the thousands of secondary schools around the country and the world employ various high school curricula and a wide range of grading systems - and some have no grades at all. Other students have been homeschooled or prepared for college by taking part in multiple schooling opportunities both in person and electronic. Given the wide variation in how students prepare for Harvard – as well as the fact that most applicants and admitted students have outstanding academic records – it is difficult for high school grades to differentiate individual applications. That does not mean that high school grades are unimportant. Students who come to Harvard have done well day to day in their high school studies, providing a crucial foundation for academic success in college, including a 97% - 98% graduation rate. Each application to Harvard is read with great care, keeping in mind that talent is everywhere, but opportunity and access are not. How will Harvard evaluate the new digital SAT? The College Board's shift to a digital delivery of the SAT will not impact the way in which Harvard reviews test scores within applications. Please visit the College Board FAQs for more information. Supplemental Materials Our standard application materials typically give us ample information for making admission decisions. However, we recognize you may have truly exceptional talents or achievements you wish to share, and we want you to have every opportunity to best represent yourself. At the discretion of the Admissions Committee, supplementary materials—such as music recordings, artwork, or selected samples of academic work—may be evaluated by faculty. These materials are entirely optional. Material Types How to submit documents and articles Scholarly articles, research, creative writing or other documents of which you are the primary author should be submitted in the Upload Materials section of the Applicant Portal . This is the most efficient and direct method of submitting these materials, because they will be added directly to your official application. All submissions should include a list of any individuals with whom you collaborated in the production of the work. If appropriate, please identify your research sponsor, mentor, and/or laboratory or research group leader and provide a short description of your particular contribution to the work. How to submit media (video, audio, or images) You may submit optional supplementary media materials (e.g. videos, audio recordings, or images) electronically via Slideroom . Details for submissions in art, dance or choreography, musical performance or composition, will be found on the Slideroom website. There is a small submission fee, but if this fee causes you economic hardship, you may request a fee waiver at the point of submission. You may also contact us to request a fee waiver. If you encounter technical difficulties on Slideroom, you may submit a document via your portal with YouTube video links. Our team may follow up to request a Slideroom submission at a later time. Should I submit other academic materials? Harvard accepts other standardized tests or other academic credentials if you choose to submit them. In any admissions process, additional information can be helpful. For example, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-levels, national leaving examinations, national or international contests, early high school assessment scores such as the PSAT or pre-ACT, or courses taken outside your school during the school year or summer are just some examples of information that could be submitted. Subject Tests and the essay portion of the SAT have been terminated, except in certain special circumstances. Harvard admission officers review all materials that an applicant submits, so if you’ve already taken Subject Tests or the essay portion of the SAT, you may still submit them along with your other application materials.

U.S. Military veterans may be particularly interested in our transfer program if they've completed at least one full academic year, and not more than two, of college coursework. Transfer FAQs Do transfer students qualify for financial aid? Yes. All transfer applicants, including international students, are eligible to apply for need-based financial aid. Transfer applicants should follow the prospective student financial aid application instructions. How are transfer students supported on campus? Enrolling students take part in a fall orientation program and are connected with a dedicated transfer adviser who helps with academic planning and the transition to Harvard life. Transfer students who live on-campus will find strong community in their undergraduate Houses, and students who live off campus will benefit from the Dudley Community. Transfer students are also supported by peer advisers , who were themselves transfer students from prior years. What courses transfer to Harvard College? Is there a list of transferrable courses? The Harvard College Registrar's Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. The admissions office does not keep a list of transferrable courses and cannot advise on this matter during the application process. Harvard College typically accepts courses taken while enrolled as a full-time student in an undergraduate program similar to our liberal arts curriculum. The Committee also looks for strong preparation in the student's expected field of specialization. Can I concentrate in business, journalism, law, or medicine? While you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students. I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me? The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here . About Our Transfer Program Each fall, we welcome a very small number (12 on average) of transfer students to Harvard College. We seek students whose previous academic experience will prepare them to flourish in our rigorous and rewarding liberal arts program. In our candidates for transfer admission, we look for: A clearly defined academic need to transfer A proven record of achievement at your current institution Strong faculty recommendations Recently, we have received more than 1,500 transfer applications per year. In pools of this size, the number of well-qualified applicants far exceeded the number of students admitted and enrolled each year as transfer students. As admission to transfer to Harvard is competitive, we encourage you to explore a variety of colleges in your transfer search. Eligibility To be eligible to transfer, you must have completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, and not more than two academic years, by the time you would be enrolling at Harvard . You must complete at least two full years of study at Harvard. Once a student has completed more than two years total of college at another institution, regardless of courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission. Students are eligible to transfer only from a liberal arts curriculum that is similar to Harvard’s. Candidates whose education has been in a vocational, professional, technical, online, extension, or performance program will not ordinarily qualify for transfer admission. Students who have completed one full-time year of college in a regular degree program in lieu of their senior year of high school (often referred to as dual enrollment) should apply for first-year admission if these courses are taken for credit towards a high school diploma. Students who are enrolled part-time are not eligible unless they have previously completed one full-time, continuous academic year. If you are too advanced in your studies to qualify for transfer, you may be interested in the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. No student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the 12 Harvard University graduate schools . The Harvard College Admissions Office is independent of these schools and their admissions policies. Take a Virtual Tour Use our Virtual Tour to discover spaces that aren't even available on an in-person campus tour, such as classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and more. Explore Harvard What We Look For Through our admissions process, we strive to give you ample opportunities to best demonstrate your interests and accomplishments. We welcome candidates who have gone directly from high school into college as well as those who have followed less traditional paths. The Admissions Committee looks for achievement in a rigorous program of study, especially in your expected field of specialization. Beyond strong grades, test scores, and recommendations, the Committee considers other non-academic factors such as significant extracurricular engagements and talents. We also consider an applicant’s personal qualities such as a capacity for leadership, creativity, resiliency, intellectual curiosity, and independent thinking. In addition to our standard application materials, you may submit supplementary materials showcasing exceptional or unusual talents, including musical performance, artistic work, and research material. Learn more about what we look for Timeline Harvard accepts transfer students for fall semester entrance only; we do not admit students for the spring semester. The transfer application becomes available during the fall of the academic year. March 1 : Deadline for all transfer application and financial aid materials. The Transfer Admissions Committee begins to review applications after the application deadline. We will notify applicants of admissions decisions in June. Submitting your materials early does not increase your chances of admission, but it does provide more opportunities to track down any missing documents and ensure that your application is full and complete by the time we begin our review. Please note that college transcripts should be sent between January and March in order to reflect your most updated academic credentials.

Transferring Course Credit Harvard will honor comparable coursework you have done prior to your transfer admission, while also giving you time to take advantage of Harvard’s course offerings and delve deeply into your concentration. You will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 16 semester-long courses—the equivalent of two full years of academic work—providing you the opportunity to take the remaining half of the courses required for your A.B. or S.B. degree at Harvard. The Harvard College Registrar’s Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. While Harvard does not audit transcripts prior to application to determine eligibility, the descriptions below should be helpful in determining which of your courses may transfer. Our office is unable to make recommendations in regards to coursework at your current institution or advise on anticipated class standing during the application process. Which courses are eligible for credit? You may receive credit for courses taken in a full-time, daytime program of study at an accredited degree-granting institution, provided that you: Took courses comparable to those offered in Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum. Earned grades of “C” (or the equivalent) or better Which courses are not eligible for credit? Unfortunately, we are unable to grant credit for certain accomplishments. Harvard does not typically award credit for: Online or distance education courses Night or extension courses Courses taken on a part-time basis Technical or vocational courses such as accounting, marketing, journalism, law, agriculture, nursing, business, communications or specialized military training coursework Dual-enrollment courses counted for credit toward a high school diploma Work done prior to admission in an isolated term, semester or quarter at another college, unless the college from which you are transferring has granted credit for that work Credit gained by accelerating in an academic year at another college College Level Placement Exam (CLEP), Advanced Placement Exam (AP/IB) results, or any credit earned by examination, even when credited to your degree by the college or university from which you wish to transfer Summer school courses, except for those at your current college/university or courses at Harvard Summer School Contacting Transfer Admissions The Transfer Admissions team will be available to answer questions by email at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu Monday through Friday between the hours of 9am and 5pm ET.

We consider high academic standards, leadership in non-academic areas, and personal qualities in all of our admission decisions. However, the many and unique experiences which constitute military service at all levels usually become an important part of a veteran’s application. How to Apply The first thing you will need to determine is your eligibility to apply either as a first-year or transfer student. If you have not completed a full year of college course work, you can apply as a first-year student . If you have completed more than one year’s worth of college courses, but less than two years in total, you can apply as a transfer student . Please note that if you have more than two years of college course work, you are not eligible for admission to Harvard College. Also, please note that military training courses do not count for entrance either as a first-year or transfer student. We encourage all U.S. military veterans to review our application requirements . If you have specific questions, please contact us ; we are here to help. It's also worth noting that Harvard is a member of Service to School’s VetLink program , which provides advising and support to veterans throughout the college application process. Don't let the application fee prevent you from applying - we automatically waive the application fee for ALL U.S. military veteran applicants.

Veterans typically receive benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, in addition to the Post 9/11 GI Bill® programs. Harvard’s generous need-based financial aid program may supplement or even replace the use of veteran’s benefits toward the total cost of attendance. We will also waive the application fee if it presents a hardship on you or your family. Don’t let the cost stand in the way of pursuing a Harvard education.

Veteran FAQs Is there a separate or different admissions process for military veterans? There is no separate or different admissions process for applicants who are or will be veterans. Applicants with less than one year of college credit may apply as first-year students and those with between one and two years of college credit may apply as transfer students. Please visit the U.S. Military Veterans page to learn more about admissions and financial aid. I am a US military veteran. Should I apply as a first-year or transfer student? To be eligible to transfer to Harvard College, you must have satisfactorily completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college by your anticipated date of matriculation at Harvard, and not have completed more than two years total in college. Please note that once a student has completed more than two years of college coursework at another institution, regardless of the courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission or freshman admission. Our office cannot make exceptions to this policy as it is set by the Harvard faculty. If you do not meet the above requirements and have not yet completed one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, then you may apply for freshman admission to Harvard College. Please note that if you are eligible to apply as a freshman that any college coursework you have completed would not transfer to Harvard College. I have never taken the SAT or ACT, or I have not taken the SAT or ACT in recent years and cannot because I’ve been on active duty, what do I do? Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions Does Harvard have any student groups or alumni groups for veterans? Yes, Harvard College offers both student and alumni groups for veterans. Please visit the Harvard Undergraduate Veterans Organization for information about our student group and Harvard Veterans for information about our alumni group. Do students who are veterans have to live on campus? No, while Harvard College is predominantly residential, some students do not live in College housing. Undergraduates living off campus may elect to be members of Dudley Community. This option has appealed to a number of students, including married students and students who wish to be part of a fully non-residential community. Students who are part of Dudley Community are eligible for meal contracts in Dudley Community and are included in all social and cultural activities sponsored by the Community. They are \"deaned\" by the Allston Burr Resident Dean of Dudley Community and are advised for purposes of fellowship and professional school application by Dudley Community tutors. Does Harvard accept credit earned from classes taken during my time in the military? Military-specific coursework or credits earned via military training and service, including courses appearing on Joint Services Transcripts, are not generally accepted for transfer credit at Harvard. Online courses are also not generally eligible for transfer credit. Only courses that are liberal arts in nature (in fields comparable to those offered at Harvard College), and that were taken in person while enrolled as a full-time college student, can be considered for transfer credit. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Office evaluates transcripts for all admitted transfer students to determine course transferability once a student has been admitted. As a military veteran, my high school grades do not reflect my current work ethic and commitment to my studies. How does this impact my application? We consider an applicant’s full range of experiences and growth from those experiences, especially for veterans. A weak high school transcript does not necessarily mean you will not be a compelling candidate for Harvard. Look at your high school transcript with a critical eye, identify what your weaknesses in the classroom might have been and think about what you have done since that time to address those weaknesses. Be prepared to explain any steps you have taken to improve. I have been away from school for a while during my military service. Do I still need to submit letters of recommendation? We fully understand that high school teachers may not remember you or still be at your school. We normally suggest that you get a similar set of letters from people who know you well in your current phase of life, such as commanding officers or other professors/instructors (if you have pursued any coursework since high school). Helpful letters might address how you dealt with adversity, stress, or other challenges, how you got along with your peers and how you have maximized opportunities available to you – all critical components to success at Harvard and beyond. How can I interview if I am unable to leave my military base or am deployed at sea? Interviews are not required for admission. If you are contacted for an interview and are not able to leave base, please call our office (617-495-1551) so that we may assist. If you are applying as a transfer student, please know that interviews are not routinely offered to transfer applicants. In cases where it is difficult to reach an applicant we may request a phone or Skype interview. Is it possible to enroll at Harvard College and complete my coursework remotely while remaining on active duty? Harvard College does not presently offer an option to work toward a degree remotely. Harvard Extension School offers more flexible options for students seeking opportunities to study remotely. Learn more about the Extension School's undergraduate degrees .

If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver directly through the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, if you meet their respective indicators of economic need. If you do not meet these indicators, please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived . Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way. Will Harvard provide travel expenses for international students who receive financial aid? All students, American and international, who are on financial aid have a travel allowance included in their financial aid award to help cover the cost of travel to and from Cambridge. Overseas students are advised to seek information from the nearest U.S. Cultural Affairs Office about travel grants and other financial assistance available to qualified students from various foundations and from the U.S. government. Common Questions We are often asked by prospective students, “Do you count me as an international applicant?”  Because all applicants follow the same procedures and timetables and are eligible for the same financial aid, we do not need to categorize individual applicants as either international or domestic.  We have foreign citizens applying from American high schools and American citizens applying from high schools around the world.  When we refer to “international admissions,” we are generally referring to applicants who apply from schools outside the United States as the documentation submitted by those schools may differ substantially from that submitted by an American high school and may require specialized knowledge. Please note that we do not have quotas or limits based on either citizenship or location of high school. Furthermore, admissions decisions are made without regard to whether an applicant has applied for financial aid, even if the applicant is a foreign citizen. The Harvard Club of the UK has created a website to answer specific questions for those applying from the United Kingdom. You may find it a useful source of supplemental information. Learn More - International Brochure Financial Aid Our financial aid policies are the same for all applicants, regardless of nationality or citizenship. All aid is based on financial need, and admissions decisions are made without regard to whether an applicant has applied for financial assistance. Harvard meets each student’s demonstrated need.

Try our Net Price Calculator Standardized Tests Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: AP exam results IB Actual or Predicted Scores GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions English language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo cannot be used to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials. Students may self report their standardized test scores. If the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results. More information about standardized testing is included on our application requirements page. English Language Proficiency A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly.  Although you are not required to take an English proficiency exam (such as the TOEFL, IELTS, etc.), you may submit scores if you wish to do so.

Last Updated: April 25, 2:24pm Close Alert Open Alert: Harvard Yard Closed to the Public Prospective Students Breadcrumb Home - Financial Aid - Apply For Financial Aid - Prospective Students On This Page: Overview Requirements Deadlines CSS Profile FAFSA IDOC Frequently Asked Questions Overview You Can Afford Harvard We will work with you and your family one-on-one to help you navigate the options and make sure Harvard is an affordable option for your education. Requirements The process to apply for financial aid is essentially the same for all prospective students. Regardless of your citizenship or when you are applying, you will need to submit a CSS Profile and an IDOC Packet. US Citizens and Permanent Residents will also need to submit the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA is a free form and if you only wish to apply for federal aid it is the only form you need to submit. The instructions below are for the 2024-2025 school year. The application can generally be submitted starting October 1, 2023, but may open a couple days before this date. Applying for Financial Aid at Harvard This preview video does not contain audio. Video description: an illustrated guide to applying for financial aid Watch \"How to Apply for Financial Aid\" ℹ︎ How to Apply for Financial Aid Video End of embedded content Deadlines ​Our goal is to provide you with a decision about financial aid at the time that you are admitted. For Restrictive Early Action applicants that means an estimate of financial aid in mid-December, and for both Restrictive Early Action and Regular Decision applications, a financial aid decision around April 1. Although we’ll accept a late application, we may not be able to get back to you as quickly as we would if your application was submitted along the timeline below. Please note that you cannot access IDOC until you have completed the CSS Profile. Financial Aid Application Deadlines Restrictive Early Action Regular Decision Transfer CSS Profile November 1 February 1 March 1 FAFSA February 1 February 1 March 1 IDOC November 1 February 1 March 1 FAQs about Deadlines How can I make this process easier? Keep a file with prior and current year wage statements, pay stubs, and tax documents. File your taxes as early as you can. US Citizens, be sure to double check your SSN on all submissions. Always use your full, legal name. No nicknames in financial aid! What if I'm an international student? International students are eligible for the same amount of aid as US students. If your parents file an income tax document in their country, you will submit that as part of the financial aid process. Make sure to translate the document to English. You don’t need an official translation - usually students will write the translation on the document themselves. If your parents don’t file an income tax document, submit a wage statement, pay slip, or letter from their employer(s) stating their annual income. Where can I track my aid application status? We don’t track financial aid materials until after admissions decisions have been made. In the meantime, you can log in to your College Board account to see your submissions. Rest assured that if you are admitted and we find something is missing, we’ll notify you. CSS Profile File the online 2024-2025 CSS Profile via the College Board. Make sure to include Harvard as a recipient using the code 3434. If your parents are married or live together, they will file one CSS Profile. If they are separated or divorced, each parent will fill out their own CSS Profile . The CSS Profile asks questions about your family’s financial situation including numbers you will find on your family’s tax returns. If you have not yet filed your tax returns, feel free to estimate. We’ll update the CSS Profile after you’ve submitted your actual tax returns. The CSS Profile has a built in fee waiver for US students , based on their financial circumstances. If you are an international student who cannot afford the CSS Profile fee, or if you live in a country from which the College Board cannot process payments, you may follow this alternate set of instructions . CSS Profile FAQs What if I make a mistake on the CSS Profile? We’ll update the CSS Profile with your tax information when it gets to IDOC. If you need to make other corrections that won’t naturally be updated by your taxes, you can update your Profile application once by clicking “Correct Your CSS Profile” on your CSS Profile Dashboard. FAFSA The FAFSA is a free form that determines your eligibility for federal aid. Only students who are US Citizens, Permanent Residents, or other eligible non-citizens will file the FAFSA. You may have heard about FAFSA Simplification for the 2024-2025 school year, which means the FAFSA has opened later than it usually does. Rest assured that this will have no negative effect on our financial aid process and decision release. File the 2024-2025 FAFSA , which is available online or as a mobile app, starting January 1, 2024. Remember to include Harvard’s code E00468 so that we receive the FAFSA. Read our guide: How to complete the FAFSA FAFSA FAQs What is FAFSA Simplification? The federal government has passed legislation to significantly change the FAFSA with the goal of making the FAFSA easier and faster to complete. You can read more about FAFSA Simplification on the Federal Student Aid website . How does FAFSA Simplification affect Early Action financial aid decisions? The FAFSA determines your eligibility for federal aid, such as the Pell Grant, Federal Work-Study, and subsidized federal loans. At Harvard, we use our own methodology to award our need-based financial aid. Ideally we would collect all of the financial aid application materials at the same time, allowing us to send students a comprehensive financial aid decision, listing their eligibility for both federal and institutional funds, at the time they are admitted. Since the FAFSA will likely not be available before Early Action decisions are released in December, we will simply assess students’ overall eligibility for financial aid during the Early Action financial aid process, and will update their decisions to include federal funding later on, after the FAFSA has been submitted. What if I'm applying to more than 20 schools? The FAFSA will only let you have 20 schools listed at one time. You’re welcome to take Harvard off your list if you need more space, but be sure to add us back on if you are admitted. If it turns out that the FAFSA did not come through, we'll alert you if you are admitted. IDOC We require submission of tax and other documents through the College Board IDOC Service , which is a fast and secure way to upload your information for review. The IDOC Service is open to all applicants who have already completed a CSS Profile. IDOC will show a list of basic documents to be uploaded, but their list is not the definitive list of what you need to submit. Additional required documents are listed below. Gather together all of the following that apply, and submit them to IDOC. Please do not send draft or estimated taxes. We need the actual 2022 tax return as filed with the government. If your documents are not in English, please be sure to translate them. Parents’ 2022 income tax document for both parents : for US students, this is usually the signed 1040 Federal Income Tax Return with all pages and schedules, including W-2 Forms. For many international students, this will be whatever documentation of income and taxes paid your parents submit to their national government (which may be two separate documents in your country). If your parents do not file tax returns, please submit a Tax Non-Filer Statement , and whatever documentation they do have, such as a wage statement, salary certificate, or letter from their employer(s) stating annual income. Student’s 2022 income tax document : if you do not file a tax document, please submit a Tax Non-Filer Statement , and a copy of any W-2 Forms, if you received any. Students who submit tax returns should be sure that they are signed. Business documents : if either of your parents has an interest in a business or farm, submit: A Business/Farm Supplement Form for each business and/or farm. The 2022 business tax return for each business and/or farm. In the US, this refers to the full 1065 Partnership Return, 1120 S Corporate Return, and 1120 Corporate Return, along with K-1 Statements. Trust or estate documents : if you or your parents are the beneficiary of an estate or trust, submit: The full Trust Tax Return. A letter explaining the contents of the trust or estate, value, and accessibility. Additional information : if you have any unusual expenses or special circumstances to share, feel free to submit a letter with the rest of your documents. Frequently Asked Questions Can I email my documents? No. Email is not a secure method for sending financial aid information. Please submit everything as described in our instructions. Do I need to submit every page of the tax return? You should include all pages and schedules of your federal or national income tax return. A common mistake is for US students to send only one or two pages of the tax return, leaving out the schedules (for example Schedule 1, Schedule A, Schedule B, etc). You do not need to send copies of state tax returns. Canadian Student Tips The Canadian tax document you must submit is called the T-1 General Form. The corporate return is called the T-2 Corporate Return. Late Tax Filing If your parents file for an extension or won’t be able to file taxes by the application deadline, sit tight and submit them whenever they become available. Obviously, it’s better to file early, but a late application just pushes back when you get your financial aid decision - it does not affect your eligibility for aid. Is IDOC's list of required documents definitive? No. IDOC will show only the most common, basic, required documents. You should use our list of required documents from this instructions page as your list of required documents. Submit to IDOC anything else as an ‘institution specific required document’ or ‘other document’. Can I use the IDOC's tax non-filer statement instead of Harvard's? Feel free to use either Tax Non-Filer Statement, whether from our website, or the IDOC website. Both are acceptable.

The process of applying for financial aid from Harvard is essentially the same for all students, but please read through these instructions and refer to your my.harvard account to see which specific materials we need from your family. You will need to submit your 2022 tax information for the 2024-2025 academic year. If you applied for financial aid in the previous year, you will automatically be emailed instructions to apply for renewal in February. If you have not applied for aid in the past but would like to do so now, please contact the Griffin Financial Aid Office to let us know. Deadlines The deadline to renew your aid is May 1 . If you complete your application by the deadline, you will receive your decision notification through my.harvard by July 1 . If your application is incomplete at the deadline, we will notify you via your college email account. Once your aid application is complete, the financial aid decision will be released to my.harvard on a rolling basis during the summer. It is the student’s responsibility to keep track of deadlines and respond to requests for missing documents or additional information. The decision process takes time. We urge you to meet our deadlines in order to have aid in place for the fall term. When should I start my application? Don’t leave your application to the last minute. We recommend starting the application no later than the first week of April. Where can I track my application status? Beginning in mid-February, current students should log in to my.harvard.edu to see what materials have been received and what may be missing. Please allow up to a week for materials you have submitted to appear as received. When will I get my award? If your application is complete by our deadline, you will receive your award through my.harvard by July 1. Late applications will be processed as soon as possible after July 1. CSS Profile All applicants must file the online 2024-2025 CSS Profile via the College Board. Make sure to include Harvard as a recipient using the code 3434. If your parents are married or live together, they will file one CSS Profile. If they are separated or divorced, each parent will need to complete their own CSS Profile . If you are an international student who is unable to complete the CSS Profile due to unreliable access in your home country, or if you live in a country from which the College Board cannot process payments, you may submit a paper application found here . What if I make a mistake on the CSS Profile? We’ll update the CSS Profile with your tax information when it gets to IDOC. If you need to make other corrections that won’t naturally be updated by your taxes, you can update your CSS Profile application once by clicking \"Correct Your CSS Profile\" on your CSS Profile Dashboard. IDOC We require submission of tax and other documents through the College Board IDOC Service . Before you can upload your documents to IDOC, you must have completed and submitted the CSS Profile. Once you file your CSS Profile you will receive communication from the College Board that will guide you through the process. Do not submit supporting documents to our office unless you are specifically instructed to do so. All materials need to be sent through IDOC. Gather together all of the following that apply, and submit them to IDOC. Please do not send draft or estimated taxes. For the 2024-2025 year, we need the actual 2022 tax return as filed with the government. If your documents are not in English, please be sure to translate them. Parents’ 2022 income tax document for both parents : for US students, this is usually the signed 1040 Federal Income Tax Return with all pages and schedules, including W-2 Forms . For many international students, this will be whatever documentation of income your parents submit to their national government. If your parents do not file tax returns, please submit a Tax Non-Filer Statement , and whatever documentation they do have, such as a wage statement, salary certificate, or letter from their employer(s) stating annual income. Student’s 2022 income tax document : we may require student tax returns for some students; please check my.harvard to see if we require that you submit this document. Business documents : if either of your parents has an interest in a business or farm, submit the business tax return for each business and/or farm. In the US, this refers to the full 2022 1065 Partnership Return, 1120 S Corporate Return, and 1120 Corporate Return, along with K-1 Statements. Additional information : if you have any unusual expenses or special circumstances to share, feel free to submit a letter with the rest of your documents. Frequently Asked Questions Do I need to submit every page of the tax return? You should include all pages and schedules of your federal or national income tax return. A common mistake is for US students to send only the first two pages of the tax return, leaving out the schedules (for example Schedule 1, Schedule A, Schedule B, etc). You do not need to send copies of state tax returns. Is IDOC's list of required documents definitive? No. IDOC will show only the most common and basic required documents. You should use our list of required documents from this instructions page and from your my.harvard account as your list of required documents. Submit to IDOC anything else as an ‘institution specific required document’ or ‘other document.’ Should I also mail my documents? No. The way to submit your documents is via IDOC. Documents mailed to our office will not complete your application, unless we have specifically asked you to use mail instead of IDOC. What if my financial situation changes? You should still complete your application as instructed. As always, if there are special circumstances of which you would like us to be aware, please include a detailed letter with the materials you submit to IDOC so that your circumstances can be reviewed along with the rest of your required application materials. If your special circumstances relate to a declining income, you’re also welcome to submit your 2023 tax returns to IDOC if you wish. Financial Aid Activity and Demographic Supplement (FAADS) Every student needs to complete the Financial Aid Activity and Demographic Supplement online. This is a short and easy form to complete. It needs to be completed by the student - parents cannot complete this form on behalf of a student. FAFSA The FAFSA is a free form that determines your eligibility for federal aid. Only students who are US Citizens, Permanent Residents, or other eligible non-citizens will file the FAFSA. File the online 2024-2025 FAFSA . Remember to include Harvard’s code E00468 so that we receive the FAFSA. Our Completing the FAFSA page has tips to help you apply. Federal Aid Only If you do not intend to apply for grant aid from the College, but would like us to determine your eligibility for federal funds only (such as Pell Grants, FWSP, or federal loans), you need only to file the FAFSA . Please notify us of your decision to apply only for federal aid by May 1. Frequently Asked Questions What do I do if I'm returning from a leave of absence? If you are returning from a leave of absence, please contact the Financial Aid Office to let us know of your intention to return. Tips for International Students If you don’t have an SSN, you should use your HUID on all forms. If you or your parents file a tax document in your country you will submit this as part of the process. Please submit the full tax submission - not the notice of assessment. If they do not file a tax document, please submit whatever documentation of income they do have, such as a wage statement or letter from their employer(s). If your documents are not in English, be sure to translate them. Related Topics How to complete the FAFSA Tips on how to complete the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

Last Updated: April 25, 2:24pm Close Alert Open Alert: Harvard Yard Closed to the Public Dual Programs of Study for Music Breadcrumb Home - Academics - Liberal Arts & Sciences - Dual Programs of Study for Music On This Page: Overview Programs New England Conservatory Berklee College of Music Overview For Musical Academics or Academic Musicians If you are a talented musician and dedicated scholar, choosing between in-depth music training and a liberal arts education can be a tough decision. With Harvard's dual programs of study with New England Conservatory (NEC) and Berklee College of Music, you can have the best of both worlds. Programs The dual programs of study allow students to receive a bachelor's degree from Harvard College and take private lessons and preparatory classes at New England Conservatory or Berklee . Students taking part in the Harvard-NEC dual degree program will pursue a bachelor's degree at Harvard followed by a master's degree at NEC. Students taking part in the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program will complete Harvard’s bachelor’s requirements in their four years and then have the option to apply to the Berklee master's program. New England Conservatory The Harvard/NEC program is a 5-year dual degree program in which a student earns a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (S.B.) at Harvard College and a Master of Music (M.M.) at New England Conservatory . Conservatory Program Overview During your first three years, you will take studio instruction each semester at NEC, but you will focus on your academic coursework at Harvard. In your fourth year of study, you will complete your degree requirements at Harvard and begin to fulfill NEC’s Master of Music (M.M.) degree requirements, which you will finish in your fifth year of study. Admission The program is open to high school students who apply to both institutions through the normal admissions process. You must apply to both Harvard and NEC, indicating on both applications your interest in the Harvard-NEC dual degree option. If you are admitted to both institutions, you will then receive an additional decision for admission to the dual degree program. Admission to the NEC Dual Degree Program guarantees admission to the NEC Master of Music degree program. NEC does not offer an early action program but has a regular action deadline of December 1. Performance applicants will be expected to audition at NEC during the regular auditions period in February/March. Composition applicants will be expected to interview at NEC during February/March if invited after review of scores and recordings. Find out more at the Department of Music at Harvard (617-495-2791) or the Office of Admissions at New England Conservatory (617-585-1101). For more information, you may also contact: Harvard University Peter Charig, Undergraduate Program Coordinator Pcharig@fas.harvard.edu New England Conservatory of Music Richard Giarusso, Dean of Academic Affairs Richard.giarusso@necmusic.edu Berklee College of Music The Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program is designed for musicians who are interested in building a foundation for their artistic careers at Berklee , while attaining a liberal arts education at Harvard. Berklee Program Overview The Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program allows students to take courses at Berklee while pursuing their undergraduate degree at Harvard.  Students receive their undergraduate degree at Harvard after 4 years and then have the option to apply for a master’s degree at Berklee. Joint Studies students complete the full requirements of the Harvard A.B. or S.B. degree, including all general education requirements and all the requirements for the Harvard concentration of their choice.  As part of their Harvard curriculum, students may take classes at Berklee. Students begin by taking private instruction on their instrument at Berklee, participating in an ensemble, and taking introductory courses that prepare them for more advanced offerings within Berklee’s curriculum. From there, students will be allowed to pursue their own interests at Berklee in consultation with Berklee and Harvard advisers. Berklee will give particular attention to preparing students for master’s programs if that is their goal.  Students who are interested in pursuing a master’s program at Berklee must apply for the Berklee master’s program in their final year at Harvard. Upon graduation from the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies program students receive a bachelor’s degree from Harvard but no degree from Berklee. Admission The Joint Studies program is open to high school students who apply to both institutions through the normal admissions process. You must apply to both Harvard and Berklee, indicating on both applications your interest in the Harvard-Berklee Joint Studies option. If you are admitted to both institutions, you will then receive an additional decision for the Joint Studies program. Berklee students are allowed to apply early to both Harvard and Berklee. They will receive their general admission decisions from both in December, but they will not receive their decision from Berklee about the Joint Studies program until the spring. Admission to the Joint Studies program does not guarantee admission to the master’s program. Students must apply for the master’s program in their final year at Harvard. Find out more at the Department of Music at Harvard University (617-495-2791) or contact the Office of Admissions at Berklee College of Music at 800-237-5533 or admissions@berklee.com .

Last Updated: April 25, 2:24pm Close Alert Open Alert: Harvard Yard Closed to the Public Breadcrumb Home - Guides Application Tips We're here to help To apply for admission as a first-year or transfer student at Harvard, you will start with the Application. Fill out the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir (choose one, we have no preference), followed by the supplement to help us get a better sense of who you are. Not sure where to start? We've gathered some helpful tips on how to fill out the main application and the Harvard supplement. Profile The Profile section is a place where you'll share detailed information about yourself, including contact information, demographics, and fee waiver request. It's always a good idea to review the information here and update any details, if necessary. Please note that none of the demographic questions in this section are required. Profile Section Personal Information: Legal Name Please fill out your name exactly as it will show up on all materials we receive for your application. Your teachers, college counselors and others should also use your legal name just as it will appear on your financial aid forms, official test score reports, etc. Use of a nickname can cause your application to be incomplete if we cannot match your materials to your application. Citizenship Citizenship does not in any way affect your chances of admission or eligibility for financial aid at Harvard. There is no admissions advantage or disadvantage in being a US citizen. This is not the case at all institutions. For students who need a visa to study in the United States, this question is of critical importance: we begin to prepare the forms that qualify you for a visa immediately after acceptance. Any delay in this process can jeopardize your chances of arriving in Cambridge in time to begin the fall semester. U.S. Social Security Number Your U.S. Social Security number is kept strictly confidential and is used solely to match up your admissions and financial aid data if you are applying for aid. U.S. Armed Forces Status The applications of veterans are most welcome and your service is a positive factor in our admissions process. We’re proud to help veterans continue their education by participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program and Service to School’s VetLink program. Learn more about applying as a veteran here . Application Fee Waiver The application fee covers a very small portion of the administrative costs of processing applications. However, if the fee presents a hardship for you or your family, it will be waived. Each applicant applying with a fee waiver should select an option for a need-based fee waiver. Do not let the application fee stand in the way of applying! How to Request an Application Fee Waiver Do not let the admissions application fee prevent you from applying! In the spirit of our honor code , if the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver: Common Application Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\" Complete the fee waiver signature. Coalition Application Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile. If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9 Transfer Applicants Please send an email to adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu to request a transfer application fee waiver. Family In the family section, you'll share information about your household, your parents, and any siblings. Most colleges collect this information for demographic purposes. Even if you're an adult or an emancipated minor, you'll need to fill out this section. Household Unknown Parent Answer the questions as honestly and fully as you can, but don’t worry if you and your parent/guardian do not know all of the details about your family. Family Information Part of an admissions officer’s job in reading your application is to understand your background and how these circumstances have affected your upbringing, the opportunities available to you, academic preparation, and other factors relevant to the college admissions process. Family life is an important factor in helping us to learn more about the circumstances and conditions in which you were raised, and how you have made the most of the opportunities provided by your family. We want to understand where you’re coming from, not only in school, but at home as well. Parent Education Parents almost always have a significant effect on students’ lives. Information about parents may indicate challenges you have faced – and overcome. In your essay you might elaborate on your family experiences in a wide variety of ways that can illuminate your character and personal qualities, including the positive aspects of your family life. Education In the Education section is where you will share information about your current school or coursework, academic honors, and future education plans. Here are some tips on commonly asked questions. Interruption in Education It is not uncommon for students to change schools or take time off during high school. While this information will most likely appear on your transcript, hearing directly from you about any interruption in schooling will help us to fill in any gaps. Grades We always defer to the secondary school report for information about grades. If yours is not provided by the counselor or school, we will take into consideration what is self-reported, making sure to confirm with your school officials. Current or Most Recent Year Courses Please list the courses you are currently taking and/or are planning on taking before you graduate. If your schedule changes after you have submitted your application, please keep us updated by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal. Honors & Level(s) of Recognition This is a place to highlight any achievements or awards you have received. If you receive any significant honors or awards after submitting the application, you may notify us by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal and we will include this information with your application materials. Future Plans & Career Interest You do not need to have a ten year plan, but getting a sense of what kinds of professions you have considered gives us insight into your current plans. Don’t fret about it: put a few ideas down and move on with your application. Since there are some students who do have a developed career interest already established while they are in high school, this question provides an opportunity to indicate such a plan. Testing The Testing section is where you'll enter your self-reported scores for any standardized tests that you've taken and wish to report to colleges. However, remember that if you self-report your SAT or ACT test scores and you are admitted and choose to enroll at Harvard, you'll be required to submit your official score reports from the College Board or ACT. View more information on our standardized testing requirements on our Application Requirements page. Tests Taken Test Scores We have always looked at the best scores applicants choose to submit. If you haven’t yet taken the tests, please indicate which tests you are taking and when. TOEFL The TOEFL is not required for Harvard, but if you are taking it for another college, you may elect to submit it as part of your Harvard application. Your score can be one more piece of evidence regarding your English language proficiency, so you may choose to submit it if you feel it provides additional helpful information. AP/IB Tests These exam scores are additional pieces of academic information which can help us as we think about your preparation and potential for college level work. Sometimes AP or IB scores can demonstrate a wide range of academic accomplishments. If you have the opportunity to take AP and IB exams, the results may also be helpful for academic placement, should you be accepted and choose to enroll at Harvard. Activities The activities section gives you the opportunity to tell schools more about who you are and activities you're involved with outside the classroom. You'll have the opportunity to list up to ten activities, but that doesn't mean you need to enter all ten. How we use extracurricular activities and work experience in the admissions process We are much more interested in the quality of students’ activities than their quantity so do not feel you need to fill in the entire grid! Contributions students make to the well-being of their secondary schools, communities and families are of great interest to us. So indicate for us the time you spend and the nature of the contribution to extracurricular activities, the local community, work experiences and help provided to your family. Activities you undertake need not be exotic but rather might show a commitment to excellence regardless of the activity. Such a commitment can apply to any activity in your life and may reflect underlying character and personal qualities. For example, a student can gain a great deal from helping his or her family with babysitting or other household responsibilities or working in a restaurant to help with family or personal expenses. Such experiences are important “extracurricular” activities and can be detailed in the extracurricular section and discussed in essays. Some students list only activities they feel will appear significant to the admissions office, while others endeavor to list every single thing they have ever done. Neither approach is right for everyone. Rather, you should think about the activities (in-school, at home, or elsewhere) that you care most about and devote most of your time doing, and list those. We realize that extracurricular and athletic opportunities are either unavailable or limited at many high schools. We also know that limited economic resources in many families can affect a student’s chances for participation on the school teams, travel teams, or even prevent participation at all due to the costs of the equipment or the logistical requirements of some sports and activities. You should not feel that your chances for admission to college are hindered by the lack of extracurricular opportunities. Rather, our admissions committee will look at the various kinds of opportunities you have had in your lifetime and try to assess how well you have taken advantage of those opportunities. For additional thoughts on extracurricular activities, please refer to this 2009 article in the New York Times: Guidance Office: Answers From Harvard’s Dean, Part 3 . Positions held, honors won, letters earned, or employer In this section, please describe the activity and your level of participation. Please note that your description should be concise, or it may be cut off by the Common Application. Participation Grade Level The grades during which you have participated are important because they help us to understand the depth of your involvement in that activity and your changing interests over time. Not all extracurricular activities must be a four-year commitment for our applicants. Approximate Time Spent We are interested to know how you manage your time and to understand how you balance your life outside of the classroom. Some students dedicate their time to one or two activities, while others spread their time among many. When did you participate We know that students are often active both during the school year and the summer – working, babysitting siblings, enrolling in courses, traveling, playing sports, holding internships, etc. Distinguishing school-year activities from summer activities helps us understand how you have spent your time and taken advantage of opportunities available to you. Plans to participate in college? Harvard is a residential institution, and our students are actively engaged in college life. This section helps us to understand how you might contribute at Harvard. Some students who were involved in several activities during high school choose to narrow their focus in college and/or to try new activities not previously available. What if there's not enough space? Filling out the grid is an act of prioritization: your responses tell us what activities or work experiences are most meaningful to you. And there’s quite a bit of space there, too; almost everyone should be able to convey the breadth and depth of out-of-class commitments on the application. Conversely, please do not feel a need to fill every line! Writing The first section is the personal essay. Harvard requires the submission of the personal essay with your application. We also offer an opportunity to add any additional information. Personal Essay The Common Application essay topics are broad. Please note that Coalition essay questions may differ. While this might seem daunting at first, look at it as an opportunity to write about something you care about, rather than what you think the Admissions Committee wants to hear. The point of the personal statement is for you to have the chance to share whatever you would like with us. Remember, your topic does not have to be exotic to be compelling. Essay topics include: Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you? Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more? Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design. Additional Information Do not feel obligated to fill this space, but some students have used this opportunity to tell us about challenging circumstances in their lives such as illness or other difficulties that may have affected their grades. Any information that can tell us more about the person behind the test scores and grades can be helpful. Harvard Questions Each college or university that is a member of the Common Application and/or the Coalition Application - Powered by Scoir has an opportunity to ask applicants a series of school-specific questions separate from the common part of the application. The Harvard supplement contains a series of questions that help us learn more about your academic, extracurricular, and personal interests. You application is not considered complete until you submit the supplement. General: Applying for Financial Aid Harvard has a need-blind admissions process and applying for aid is never detrimental to your admissions decision. We ask this question because we want to be able to calculate your financial need in advance of our April notification date so that we can send your admission letter and financial aid offer at the same time. One thing to note – not all institutions have such policies. General: Submitting Supplementary Materials Supplementary materials (art slides, music recordings, research papers, etc.) help when they reveal unusual talent. You absolutely do not have to include anything supplementary to gain acceptance to Harvard, and the vast majority of admitted students do not submit supplementary materials with their applications. You can submit art and media files through Slideroom and any documents or articles directly in the Applicant Portal with an uploader tool. Academics: Fields of Study When you select from the full list of Harvard's academic concentrations, you give us a sense of the direction you may choose when it comes time for you to choose a concentration at Harvard in your sophomore year. While we realize that this question is quite similar to the one asked on the Common Application, our own format allows us to fit this information into data fields that Harvard has been collecting for many years. While we know students might well change their minds once they are in college, it is helpful for us to get a sense of their current interests and those academic areas in which they have already spent time and effort. We do not admit students into specific academic programs, and we have no quotas or targets for academic fields. Academics: Future Plans As a liberal arts institution with fifty academic concentrations and more than 450 extracurricular organizations, we expect and encourage our students to explore new opportunities. We understand that as you answer these questions, you may not be entirely sure of your plans, but this information helps us to understand how you might use Harvard. Activities One of the principal ways students meet and educate each other during college is through extracurricular activities. Your answer to this question gives us a better sense of the interests you might bring to college and how definite your academic, vocational, extracurricular or athletic interests might be. This information helps us understand better how you might use Harvard. Of course, one of the best things about a liberal arts education is that plans may change. There is no “right” answer to these questions. Contacts If you have applied to Harvard before, we want to include your previous application with your current one. We also want to have a record of any other involvement at Harvard you may have had, including the Summer School and the Extension School and associated transcripts. This information adds to the context of your present application. It can be helpful for us to note changes in your application—perhaps areas where you have strengthened the academic and/or extracurricular aspects of your candidacy. Writing Supplement The supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world. Required Short Answer Questions Each question has a 200 word limit. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard? Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.

Please note that we don't start sending application acknowledgment emails until mid-September, so if you submit your application very early, you may not receive the email until this time. In the portal, you can: Update your email address, mailing address and other contact information View your personalized application checklist Confirm the testing information we have received Change your financial aid application status If submitting scores, self-report your test scores Change your application round (Restrictive Early Action to Regular Decision) Upload additional documents and materials Withdraw your application Have a Conversation with an Alumni Interviewer Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview. It is not possible to request an interview and we are not able to conduct interviews in Cambridge. If you are contacted by an alumnus/a about scheduling an interview, we hope you will accept this invitation. Ordinarily, your interviewer will reach out to you by email to arrange a time for this conversation. Whether you attend high school in the US or internationally, we try to connect you with an alumnus/a from your area, although this is not always possible. Alumni interviewers usually reach out via their own personal email address or by phone. Should you like to verify that person’s affiliation with the Harvard College Interviewing Program, please call 617-495-1551 or write to college@fas.harvard.edu . Interviews may be conducted via Zoom (or other video conferencing platform), telephone, or in-person depending on public health restrictions in your area - as well as your preferences and those of your interviewer. It is important to note that our alumni interviewers do not have access to your application – they only have your name, your contact information and the name of your high school. Any recording of this conversation is strictly prohibited. A few tips: For virtual interviews, it is best to use a computer for this video conversation and not your cell phone. If this is not possible, let our alumni interviewer know of your constraints and we will do our best to accommodate your circumstances. Alternatively, your interview could be conducted by phone. Be aware of your background and consider using appropriate virtual or neutral options. Try to find a quiet room or space for this conversation and make sure there is no one else in the room. These conversations are always best if you have the opportunity to engage with your alumni interviewer without the distraction of a third party presence. Be yourself and use this opportunity to learn more about the Harvard community from someone who has been a Harvard student. There is no need to dress in formal attire. Consider wearing something you would wear to school. Viewing Your Decision Most importantly, the Applicant Portal is where you'll view your admissions decision. Most applicants receive an email reminding them to check their portal and view their decision about 15 minutes after decisions are released. However, if you are logged in to the portal at the time that decisions are released, you may not receive this email. When you log in, you'll see a crimson-colored banner with \"Status Update\".

Frequently Asked Questions How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions? Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver: Common Application Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “ You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\" Complete the fee waiver signature.

If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9 Transfer Applicants Please see the Transfer Application Requirements for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver. What admissions criteria do you use? There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities. How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application? We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the Applicant Portal .

Frequently Asked Questions How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions? Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver: Common Application Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “ You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\" Complete the fee waiver signature. Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile. If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9 Transfer Applicants Please see the Transfer Application Requirements for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.

We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.

You may send the application supplements at a later date, preferably no later than 2 weeks after the application deadline. October 31 Restrictive Early Action applicants: We request that you submit your required test scores by the end of October. However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration. November 1 Restrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. Also submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released. Early November If you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT). Mid-December Restrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released. January 1 Your portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary. February 1 Notify the Admissions Office ( fileroom@fas.harvard.edu ) if you have not received your application confirmation email. Submit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released.

How and when to submit ACT or SAT scores (for students submitting standardized test scores) You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment. If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed. For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible. You can afford Harvard In just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.* *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future. Frequently Asked Questions How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions? Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision. Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver: Common Application Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “ You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\" Complete the fee waiver signature. Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile. If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9 Transfer Applicants Please see the Transfer Application Requirements for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver. What admissions criteria do you use? There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities. How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application? We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the Applicant Portal .

We combine rigorous academics with a learning-by-doing approach. Our guiding principles Since the first classes were offered in a storage warehouse in Boston’s Back Bay, much has changed about the MIT education: electric lights have replaced oil lamps, mechanical engineering succeeded steam engineering, and students are no longer required to learn French and German ⁠ 01 Though they are offered, of course! in order to graduate. However, the MIT education has always been based on certain principles that guide us even today. These include: a broad and strong foundation in core fields of human knowledge (implemented by the General Institute Requirements) a deep and skillful training in a particular area of expertise (obtained through your major(s) and courses of study) a practical orientation toward solving real-world problems (produced by our research and innovation ) MIT also tends to attract and nurture unconventional thinkers. ⁠ 02 As the <a href=\"https://libraries.mit.edu/mithistory/institute/committees/committee-on-educational-survey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewis Report</a> put it long ago: “We believe that the mission of the Institute should be to encourage initiative, to promote the spirit of free and objective inquiry, to recognize and provide opportunities for unusual interests and aptitudes; in short, to {develop} individuals who will contribute creatively to our society, in this day when strong forces oppose all deviations from set patterns.” This is intentional: we seek students (and faculty) who have courage, creativity, and curiosity, place them in a resource-rich environment, and let them pursue their interests.

We search the world for students who we think will be a good fit at MIT, and try to put together the best team of students to go through MIT together. On your journey, we will surround you with brilliant faculty, helpful graduate students, caring staff, and an idiosyncratic extended family who will inspire and guide you along the way. What follows is a brief overview of some of the kinds of people you’ll find at MIT. We believe the humans of MIT are truly special, and we hope that among them you will find a sense of home. Our undergraduates In any given year there are ~4,500 undergraduates at MIT. They hail from all 50 states and more than 100 countries. The undergraduate population is 52% men and 48% women, and among them there is no majority race or ethnicity . MIT students come from a wide range of economic and educational backgrounds, and has the highest economic mobility index of its peer schools. Long a home for those who felt like they had no other, MIT has one of the oldest LGBTQ+ student groups in the country, as well as several ethnic or cultural affinity houses , and an affirming home for international, undocumented, and trans* students. We wish we could tell you about how awesome our undergrads are. But anything we could tell you would fail to capture it. The next best thing you can do is read the blogs and see for yourself. Graduate students There are more than 6,000 graduate students at MIT. Some of them are MIT alumni, while others come from hundreds of other universities around the nation and the world. Graduate students do not teach undergraduate classes at MIT, but they do serve as academic and social mentors, by leading discussion sections for large classes, or by serving as live-in Graduate Resident Advisors in the residence halls. They’re responsible for providing advice, mediating conflict, and managing stress. Most MIT undergrads will, at some point, pursue a graduate degree, and benefit from having outstanding graduate students closely involved as advisors in their undergraduate education. Faculty MIT has ~1,000 tenured and tenure-track faculty, all of whom teach and conduct research, and ~1,000 members of the academic instructional staff , who possess training and credentials similar to those of faculty members but who are solely dedicated to teaching. There are 11 Nobel Prize Laureates, 24 MacArthur Genius Grant Winners, and one Pulitzer Prize winner among MIT’s current faculty. Jay Keyser, in his book on MIT culture, observed that there is an “incredibly strong bond” between MIT students and faculty, in part, because both students and faculty often realize that they are of like kind, just separated by age and experience. Our faculty see themselves in our students, and our students, in some cases, aspire to become our faculty, or at least to become more like them: smart, hardworking, creative, and accomplished. Staff There are over 5,000 non-academic staff at MIT. They administer majors, support activities , protect campus , provide therapy , deliver mail , hand-letter doors , and, yes, read applications. Drawn initially by the work, many are kept here by their love for the Institute and its humans; indeed, an uncommon number of MIT staff are “lifers,” and a select few have even been made honorary members of the MIT Alumni Association for extraordinary, lifelong service to the Institute. Our values In December 2020, responding to calls from the community that MIT would benefit from having a statement of shared values, the Institute charged the MIT Values Statement Committee to develop one through broad consultation across the MIT community. On April 12, 2022, President Rafael Reif, Provost Cynthia Barnhart, and Chancellor Melissa Nobles shared the values statement with the community, with their strong endorsement. Read more about our shared values . Extended family MIT operates an open campus. The wifi doesn’t require a password, and its museums and libraries are open to the public. This unusual degree of access has deep cultural roots in our longstanding commitment to the public interest . So long as people aren’t bothering anyone, they’re generally welcome on campus. It’s not uncommon to see people without a formal MIT affiliation spending significant time around campus: not just the usual lecturers or tourists, but also local jugglers and fire spinners who have adopted MIT as their institutional home. We’re very happy to have them, and hope that they take some of the values of MIT with them wherever they go.

So what really happens between when you apply and when you receive your decision? Once your application is complete, it will first be read by a senior admissions officer who will consider your application in a holistic manner, within its proper context. Strong applications will then be evaluated by additional admissions officers , who will summarize it for the Admissions Committee. These summaries, along with your entire application, will then go to the selection committee, where multiple groups of different admissions staff and faculty members will weigh in. At least a dozen people will significantly discuss and debate an application before it is placed in the admit pile. Student-centered This is all very intentional. The committee process ensures that every decision is correct in the context of the overall applicant pool, and that no one individual’s biases, preferences, or familiarity with a given case has any chance of swaying a decision unfairly. Our process is a student-centered process, not a school- or region-centered process. This means that we do not read your application along with other students from your school or region to compare you against each other; each applicant stands on their own. We have no quotas by school, state, or region. You are not at any disadvantage if other excellent students from your school or area are also applying. We also do not consider legacy/alumni relations in our process. At MIT, we try to be as transparent as possible about our admissions process. If you have any questions, just ask . You should really read these There have been over 7,080 blog entries posted to MITAdmissions.org since the site began in 2004. That’s easily several books worth of tips and tricks, hints and hacks, mea culpas and hakuna matatas . They’re all worth reading—but there are a few you really need to read. These are the blog entries that cut deep into our admissions process. Not only what we’re looking for, but what we want from you, and how much we care about the work that we do.

The most important way to prepare for MIT is to focus on becoming your best self by pursuing your interests, your aptitudes, and your education. What you shouldn’t do is build your life, your education, and your expectations around the narrow goal of trying to get into MIT. As our Dean Stu Schmill wrote : In simple terms, we want students to pursue the things that interest them with energy and enthusiasm. We want students to make decisions that are educationally sound for them to best prepare them to succeed in college and beyond. We want students to challenge themselves appropriately in the areas that are most interesting to them. We want students to engage with their community in their pursuits. And, we want students who demonstrate strong ethical character. In short, we want young people to be students and community members first, and applicants second. Climbing the mountain We care about community so much because we don’t just admit individuals, we admit a class . It’s as if we’re choosing a 1,100-person team to climb a very interesting, fairly rugged mountain—together. We obviously want people who have the training, stamina, and passion for the climb. At the same time, we want each to add something useful or intriguing to the team, from a wonderful temperament or sense of humor to compelling personal experiences, to a wide range of individual gifts, talents, interests, and achievements. We are emphatically not looking for a batch of identical perfect climbers; we are looking for a richly varied team of capable people who will support, surprise, and inspire each other. Preparing yourself for MIT, then, means doing two things: taking the time to really explore things that interest you, both inside and outside of school making sure you’re ready to do the work Applying sideways Look…we admit less than 10% of applicants. If you set your goal as being admitted to MIT, you’re likely to be disappointed. If, however, you set your goals as learning a lot, developing a better sense of yourself, and being a positive influence on those around you, then you can succeed on your own terms and be a better applicant to MIT. You can think about this approach to preparing for college as applying sideways : one that encourages students to focus on becoming their best self , with the knowledge that it will also help them be a better applicant to colleges that are a good fit for them.

However, there are many ways to define the best, and we think it’s important that young people be students and community members first, and applicants second. As our Dean of Admissions, Stu Schmill ’86, wrote in a blog post : In simple terms, we want students to pursue the things that interest them with energy and enthusiasm. We want students to make decisions that are educationally sound for them to best prepare them to succeed in college and beyond. We want students to challenge themselves appropriately in the areas that are most interesting to them. We want students to engage with their community in their pursuits. And, we want students who demonstrate strong ethical character. We don’t want students to do things just because they think they have to. We don’t want students to take advanced classes out of a sense of competition, rather than the joy of learning. We don’t want a laundry list of a million activities. And we don’t want students sacrificing quality for quantity–something that is happening far too often. We also don’t want students who have other responsibilities (taking care of siblings or working 20-30 hours a week to support their family), or who come from school districts with limited resources and fewer advanced course offerings, to feel like they are not going to be strongly considered for admission because of their circumstances. And we don’t want this push for quantity to crowd out interest in the common good. Because when you get to college–this is especially true at MIT–engaging and collaborating with others is the foundation of our culture and community. As such, we encourage you to first and foremost help your students become their best possible selves . It could be helping them find enrichment opportunities , or helping them remember to take some time off and just have fun (or both!).

Net Price Calculator The Net Price Calculator is a tool designed by the College Board to help you assess what your eligibility for financial aid might be and estimate your out-of-pocket expenses. The Net Price Calculator will give you an estimate of your net cost and aid eligibility, but your ultimate financial aid package will be determined by the MIT financial aid office. Completing the calculator should take no more than 20 minutes of your time. You will need to answer some basic questions about your family’s financial situation, so it might be helpful to have recent tax forms or pay stubs on hand before you begin. Things to note Both tools are designed for first-time, full-time students. They will not be accurate for international students or federally independent students. Results may be less accurate for families who are divorced or separated, and families who have ownership in a business. Special circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis once you apply for financial aid.

Since folks at the Institute are always making, writing, and discovering new things—whether on campus or off—there’s more than enough to explore from home. Consider this your starting point as you get to know MIT. Let’s get started At the bottom of each page—starting with this one—you’ll find a link to the next stop in this virtual-MIT-choose-your-own-adventure experience. While we recommend reading through each page at least once, we hope you click any link and watch any video that piques your interest. (And if several clicks later you find that you’ve fallen down your own rabbit hole deep into the digital MIT universe…we consider that a success.) We’ve written pretty extensively about each of these topics elsewhere on our site, and you’ll find those pages linked in the headers. When in doubt, check the blogs ; out of more than 7,080 posts, there’s likely one that covers whatever you’re curious about. Up first? Academics. Academics MIT’s academic program is as much about developing new ideas and solving problems as it is about mastering course material. As our motto “mind and hand” ⁠ 01 the official motto is actually Latin, “mens et manus” suggests, our learning philosophy is rooted in marrying knowledge with action—whether designing, building, and presenting new products from scratch or conducting professional-level research through MIT’s extensive undergraduate research programs. MIT invites students to act upon their knowledge to solve problems that transform society for the better.

By the time students graduate from MIT, 94% of them have conducted research—for pay or for credit—during their undergraduate years through UROP. Maker education We were serious about the mens et manus thing. With more than 130,000 square feet of makerspaces—and more on the way—MIT supports any student interested in making, whether novice or expert.

You can learn more in the Visit MIT section of our site. The Welcome Center is open from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Admissions at the MIT Welcome Center 292 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 Getting to the Welcome Center The MBTA’s Red Line is your best option to get to the Welcome Center! Depending on where you are coming from, you could also walk, bike, take the bus , or maybe a taxi/rideshare. We strongly encourage visitors not to drive to campus. Cambridge traffic is usually awful, the layout of the roads is confusing, and, although there is public parking at the Hayward Parking Garage, and other public lots in Kendall Square , it is pretty expensive and unpredictably limited. If you are driving to the area, we strongly, strongly encourage you to park further out on the Red Line and take the train from there. In addition to being faster, cheaper, and better for the environment, you can conveniently visit many other colleges along the way! If you must drive to campus itself , then your best bet is to set your address for the Hayward Parking Garage, accessible at 33 Amherst Street, and keep your fingers crossed. 🤞 Please note: MIT Admissions cannot reimburse parking costs. Hooray for maps! Behold, whereis.mit.edu . Just search for rooms (“welcome center”, “E38”), services (“public parking”) or whatever else you might need!

We understand that high schools have different offerings and families have different resources. It is our job as admissions officers to sift through that context and admit those students who are the best matched with MIT. Academics An MIT education combines deeply analytic thinking with creative hands-on problem-solving to prepare students to solve the toughest problems in the world. Our General Institute Requirements demand that all students must take (or place out of, through our credit policies or an Advanced Standing Examination ) the following: Two semesters of calculus Two semesters of calculus-based physics One semester of chemistry One semester of biology In addition to these subjects, students are also required to take a robust set of humanities, arts, and social science classes, regardless of what course of study they choose to pursue. A strong academic foundation in high school contributes to your own development, improves your odds of getting into MIT, and helps you make the most of the Institute when you’re here. Because a strong foundation in math is so central, and we find prior familiarity with physics to be important for success, students should have math through calculus and at least one year of physics. Students who are well matched with MIT take the following classes in high school: Math, through calculus One year or more of physics One year or more of chemistry One year or more of biology Four years of English Two years of a foreign language Two years of history and/or social sciences In general, what you take should be based on your interests and aptitudes . That is, you should focus on taking the most challenging courses available to you in the areas that most interest you. We know that not all high schools offer the chance to take all these recommended classes, and we take this into consideration when reviewing your application. As we’ve said above, having a strong foundation in math—especially calculus, the building block for many of our courses—is essential to a student’s success at MIT. If you don’t have access to a calculus class through your high school, there are many ways to access advanced math curricula and demonstrate your knowledge, including: Dual-enrollment opportunities at local colleges or universities , including community colleges Enrollment at virtual high schools or structured programs, such as SPCS , CTY , and VHS Learning Certification through Khan Academy and Schoolhouse.world ; you can take a free online calculus course with Khan Academy, receive free tutoring through Schoolhouse, and then take a free exam through Schoolhouse to receive a certification transcript Certification through accredited online courses, such as MITx Online’s Calculus 1A: Differentiation , Calculus 1B: Integration , and Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems & Infinite Series Reporting scores for exams such as AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, IB Mathematics HL, or CLEP Calculus that you self-studied; there are many free study resources online, such as Khan Academy , MIT OpenCourseWare , and MIT Open Learning Library Additional academic enrichment If your high school doesn’t offer courses that challenge you, you may want to explore other options, such as dual-enrollment opportunities at local colleges or enrollment in virtual high school options. You will be able to report any courses that you take outside of your high school on your application. OpenCourseWare MIT OpenCourseWare provides users with open access to the syllabi, lecture notes, course calendars, problem sets and solutions, exams, and even a selection of video lectures from courses representing ∼34 departments. Other resources Khan Academy , ⁠ 01 Khan Academy is now recognized by the College Board as their official test preparation source, fully integrated with their suite of assessments. offers personalized—and free—SAT test prep. Founded by MIT alum, Sal Khan, Khan Academy offers world-class instruction to anyone, anywhere, online. Their personalized practice recommendations will help you build your own practice plan, let you take practice tests, and give you tips for taking the test. They also offer AP prep, should you be considering AP exams. MIT Open Learning publishes materials from OCW, MITx, and other non-degree granting courses and enrichment programs, including hands-on STEM activities . There are more structured online environments that function more like traditional classrooms, with assigned homework, regular chat periods, an instructor, grades, and so forth. You may be able to get high school (and sometimes college) credit through these programs. Some of them include SPCS , CTY , and VHS Learning . Many of our students who are mathematically inclined have found Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) an indispensable resource. Extracurricular activities Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. We ask for only four activities on our application because we want to know what you are passionate about, what is most important to you—not what you think we want to see. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. You should find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. We also recognize that some students may have family or other obligations that might be what they do outside of classes. And that’s okay, we just want to learn more about you, whatever that might be! There is no “right” answer. College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try. Khan Academy is now recognized by the College Board as their official test preparation source, fully integrated with their suite of assessments. ⁠ back to text ↑ More in Preparing for MIT Be yourself!

Here are the key components: Alignment with MIT’s mission Remember that there are many ways to make the world better—we’re not looking for applicants to have cured all infectious disease in the world by the time they’re 15. Tutoring a single kid in math changes the world. Lobbying a senator to amend bad policy changes the world. There are thousands of examples. Collaborative and cooperative spirit The core of the MIT spirit is collaboration and cooperation; you can see it all over the Institute. Many of the problem sets (our affectionate term for homework) at MIT are designed to be worked on in groups, and cross-department labs are very common. MIT is known for its interdisciplinary research—passionate people working across their differences to tackle big questions and challenges together. If you enjoy working alone all the time, that’s completely valid, but you might not be particularly happy at MIT. Initiative Opportunities are abundant at MIT, but they must be seized. Research projects, seed money, and interesting lectures aren’t simply handed to students on silver platters here. For those students who take initiative—who take advantage of what’s around them—MIT’s resources are unparalleled. Risk-taking MIT wants to admit people who are not only planning to succeed but who are also not afraid to fail. When people take risks in life, they learn resilience—because risk leads to failure as often as it leads to success. The most creative and successful people—and MIT is loaded with them—know that failure is part of life and that if you stay focused and don’t give up, goals are ultimately realized. Hands-on creativity MIT is an active, hands-on place. Innovation is risky and messy! Getting your hands dirty and trying something new is often the best way to achieve success. We apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems here; our Latin motto means “Mind and Hand.” In other words, you shouldn’t just enjoy thinking, you should also enjoy doing. Intensity, curiosity, and excitement In a nutshell, you should be invested in the things that really mean something to you (we’re not particularly picky as to what). Explore! Choose quality over quantity—you don’t have to do a million things to get into college. Put your heart into a few things that you truly care about and that will be enough. The character of the MIT community Our community is comprised of thoughtful people from a wide variety of backgrounds and worldviews who take care of each other and lift each other up; they inspire each other to work and dream beyond their potential. Students regularly work alongside faculty and staff to shape MIT policies and further our mission to make the world a better place. We’re looking to admit people who feel responsible to their communities and will help sustain the heart of MIT’s. The ability to prioritize balance Despite what you may have heard, this place is NOT all about work. To be successful here, you must prioritize some measure of downtime. Therefore, we like to see that you’ve prioritized some downtime in high school as well. Our application’s essay question (Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it.) is not a trick question. Answer it honestly.

'18 Guest post by Katy Kem '16 April 5, 2016 in Athletics , MIT Life , People & Identities Hello everybody! My name is Katy and I’m a senior studying electrical engineering (6-1). Joel has kindly let me write a blog post for him about my favorite thing about MIT – the ski team! For those of you who don’t know, at MIT the month of January is not part of the normal school year. Instead, we have Independent Activities Period (IAP). During IAP students can choose to take condensed classes, conduct research, work on projects, work at an externship, travel, or really whatever the hell they want. I prefer to spend the duration of IAP with the MIT Alpine Ski team, living in a cabin in New Hampshire, and skiing all day every day. Yeah, I’m pretty much living the dream. I’ve always been a somewhat cautious person, or to put it another way, a total wuss. I avoid compromising situations, whether it be going to a party where I don’t know many people, or refusing to try a back dive off the board even when all the younger kids do it no problem. I guess you could say I have a finely tuned fight or flight (mostly flight) response. Freshman year, I avoided committing to extracurriculars, and the ones I did attempt didn’t really feel right. Desperate for something to distract myself from endless psets, I joined the Ski Team completely on a whim Sophomore Fall. I’d always enjoyed skiing growing up, though I’d never competed or formally trained in any way. As Winter Break drew to a close and the start of the season approached, I began to panic. WHAT WAS I THINKING I CAN’T SKI RACE . I didn’t even really know anybody on the team! I had no idea what to expect. I’d already paid team dues, bought a race license, and two new(ish) pairs of skis though, one for each event I’d be skiing (slalom & giant slalom), so I was committed. Here goes nothing . We only had 3 short training days before our first race of the season (my first race ever!!!), but luckily I had two incredibly awesome and supportive ski coaches to show me the ropes – Ben ’07 and JC ’05. Naturally, I picked it up immediately. I’m a bit of a skiing savant. I mean, just look at me shred. Rule #1: Look good. Rule #2: Ski Fast. Rule #3: Safety Third HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH JUST KIDDING I WAS TRULY HORRENDOUS. As a club sport, the MIT ski team accepts any confident skier, which means that at least half the team has little to no ski racing experience. We do have some people on the team who have raced previously and are pretty good though! (Shoutout to Mikey, whose body my head is subtly photoshopped onto above.) The first race of my ski racing career arrived incredibly quickly – after only 3 days of practice and less than one day in actual gates (the things we ski around), I was deposited on the top of an icy race course at Okemo, scared out of my mind. I frantically texted my dad on the verge of tears, sincerely regretting ever signing up. Somehow I managed to get myself through the start gate. I have no memory of that first race, but I must have made it down in one piece. I may have been DFL (dead [redacted] last), but I’D JUST SKI RACED. I was so, so proud of myself. If you want to get better at something fast, do it six hours a day, six days a week, for several weeks in a row. It’s hard to find words to describe how much better I’ve gotten at skiing since that first week. Let’s just say that I’m an unrecognizable skier. I obviously still have a long way to go before I turn pro (I’m so much better than them) (that was a Gnar reference I’m not actually better), but I’ve improved so much. Not without a lot of hard work though. Every morning during the season, we wake up at 7:15 am, scarf down some eggs and oatmeal, grab our gear and head out the door. We drive to our home turf, Ragged Mountain (also Chris Peterson’s home mountain!!!), and we’re on the first lift at 9am. We ski for most of the day, doing some combination of freeskiing, drills, and running practice courses. With a break for lunch, when we eat grilled sandwiches (ALL HAIL THE GEORGE FOREMAN), we often ski ‘til the mountain closes at 4pm. We head back to the cabin, go on a run, and then do a core workout. Each night, a different team member takes a turn at being head chef and cooking dinner for the entire team. It’s a very important job – we eat a lot. The rest of the team tunes their skis, or just enjoys each other’s company. Improvement took more than just hours spent skiing – it took falling. A lot. Lots of falling. Falling every day. I spend most of ski season with big, purple bruises on my hips. My first year on the team, I didn’t make it down back to back slalom runs all season. I fell every time. But each time I picked myself up and I put whatever gear back on I’d inevitably left strewn about the slope, and kept going. Ski team taught me how to fall. One of my most spectacular wipeouts wasn’t during the season. Sophomore spring, some ski teamers and I decided to conquer the legendary Tuckerman’s Ravine – famous back country ski route in the White Mountains. We woke up early in the morning, strapped our skis to our backs, and hiked several hours up Mount Washington to get to the Tuckerman’s Bowl. The hike up is worth the ski down Johannes and Ben conquer the bowl Climbing up that bowl was utterly terrifying. It was so steep I had to kick my ski boots into the face to make little ice shelves. Halfway up I started hyperventilating I was so scared. I eventually made it up to a spot flat enough to put on my skis. We hadn’t started our hike early enough, so by the time we got up there, the slushy spring snow had started to crust over with ice as the sun sank. I took one turn, hit an ice bump, my ski popped off, and I screaming tomahawked down the length of the bowl – at least a 20 second fall – before finally coming to a stop. When I arrived at Ring Delivery a few days later in my cute short dress, it looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to my legs. Score 1 Mount Washington. Of course, it wouldn’t be the MIT ski team if we didn’t put our engineering skills to good use. Last year, then team Captain, Val (MIT ’15) and I decided we wanted to make a lightsuit, inspired by the Afterglow Lightsuit Segment video . (Watch it – seriously breathtaking). We bought a large black hoodie from Walmart, several LED strips, and a massive battery, and spent much of our free time that season sewing LEDs and sketchily soldering in the poor light. It turned out pretty awesome! We were a huge hit while night skiing at Pat’s Peak, and even took it to Beacon Hill in Boston for some street skiing laps during last year’s Snowmageddon! MIT ski urban segment We race in the McConnell Division in the Northeast, which is USCSA, and we have 10 races in the regular season – two per weekend. We race the tech events, which are slalom and giant slalom, and four of our races this year were FIS, which means we raced against great racers not in our league as well! It’s tradition in our league (and many other leagues) for seniors to dress up and race their final slalom race in costume. This year, 5 out of 13 of our racers were seniors, so we decided to do something extra special. We spent many hours hand sanding molds out of dense green foam, and pulled some pseudo all-nighters in the Edgerton Center thermoforming and laser cutting when we probably should have been psetting, but in the end it was all worth it. We took over Pat’s Peak by storm(troopers). I’m Luke Ski-walker, I’m here to rescue you! We race at a number of different mountains all over New England. They range from the tiny, T-bar served hill at Proctor Academy, to the notoriously steep & icy run at Whiteface – the same hill they raced on in the 1980 Olympics, affectionately called “IceFace.” As we travel all over the Northeast we make sure to do our duty and test and rank as many breakfast sandwiches at rest stops and ski lodges as possible. Make sure if you’re in New Hampshire you check out Jake’s Market and Deli’s “special:” egg, cheese, shaved steak & onion on a Portuguese muffin. To die for . Skiing doesn’t end when the season ends! For spring break two years ago and this year, the majority of the team traveled to Lake Tahoe together, where we stayed and skied at Squaw Valley for the week. I just got back from this year’s trip last week, and it was probably the best skiing I’ve ever had. We had a pow day early in the week and got fresh tracks through the glades in several places, and finished out the week with a day skiing in our swimsuits at Heavenly (spring break wooo!) I also skied the scariest thing I’ve ever skied in my life. There’s a rock formation at Squaw called the Palisades, and it’s about a 10 minute hike up from one of the lifts. Between these rocks are a number of steep chutes. Somehow I let my teammates talk me into doing it. I stood at the edge, looking at the “slope” below. It was pretty much straight down! My heart was beating out of my chest. I gathered myself and went, and somehow by some miracle remained standing! I successfully skied the Main Chute of the Palisades! Hyped on adrenaline I decided to go again. This time, more confident, I decided to try to take a straighter line. I dropped in, with my teammate Sophia Wu dropping in in the adjacent chute at the exact same moment unbeknownst to me. We simultaneously fell, lost skis, and tumbled down the face. Of course, the one where I made it down there’s no footage to prove it, but there’s a full video of the one where I ate it. You can watch the spectacle below (I’m the one on the right). Yes that’s me screaming, yes the sound carried to everyone on the mountain, yes I’m a tad ashamed. Despite the wipeout, the Palisades were a big deal for me. There’s no way in hell two years ago Katy would have skied that. Ski team has become such a huge part of my life at MIT I have trouble imagining what my college experience would be without it. During the season, all my worries fall away. I don’t think about psets or classes or grad school or jobs or anything – I eat, ski, sleep, and repeat. It’s like a month long therapeutic retreat. When I ski, I don’t think, my mind goes blank and I feel the icy wind on my face and the rhythmic turns. It’s pure joy. I’m not a very good racer, I will never be competitive in my league, but I don’t care. There aren’t many activities that are so inherently fun that even if you suck and fail you keep coming back for more with a grin on your face. The song that best describes my three years on the ski team is Chumbawumba’s “Tubthumping.” I get knocked down, but I get up again. I’m so glad I joined the team on a whim and got over my fears to actually do it. It’s the best decision I’ve made at MIT, and I’m so lucky to have had this experience.

Actually, Duluth is neither perpetually frozen nor technically tundra, but it sometimes feels like that, especially in “winter”, which is a season that we Minnesotans have that consists of all 364 days that are not the Fourth of July. In case you haven’t noticed, I love long sentences. They’re like tail end recursion, only with more synonyms. Other things that I love include: 0) xkcd comics, which I obsessively memorize 1) computing, which is what hipsters call programming now 2) hackathons 3) the 3rd movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata 4) pronouncing ‘sauna’ with a ‘w’ (“SOW-nuh”), because that’s what Minnesotans do, and 5) inventing conjugations that totally should exist, like “clapter”, which is an abstract collection of simultaneous individual claps. If I use strange words that you haven’t seen before, I probably made them up. Also, the reason I insert all those right parentheses after my numbers is to bring harmony to the unresolved tension that xkcd.com/859/ left us with.

My heart was beating out of my chest. I gathered myself and went, and somehow by some miracle remained standing! I successfully skied the Main Chute of the Palisades! Hyped on adrenaline I decided to go again. This time, more confident, I decided to try to take a straighter line. I dropped in, with my teammate Sophia Wu dropping in in the adjacent chute at the exact same moment unbeknownst to me. We simultaneously fell, lost skis, and tumbled down the face. Of course, the one where I made it down there’s no footage to prove it, but there’s a full video of the one where I ate it. You can watch the spectacle below (I’m the one on the right). Yes that’s me screaming, yes the sound carried to everyone on the mountain, yes I’m a tad ashamed. Despite the wipeout, the Palisades were a big deal for me. There’s no way in hell two years ago Katy would have skied that. Ski team has become such a huge part of my life at MIT I have trouble imagining what my college experience would be without it. During the season, all my worries fall away. I don’t think about psets or classes or grad school or jobs or anything – I eat, ski, sleep, and repeat. It’s like a month long therapeutic retreat. When I ski, I don’t think, my mind goes blank and I feel the icy wind on my face and the rhythmic turns. It’s pure joy. I’m not a very good racer, I will never be competitive in my league, but I don’t care. There aren’t many activities that are so inherently fun that even if you suck and fail you keep coming back for more with a grin on your face. The song that best describes my three years on the ski team is Chumbawumba’s “Tubthumping.” I get knocked down, but I get up again. I’m so glad I joined the team on a whim and got over my fears to actually do it. It’s the best decision I’ve made at MIT, and I’m so lucky to have had this experience.

Just my thoughts ———– Thanks Matt ;-) ______________________________________________________________________________________ From Cattaraugus Reservation To MIT CATTARAUGUS INDIAN RESERVATION – A Western New York teen is one of only 1,000 high school seniors across the nation to have earned a Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Foundation Scholarship. And he comes from a place where college just isn’t in the cards for many kids. Judd Logan was prepared to accepted a full academic scholarship to Syracuse University, until the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology offered a similar deal. So in less than a month Logan will pack his bags for Boston. It is not surprising that scholarship offers of such magnitude would come to someone like Logan. He did after all attain a 98.9 grade point average before graduating second in his class at Gowanda High School. Nonetheless, Logan is going where very few from his home have, as a resident of the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation. “I don’t know many people anywhere that went to MIT, so he’s a pretty big fish in a little pond right now, ” said his mother Lisa Maybee, who like her son grew up on the reservation and has called it home for her entire life save for a stint in the military. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 13% percent of children who grow up on American Indian reservations attain a four-year college degree. Logan would like to be a computer scientist or engineer. But after earning his degree he would also like to return to live on the reservation where, according to the U.S Census Bureau, 42% of people his age and younger live in poverty. “I want to leave and experience everything and then bring my experience back and say (to kids) if I can do it, surely there’s other people who can,” Logan told WGRZ-TV. It is remarks like that which make his already proud mother even more proud of her son. “That’s something we both feel strongly about, …returning something back to the community … giving some people some inspiration. He’s amazing and I just don’t know where it comes from but that’s just who Judd is,” she said. With MIT extending Logan a full-ride, he didn’t need the Gates Millennium Foundation scholarship he was also awarded to pay for his undergraduate degree. But the foundation has notified him that it will be kept in reserve for him to use for graduate school.

Then you come across a channel that catches your attention. A brilliantly parodied logo appears on the screen as the narrator’s voice warmly speaks “Welcome back to MIT Planet”. a parody of Animal Planet This week on MIT Planet, we look at three large hackathons of the fall season. Hackathons are a plenty at MIT all throughout the year, but the weekend of Oct 3-5 saw three different hackathons over the course of three days. MIT students as well as other students from all over the country flocked to MIT to compete in these three hackathons: HackMIT, Hacking Arts, and MIT’s Maker Faire. We will observe each one more closely. HackMIT HackMIT is MIT’s premiere and most prestigious hackathon. Every year, usually on the first weekend of October, MIT students and non-MIT students alike compete to think up and build innovative software and hardware projects over the span of 24 hours. Throughout the week leading up to HackMIT, companies ranging from the likes of Facebook and Google to smaller companies like Fitbit and Pebble provided their own prizes and held workshops on how students could use their resources and API’s on their HackMIT projects.

MIT Mini Maker Faire Already covered extensively by Ceri in her excellent post MIT Mini Maker Faire , I won’t go into much detail except that the Make Faire is an event organized by MAKE magazine to “celebrate the spirit of creation”. This was the very first MIT Mini Maker Faire ever and it was a huge success My personal favorite part of the MIT Mini Maker Faire was the Robotic Combat Tournament, which my friend John P. ’17 placed first in. You can view more photos of the MIT Mini Maker Faire on their Facebook page. Hacking Arts Hacking Arts is a festival and hackathon that aims to create new opportunities for artists, engineers, business people, and entrepreneurs alike to collaborate and present their works. The event was full of presentations, exhibits, competitions, a fashion show, and even musical performances from Grammy nominated artists. Hacking Arts is run by student organizers and this was the second year it has been done. Photo creds to: HackingArts You can see all of the photos from Hacking Arts on their Facebook page.

Every year, usually on the first weekend of October, MIT students and non-MIT students alike compete to think up and build innovative software and hardware projects over the span of 24 hours. Throughout the week leading up to HackMIT, companies ranging from the likes of Facebook and Google to smaller companies like Fitbit and Pebble provided their own prizes and held workshops on how students could use their resources and API’s on their HackMIT projects.

MIT Mini Maker Faire Already covered extensively by Ceri in her excellent post MIT Mini Maker Faire , I won’t go into much detail except that the Make Faire is an event organized by MAKE magazine to “celebrate the spirit of creation”. This was the very first MIT Mini Maker Faire ever and it was a huge success My personal favorite part of the MIT Mini Maker Faire was the Robotic Combat Tournament, which my friend John P. ’17 placed first in. You can view more photos of the MIT Mini Maker Faire on their Facebook page. Hacking Arts Hacking Arts is a festival and hackathon that aims to create new opportunities for artists, engineers, business people, and entrepreneurs alike to collaborate and present their works. The event was full of presentations, exhibits, competitions, a fashion show, and even musical performances from Grammy nominated artists. Hacking Arts is run by student organizers and this was the second year it has been done. Photo creds to: HackingArts You can see all of the photos from Hacking Arts on their Facebook page. That’s all for this week on MIT Planet.

'23 CJ Q. '23 Courses 18 & 6-3 [email protected] Biography What does it take to get to know someone? I've written three hundred thousand words in these blog posts, and I don't think that's enough. I'll save you the effort to learn the basics, at least: my name is CJ, I graduated in 2023, I grew up in the Philippines, and while in MIT, I lived in East Campus. We could talk about the things I like, or, at least, the things I used to like. I've written thirteen versions of this bio before, and in them I listed these things: board games and video games, typography and logic puzzles, type theory and syntax, meditation and interactive fiction. I don't know when you're reading this. Days from now, months from now, years? I don't know how my likes would've shifted. Or we could go on an adventure. Of my favorite places in and around MIT, some are still there, some are renamed, some are long gone. Does it make my writing less useful, that it refers to places that may one day disappear? The things that made my dorm room special lie in junkyards, but there'll always be special dorm rooms here. The places I can show you may not be here, but it was never about the places, wasn't it? We could sit. We could talk. We could talk about all the people we miss, and all the things we hold dear, and all the reasons to love, and all the ways to live forever. And maybe it'd get quiet enough that I forget, for a moment, how old I am. And maybe you'd feel the same way. And then we could tell each other stories. But until then, I hope you enjoy reading mine.

'09 Questions and views, and questions about views. The views are not necessarily questionable, although you can ask questions about them. I'll stop trying to confuse you now. September 18, 2005 in MIT Life , Residential Life It’s Q&A time! Ajit asked: “who is the person in the 5th picture from top.roommate?i have few questions- 1.how many students(UG) share a room in the halls/dorms generally? 2.are there different halls for boys and girls /they live in a single hall but different rooms.are they allowed to live in a single room?” There are actually two people in the picture you mention- the girl painting is April, my roommate. The guy sitting on the bed is Ace, April’s friend who came to watch us do all of the work like a true gentleman. He’s just a visitor- he doesn’t actually live with us. About the number of people who share a room, freshmen generally do most of the sharing. (I don’t know much about how it works after freshman year.) Freshmen in most dorms are in doubles. One notable exception is Baker , where some rooms are designated as triples and quads. There are mixed feelings about the quads- some people love them and some people hate them. I suppose that really depends on who you end up sharing the room with and how well everyone gets along, because the rooms are pretty darn big. Keep in mind that in Baker, the rooms are designed to hold 3 or 4 people, so they are pretty spacious. They even have extra furniture in them and are generally pretty cool rooms. The second notable exception is MacGregor , where all of the rooms are singles. Other than that, freshmen rooms are generally doubles. Although ocasionally a few freshmen end up with singles, and sometimes there are extra people around, which means people are forced to “crowd” a room by turning a double into a triple. (Even this is planned out pretty nicely though- the largest doubles get crowded first.) In terms of gender mixing, there is a very large spectrum in this area. Arrangements range from McCormick Hall , which is an all-girls dorm, to Senior House , where I’m pretty sure that one girl and one guy can share a double. Certain floors in Random Hall are designated as single sex, and suites in Burton-Conner can be either co-ed or single sex. For example, my suite is all girls, so we have a single-sex bathroonm, but there are other suites on my floor that are co-ed (like Sam and Mitra ‘s, for example). The point is that there are all kinds of options available, and if you make a note on your housing preference sheets and/or speak to your dorm/floor chairs, they can try to accomodate your preferences. Priya asked: “hey, What are these “reasonable restrictions” .. does the room have to b self coloured or can u paint funky pics all over the walls?? Does burton conner hav a nice view? say.. of the river??” Well, according to Jessie , the restrictions aren’t reasonable at all. (Jessie lives at East Campus, which is one of the less restrictive dorms when it comes to modifications to the rooms.) The restrictions are namely that you can only use latex paint, you can’t move certain shelving pieces, and that you can’t paint the ceiling (I admit that this one seems kind of silly- if you’ve already painted the walls, what difference does it make?) Also, if you don’t paint the room back at the end of the year, you face a maintainence fine because someone else has to dedicate a few hours of their time to repaint the room for the next year. Other than that, you can do whatever you want. My roommate and I just painted the room blue, but Sam painted a pattern in his room. You could also go crazy and paint a mural or something, if you’re artistic. Burton-Conner is located on Memorial Drive, so some of the rooms have a nice view of the river and some of the rooms have a nice view of the athletic fields. I’m lucky enough to have a river view, and this is what it looks like: My window doesn’t have a screen, so I obtained the next two pictures by actually sticking my head out there to get a better camera angle. As you can tell from the pictures I posted in my entry about painting , our beds are pushed right up against the windows. This is nice (for now, while the weather is still nice) during naptime. =) I have two friends who live in the same room 2 floors up, and the rearranged their furniture to put their desks facing the windows so they have a nice view while they’re doing work, which is also a nice idea. So that concludes today’s Q&A session. Please feel free to ask me questions, either by commenting on the blog or sending an email to the address in the banner. I’ll do my best to either answer it or send you to the person who can. As a general rule, I’ll post answers to questions in comments on the blog, but will reply directly to questions that are emailed to me. In other news, I talked to my mom on the phone the other day, and she said that she liked reading my blog but that it didn’t seem like I ever did any work. So… Coming soon – What I like about my advising seminar and 3.091.

'09 Laura N. '09 Course 2 Biography Hey! I'm Laura, and I got this job as a blogger because I'm a loudmouth Jersey girl with an attitude problem. In the early days of the blogs (before there was a blogger application process), my fellow prefrosh and I commented regularly and linked to our personal blogs. Little did we know that certain admissions officers actually READ them. When I showed up at the first ever Meet the Bloggers as a prefrosh, I introduced myself to Ben Jones, the Blogfather. He responded, \"Laura?! THE Laura? From [Laura's old personal blog title]?! I read your blog. You curse a lot and it's hilarious. You're totally blogging for us next year.\" The rest, as they say, is history. This is a great story because a) it's got a fun, crufty, back-in-the-day vibe, and b) it explains why at times I struggled mightily to keep my Attitude in check on the blogs. If I were a superhero, my superpower would be using my sarcasm to save the world from people who are too uptight about the college admissions process. You have been warned. While at MIT, I played varisty field hockey, worked at the Computing Help Desk, and organized lots of crazy events on campus, like a one-day training session certifying over 100 people in CPR and a huge cross-campus water fight. I participated in tons of activities at one point or another, so you can explore my archives for a pretty wide range of topics. I graduated from MIT in 2009 with a degree in mechanical engineering. After that I wandered through life struggling to find my purpose and blah blah blah . Eventually I got a master's degree in Public Affairs, focusing on energy policy and economics. Now I work in the energy field trying to keep the peace between the engineers and the business/sales/government people so that stuff actually gets done. I love books, physics, teaching, and quirky earrings. One of my favorite pairs is a mismatched set depicting Mars and the rover. When I get sick of the energy field, I plan to quit my job and become a real life Miss Frizzle. You can contact me at lnicks [at] alum [dot] mit [dot] edu. If you enjoyed anything on my blog, or want college/career/life/the universe/everything advice, don't be shy. I'd love to hear from you!

(Even this is planned out pretty nicely though- the largest doubles get crowded first.) In terms of gender mixing, there is a very large spectrum in this area. Arrangements range from McCormick Hall , which is an all-girls dorm, to Senior House , where I’m pretty sure that one girl and one guy can share a double. Certain floors in Random Hall are designated as single sex, and suites in Burton-Conner can be either co-ed or single sex. For example, my suite is all girls, so we have a single-sex bathroonm, but there are other suites on my floor that are co-ed (like Sam and Mitra ‘s, for example). The point is that there are all kinds of options available, and if you make a note on your housing preference sheets and/or speak to your dorm/floor chairs, they can try to accomodate your preferences. Priya asked: “hey, What are these “reasonable restrictions” .. does the room have to b self coloured or can u paint funky pics all over the walls?? Does burton conner hav a nice view? say.. of the river??” Well, according to Jessie , the restrictions aren’t reasonable at all. (Jessie lives at East Campus, which is one of the less restrictive dorms when it comes to modifications to the rooms.) The restrictions are namely that you can only use latex paint, you can’t move certain shelving pieces, and that you can’t paint the ceiling (I admit that this one seems kind of silly- if you’ve already painted the walls, what difference does it make?) Also, if you don’t paint the room back at the end of the year, you face a maintainence fine because someone else has to dedicate a few hours of their time to repaint the room for the next year. Other than that, you can do whatever you want. My roommate and I just painted the room blue, but Sam painted a pattern in his room. You could also go crazy and paint a mural or something, if you’re artistic. Burton-Conner is located on Memorial Drive, so some of the rooms have a nice view of the river and some of the rooms have a nice view of the athletic fields. I’m lucky enough to have a river view, and this is what it looks like: My window doesn’t have a screen, so I obtained the next two pictures by actually sticking my head out there to get a better camera angle. As you can tell from the pictures I posted in my entry about painting , our beds are pushed right up against the windows. This is nice (for now, while the weather is still nice) during naptime. =) I have two friends who live in the same room 2 floors up, and the rearranged their furniture to put their desks facing the windows so they have a nice view while they’re doing work, which is also a nice idea. So that concludes today’s Q&A session. Please feel free to ask me questions, either by commenting on the blog or sending an email to the address in the banner. I’ll do my best to either answer it or send you to the person who can. As a general rule, I’ll post answers to questions in comments on the blog, but will reply directly to questions that are emailed to me. In other news, I talked to my mom on the phone the other day, and she said that she liked reading my blog but that it didn’t seem like I ever did any work. So… Coming soon – What I like about my advising seminar and 3.091.

'09 That's where I live. No, seriously. October 10, 2008 in MIT Life , Residential Life So, remember how back when I blogged about all of the many varied things I might want to be when I grow up? Well, I think “interior decorator” is going to have to be added to the list, because I am seriously good at it. No, really! Okay, so unlike some people in the dorm who live in the same room forever, I have lived in a different room (and a different suite) every year so far. Not only have I painted all of these rooms, but to date, no one has painted over any of my paint jobs, so I have officially left my mark on 4 different rooms on Conner 2. Freshman year, April (my roommate) and I painted our room a very pretty blue. A few months later we bought a futon off Craigslist , squeezed it into her boyfriend’s miniCooper, and installed it in our room. (I am unfortunately not kidding about the miniCooper.) The result was a pretty awesome setup , if I may say so myself. But that was easy, doubles in BC are pretty large, and there are a lot of things you can do with them in terms of design. Sophomore year I had a pretty big single, and while I didn’t do anything special to it, I painted, bought a floor lamp, and threw up a good number of posters. I did really like the color I picked, but it turned out to be a little too dark, especially in sun-deprived New England. The name of that color, I believe, was “Bali Turquoise,” which led to a little inspiration: maybe I could get some posters of beaches and line the bottom part of the walls with them, and it would look sort of like a beach- yellow sand on the bottom and blue-green water on top. As a born and bred Jersey girl, I love the beach, so I figured this would make me happy. But the secret of room decorating is that if you don’t do it all within the first week, you’ll never do it, so the sandy posters never materialized. Junior year I picked a new room, which was actually smaller than the room I had sophomore year. Everyone thought I was crazy, because they had poked their heads into that room a few times over the past 2 years and were pretty convinced that it was a tiny, cramped, awful room. This time my beach plan was a little more defined, so I spent a good amount of time comparing colors and eventually painted the walls yellow and blue. I also learned a very important lesson of interior design, namely, furniture placement is everything. All I did in that cozy room was swap the bed and the desk, and lower the bed down to a more normal height off the floor. Everyone who walked into my room did a double take and had to recheck the number on the door. “Wait… this is the room that Rob and David lived in?! But…it’s such a nice room!” I was quite proud of myself and a few weeks later decided the next step in the beach theme would be to paint a palm tree on the wall. But, as noted above, since this didn’t happen within the first week, it never got done. Senior year I picked an even worse room than the year before. At this point everyone thought I was completely insane. As a senior, I pretty much had my pick of all the rooms on the floor, and I picked this awful, dark and awkward room. The room itself is actually pretty large, but it’s very long and narrow, which really limits the great equalizer of design which I had discovered the year before (furniture rearrangement). Also, there is one very lousy window at the end of this tunnel of a room which does not allow very much light into the room at all. So this year I was determined to get the beach theme right. Before I started to paint I had to spatcle over all of the holes in the wall, which were quite numerous and actually took a couple of days. Just to give you an idea, here are some before pictures of the room: I started painting, and unfortunately wasn’t able to finish before REX. Which meant that I spent the busiest week of my year living in a half-painted room with all of the furniture pushed into the middle, no access to the closet, and the 2 suitcases I had brought back with me from Spain shoved under the bed. It was awful. Once REX was finally over, I finished painting, and was quite proud of myself. I did sort of cop out and use the exact same colors as last year, but they were perfect! Also, credit to Adelaide ’09 for the diagonal idea. I decided that painting the bottom half of the walls one color would be pretty silly, because it would almost entirely be covered by furniture, and defeat the purpose of the half-and-half idea. As you can see, light really is a problem in this room…but now it was time to start on that palm tree that I swore up and down to paint eventually. I did a trial run on a large sheet of paper, and came up with this sad excuse for a palm tree: Well, I wasn’t convinced that I could do much better than that, so I just dove right in and started penciling it on the wall, making adjustments as I went. I was really and truly skeptical of my ability to paint anything that remotely resembled a palm tree, but my second attempt was pretty respectable. And once I started mixing paint colors, things really started to come together. The final product actually kind of ROCKS. I’m super proud. =) The next task was to build a loft. This idea came to me in a flash of brilliance, as we were discussing with the new freshmen if they wanted to loft their beds for more space in their doubles. I suddenly had the realization that I had seem this awfully shaped room of mine in both possible furniture configurations, and they both sucked- so why not loft the bed? I had nothing to lose, and it just might be the touch I needed. Of course, if I was going to loft the bed I needed something to put under it. Craigslist came through for me again- so I rented a UHaul, made an adventurous trip to Home Depot to buy lumber for no fewer than 4 lofts, an picked up a futon all in one day. At this point I was getting pretty discouraged. If you’re keeping track at home, remember I spent a full week with the room half painted and all of the furniture shoved into the middle, another 2 or 3 days to finish painting, another day running around buying materials, and was still living out of one suitcase and had basically unpacked nothing despite having been back on campus for over 2 weeks. Adelaide’s room was so nice and prettily painted, and she had arranged all of her books on her shelves, and every time I peeked in her room I felt so jealous. And I still had to build a loft. Rick ’09 graciously offered to lend me a hand. Halfway through the construction of this loft, the dorm’s saw mysteriously disappeared, so I was stuck with a box on stitls and no way to actually stabilize it, and was going to have to spend another night sleeping on the floor. I thought I was going to cry. But luckily, we found someone in the dorm who had their own saw and was willing to lend it to me. Throughout this whole process, I had basically tried the furniture in every possible configuration I could think of, including the really stupid ones. So by the time the loft was done being built, I had figured out the configuration of the room, and the end was in sight! Thankfully, now all that was left was unpacking…and picking up a few more minor touches to fill out the beach theme, like a bamboo bead curtain for my door, a sunset poster for one wall, and a comfy chair for my reading corner…and finally, I was done! A few days later I ran into the room’s previous occupant, Javi ’08, on campus. Javi graduated last year but stuck around and got a job in the Boston area, so we still see him from time to time. I was bouncing around in excitement about the success of my room, so I dragged him back to the dorm to show him my take on the space that he lived in for 3 years. He walked in and said, “No. No. This isn’t my room. My room isn’t this nice. Where did all this space come from?! I want it back!” And just to refresh your memory as to how far I came… I win. =) In case that international development thing doesn’t work out, I can always fall back on interior design. Or at least Trading Spaces.

We also coordinate the Educational Council, an international network of over 3,500 alumni who serve as local ambassadors and conduct interviews , and host more than 45,000 visitors a year who attend our information sessions and campus tours . MIT Admissions was established in 1929, and is currently led by Stu Schmill ’86 , Dean of Admissions and Student Financial Services. Our team of admissions officers , support staff, admissions bloggers , tour guides, and student workers take pride in the mission, vision, tradition , and integrity of our work on behalf of the Institute and those who aspire to attend it. As one of our colleagues once wrote, we believe that working at MIT Admissions is more than a job : i t is a privilege, an honor, and a responsibility, and requires a public and institutional trust that we do not take for granted and work very hard to keep. Our Mission The MIT Office of Undergraduate Admissions enrolls a talented and diverse undergraduate student body composed of some of the world’s most intelligent and creative individuals interested in an education centered on science and technology. The students we enroll add to a vibrant campus community and will become the leaders and innovators of our global society. We uphold a commitment to meritocracy and fair access to our admissions process for students from all backgrounds. Our Principles In pursuing our mission, and realizing our vision, we are guided by several principles that help us do the right thing by our applicants and our institution. We are egalitarian For us, egalitarian means that we evaluate all students on equal terms, and on the basis of their own individual interests and aptitudes as opposed to their resources or connections. All admitted students pass through the same demanding process ⁠ 02 Before any applicant is accepted, that person’s application passes through at least five distinct stages of review and is evaluated by several different committees composed of admissions officers and faculty reviewers. This <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/selection/\">process</a>, which is unique in its particular design and has held fast for more than 50 years, guards against an individual’s biases, preferences, or familiarity with a given applicant swaying a decision unfairly. and meet the same demanding standard, regardless of legacy status , donor affiliation, or athletic recruitment. We have no quotas by school, state, region, or socioeconomic background, but we also value diversity and believe that it contributes to the merit of each class. We are fortunate to be able to consider all applicants without regard for their ability to pay for the MIT education, and meet their full financial need with our generous aid . We acknowledge that there are many ways to define the “the best” students , and that it’s very difficult to disentangle privilege from opportunity and act not only equally but equitably on every applicant.  However, we do the best we possibly can to consider each student’s achievements and potential relative to their context , and to allocate scarce seats in the class where they will have the highest impact: for the student, for the Institute, and for the world. We are accessible For us, accessible means that anyone should be able to understand how to apply to MIT, be able to complete an application, ⁠ 03 For example, we routinely <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/for-those-impacted-by-hurricane-michael-and-other-disasters/\">extend deadlines on account of disasters</a>, and routinely <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/application-fee-fee-waiver/\">waive fees</a> if they might present any hardship. and, if admitted, be able to afford to attend. ⁠ 04 Our <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/afford/cost-aid-basics/\">full-need financial aid</a> meets 100% of all students’ demonstrated financial need. We are committed to making MIT financially accessible. To do this, describe our admissions process, in print and online, in as comprehensive and comprehensible a manner as we can. ⁠ 05 Including annotations where necessary. We are as transparent about our work as possible: we tell you what we are looking for , publish admissions statistics , and avoid any unnecessary complexities or hidden preferences ⁠ 06 For example, we don't care if you apply Early or Regular, we don't consider demonstrated interest, we're need-blind, and so on. that could give some applicants an unfair advantage through access to ‘insider’ knowledge. We also believe in truth-in-advertising and try to present MIT accurately : good, bad, and otherwise. When we travel, we try to recruit from the broadest possible public, and our Educational Council offers interviews to as many students as it can to help demystify MIT. We are easy to contact, and try to respond to all 70,000+ emails we receive per year as quickly and personally as we can. We acknowledge that that there is an ironic tension between our goal of being accessible and the reality that the vast majority of our applicants will not be offered admission. However, we believe that our work to demystify both MIT and the admissions process, as well as our commitment to a level playing field, contributes to the well-being of our applicants, their families, and the broader ‘system’ in which we collectively have a stake. We are responsible For us, being responsible means acknowledging that we have a moral obligation to act ethically, on behalf of our institution and the public we serve . To that end, we routinely reconsider, and reflect upon, our programs and processes to ask ourselves if they are student-centered, institutionally aligned, and in the public interest . We understand that our actions and expectations influence the behavior of students, parents, and others with a stake in our work, and try to support initiatives and affirm principles that we hope will positively influence the conversation around college admissions. We encourage students to be their best selves rather than conform to what they imagine might get them into MIT, and we try to remind them that their application is not the end, but the beginning, of a set of choices that will cumulatively determine their life.

Diversity statement Statement on the role of diversity in MIT Admissions In undergraduate recruitment and selection, MIT looks at each application holistically, taking account of many different factors that have shaped a student’s experience. We believe it is crucial for the successful future of our world to educate people from every walk of life. Statement on the role of diversity in MIT’s educational mission Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid ( CUAFA ), October 2015 A diverse student body is and has long been critical to the educational mission of MIT. We are committed to providing our students “with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community.” Our goal in forming the student body might simply be to select students who are, individually, excellent. Indeed, this is essential to our practice: every student we admit has demonstrated academic and personal excellence that placed them at the top of our applicant pool. But we strive for more than just individual excellence. Because our students learn so much from one another, our goal is to form a student body that is, collectively, excellent: an excellent group of excellent students, who will surprise, challenge, and support one another. Our educational approach, reflected in the MIT motto Mens et Manus, engages students directly in the process of innovation—hands-on work, often carried out in groups, that requires creativity as well as camaraderie. Our students’ success depends on their exposure to many viewpoints and their ability to trust peers to provide both support and criticism. Moreover, the experience of working with a diverse set of peers at MIT prepares our students to work effectively in the world outside MIT: it opens their minds and attunes them both to the variety of strengths and the variety of concerns of others. Diversity of viewpoints is derived from a diversity of backgrounds and experiences along many dimensions, among which are gender, race, ethnicity, culture, and socio-economic background. How much diversity is necessary to achieve our goals? Every student should feel that “there are people like me here” and “there are people different from me here.” No student should feel isolated; all students should come into contact with members of other groups and experience them as colleagues with valuable ideas and insights. It is through this experience of the richness and diversity of interests, strengths, viewpoints, and concerns of their fellow students that our students become open-minded intellectuals and innovators, primed to pursue the MIT mission of the betterment of humankind. Nondiscrimination policy The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in education and employment. The Institute prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ⁠ 01 The ROTC programs at MIT are operated under Department of Defense (DoD) policies and regulations, and do not comply fully with MIT’s policy of nondiscrimination with regard to gender identity. MIT continues to advocate for a change in DoD policies and regulations concerning gender identity, and is committed to providing alternative financial assistance under a needs-based assessment to any MIT student who loses ROTC financial aid because of these DoD policies and regulations. pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, employment policies, scholarship and loan programs, and other Institute administered programs and activities; the Institute may, however, favor U.S. citizens or residents in admissions and financial aid. The Vice President for Human Resources is designated as the Institute’s Equal Opportunity Officer.

About our office The MIT Office of Undergraduate Admissions ⁠ 02 MIT Admissions for short. oversees the recruitment and selection of all undergraduate applicants to the Institute, including both prospective first-year and transfer students. You can read more about our office here and view a current directory here . The office is broadly organized into a few different teams. Each is chiefly responsible for leading some important area of our work, but we all work across teams to make that happen. In alphabetical order, they include: Campus Visits: welcomes more than 45,000 visitors to campus annually and provides friendly, helpful support to those with questions via email and phones Communications: oversees how we make MIT (and our admissions process) intelligible to a vast and varied audience, while retaining both factual accuracy and deep cultural resonance Educational Council: coordinates our international network of more than 5,000 alumni who serve as local ambassadors and conduct interviews Targeted Recruitment: designs and leads the programs and initiatives that help us recruit, select, and enroll a diverse student body , supported by the entire office Operations: develops and deploys the technical systems and analytical capabilities for the entire office to do its work Outreach: plans and produces on-campus (e.g. Campus Preview Weekend), off-campus (e.g. fall recruitment travel), and virtual events Research & Analysis: continuously studies our own processes and outcomes so that we can equitably enroll a diverse and talented student body that succeeds at MIT and in the world after Selection: designs and oversees the application process for both first-year and transfer students, helping to develop policy and processes that are in the best interest of applicants to MIT Some members of the staff are admissions officers (AOs) , who do recruitment travel, give information sessions, read applications, and select students in committee. Others do not have any admissions travel, reading, or committee responsibilities, but work alongside AOs to meet the needs of their teams. Whether or not they are admissions officers, everyone in our office is motivated by our incredible students and vibrant community. We also are deeply invested in the professional development of each person on the team. ⁠ 03 We have a specific leadership position dedicated to helping staff identify opportunities for themselves to learn and grow. The office encourages and supports professional development by e.g. funding the fees and travel for conferences, helping staff plan for continuing education, and looking for opportunities to collaborate across teams in the office to build cross-functional skills. While we work hard to retain our staff, we are also proud of the MIT Admissions employee alumni network, which spans not only traditional paths in higher ed or college counseling, but also doctoral programs, entrepreneurship, nonprofit leadership, and more. We are often asked by interested people outside the profession: “what makes a good MIT admissions officer”? ⁠ 04 Since every admissions office is different — with different priorities, serving different institutions, with different visions — what we say in this section and on most of the page applies primarily to MIT. There are many answers, but in general, they include: The ability to read and write quickly, accurately, and well, with keen attention to detail, and the ability to discern pattern from chaos The capacity to rapidly form a well-supported opinion, and just as rapidly defer to the collective judgment of the committee when situationally appropriate The adaptability to succeed in multiple professional contexts: reading at home alone, discussing cases in committee, and traveling to speak publicly before large audiences The discretion and tact to discuss deeply sensitive matters, and the integrity to be entrusted with extremely important decisions The initiative to work independently with minimal supervision over sustained periods Certain roles in the office require specific skills, but these are the underlying attributes common to people who tend to enjoy, and do well in, the admissions profession. Beyond the pay and benefits , most of us find deep meaning in the people we serve as stewards of the Institute. Working at MIT means working among some of the most creative, brilliant, thoughtful people in the world. While most of us aren’t alumni of the Institute, many of us have developed deep connections with the community through our own cultural match with MIT .

Esperamos que esta página ayuda a cada persona que quiera aprender más sobre nuestra comunidad dinámica, diversa, y compasiva. Aquí encontrarás información de la historia del Instituto, nuestro programa académico, y nuestro generoso programa de asistencia financiera. Historia de MIT Aunque han pasado más de 160 años de su constitución, el objetivo de MIT continúa siendo el mismo: “ampliar el conocimiento y educar a los alumnos en ciencias, tecnología y otras áreas educativas que sirvan a la nación y al mundo en el siglo XXI mediante la generación, la difusión y la preservación del conocimiento, [y] el trabajo con otros para que este conocimiento pueda aplicarse a los retos más grandes que existen en el mundo.” Las comunidades de MIT MIT es conocido por su comunidad innovadora de estudiantes, investigadores, y creadores que utilizan sus habilidades para mejorar el mundo. Creemos que es crucial educar a personas de todos los ámbitos de la vida para proporcionar soluciones que beneficien a todas las comunidades. Eso es evidente a través de nuestra extraordinaria diversidad. No existe un origen étnico mayoritario. Los ciudadanos extranjeros representan el 11% de los alumnos de MIT. Tenemos alumnos de los 50 estados y 135 países extranjeros. El 66% de los alumnos del primer año asistió a escuelas secundarias públicas y aproximadamente el 18% representa la primera generación en sus familias en ir a la universidad. Programa académico en MIT Cuerpo docente de excelencia En nuestra humilde opinión, este es el mejor lugar para estudiar. Somos una universidad dedicada a la investigación que concede gran importancia a la educación de pregrado. Entre otros eruditos, podemos destacar a algunos profesores laureados : 24 ganadores de las becas MacArthur Genius Grant, 11 galardonados con el Premio Nobel, y un ganador del Premio Pulitzer, que actualmente integran nuestro cuerpo docente. Y todos ellos dictan clases a los alumnos de pregrado. De hecho, todas las clases de MIT son dictadas por distinguidos profesores porque creemos que los alumnos deben aprender de los mejores desde el primer momento que pisan el campus. Colaboración de los alumnos MIT además cree profundamente en la colaboración de los alumnos. Se espera que los alumnos trabajen en equipo para resolver las tareas, o lo que denominamos “ psets .” Implementamos esta modalidad porque es la forma en que se resuelven los problemas en el mundo real: en grupos reducidos de personas inteligentes que contribuyen con su experiencia y comprensión personales. Cuando su hijo se gradúe en MIT y comience a trabajar en una empresa Fortune 500, en una organización sin fines de lucro, o como empresario y deba dar un argumento de venta, necesitará saber cómo trabajar en equipo. Investigación en MIT Los alumnos de MIT cuentan con oportunidades inigualables para participar en las investigaciones más vanguardistas aun siendo estudiantes de pregrado. Programa de oportunidades de investigación para alumnos de pregrado El programa emblemático de investigación para alumnos de MIT es el Programa de oportunidades de investigación para alumnos de pregrado ( UROP ). A fin de encontrar un UROP, el alumno debe primero encontrar un profesor que esté trabajando en algo que le interese. Ambos trabajarán en una propuesta y luego el alumno podrá unirse al equipo. El 94% de los alumnos de MIT participará en el UROP. Muchos de ellos serán reconocidos como coautores en publicaciones revisadas por colegas. Algunos incluso obtienen patentes . Una parte fundamental de lo que nuestro cuerpo docente enseña, siguiendo el ejemplo de sus propias vidas, es el “instinto” para la investigación de primer nivel: la curiosidad disciplinada, la creatividad irreverente, la eterna capacidad de perseverar. Los laboratorios de investigación en donde el alumno puede desarrollar un UROP incluyen: Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research : recibió 100 millones de dólares del Instituto Nacional del Cáncer. D-Lab : desarrolla tecnologías sostenibles y soluciones para problemas en los países en desarrollo. MIT Game Lab : un laboratorio internacional dedicado al desarrollo y el diseño de videojuegos. El reactor nuclear de MIT : realiza investigaciones interdisciplinarias y avanzadas sobre las ciencias de los materiales y la terapia por radiación. Además de cientos de otros laboratorios en el campus. Asistencia financiera Si logras ingresar a MIT, nos aseguraremos de que puedas costear tu estadía en MIT.

'24 not to mention meet the bloggers April 25, 2024 in Community Projects , CPW , Extracurriculars , Residential Life CPW was so much fun! I meant to get this blog up and running beforehand, but I was too busy prepping for all the events I lead or helped with! Here’s how they went. Contour My team and I held several events to show adMITs the software-free laser cutter, called Contour, that we built last semester in 2.009. ⁠ 01 a product development capstone class After 2.009, nine of us continued working on the project. We’re called Contour now, not Pink Team, and we’re still figuring out how much of our name to capitalize. We’re digging into market research, learning the ins and outs of team formation, and testing our product with potential users. We held several events to show adMITs our laser cutter, teach them how to use it, and generate hype for MechE. When I entered MIT, I had no idea I’d get as invested in building things as I currently am — I wanted to inspire frosh to see what they can build after a few years at MIT! I’ve become one of two co-leads on Contour, and I spearheaded the organization and logistics for our three events. The team all worked hard to make this happen — UX prepared posters, stickers, and keychains, Software did several overhauls on the code to make it more robust, and the other co-lead helped run and prep for events. I love working with this team; every time we have a deadline, I feel at once that my work is needed to get it done, and that I can depend on everyone to push until the work is done. look at him. he’s so beautiful The day of the last and biggest event, “Discover Making and MechE with CONTOUR,” we had an especially ambitious goal: we wanted to have adMITs cut whatever they wanted on the laser cutter. We’ve tested with a few outside people, but never a crowd of creative teenagers, and we were curious to see what people would come up with and how they would respond to our constraints. We set up our wood and paper, keychains and stickers and candy in the MechE Lounge, expecting about twenty people to stop by over the next two hours. Instead, there were about seventy. AdMITs who were all much taller than me filled the MechE Lounge, so much that getting from one side to the other felt like moving through a crowded dance floor. Their bodies blocked the light from the laser cutter; their voices covered the hum of the motors. People poured out of the MechE Lounge and filled the hallway. This was glorious and terrifying. I warned the back half of the line that the wait would be long. Contour takes about three minutes to cut out a small shape, so realistically we only had time for about 40 people to cut out their drawings. And that didn’t account for drawings that weren’t designed for laser cutters, or times the CV ⁠ 02 computer vision software messed up. And sometimes the software messed up. We spent the first hour and a half with a sub-optimal set-up that led to a number of errors. After we switched things around, we could catch most errors early on, and cutting out shapes went a lot more smoothly. Once we got Contour on a roll, it worked so well! I loved watching the machine we’d built cut out so many designs. viking boat dragon I drew By the time the event was over, there were still 24 hopeful adMITs. Some were holding multiple sheets of paper for their friends. Almost all of the team had to leave. There was just one person on Software left, and me. But we felt bad sending the adMITs away, when they’d waited so long. We kept cutting out projects for a half hour or so. Then my teammate had class, leaving me alone with the machine and small handful of remaining adMITs. I took over and kept cutting their projects. I was impressed by how creative everyone was. Some students were clearly artists, and beautiful, complicated shapes came easily to them. Others had no art background at all, and came up with creative ways to design interesting shapes. There were a lot of beavers and Wide Tims traced from phone screens. I finished cutting adMIT projects about thirty minutes after the event ended. Then I cut my own viking ship. Finally I cleaned up (another team member skipped a meeting to help me cart all of our supplies back), and began to rush to another meeting, thinking how I’d barely have time to grab food on the way… when I found a bench with five trays of Anna’s Taqueria. I grinned. The free food gods were rewarding me for my labors. I loved the adMITs’ energy. They asked good questions about MechE and the workload at MIT, and I felt that as a senior, I was able to answer those better than I had been before. My answers weren’t universal — but I tried to keep them unbiased, to be clear about what biases I might have, and to emphasize the many paths different students take. I was left with a lot of insight and a lot of questions about where to take Contour from here. Meet the Bloggers I’ll be at our very own Meet the Bloggers, where we wear shirts with our faces on them, eat pie, and meet adMITs. The blogs have been such a wonderful thing to be part of these last four years. The bloggers were one of my first communities at MIT, during the covid year, and they were one of my strongest connections to the Institute when everything was shut down. Writing blogs taught me to tell stories about myself, to capture pieces of the real world and preserve them, which is different from writing reflections of the world in fiction. This skill has been so useful in blogging, poetry, and monologues. I talked with Jeremy about careers and PhDs. As I grow older, Jeremy and other staff have become the people in the blogger community I know best. I felt a bit older, a bit less entertained by whatever quirky thing I’d done – though interesting to imagine all the different ambers there could have been. Some people have an inevitability to them, if they went to [redacted] university they’d be much the same. But you – who would you be in Tucson? Who would you be in art school? I didn’t have the words for it then but I do imagine those women – me in Tucson who might have learned to go to frat parties but wouldn’t have found spaces like B1, a group of majority queer, majority women who become the life of any dance floor. In Tucson she wouldn’t really emerge from being more of a nerd than most people around her. I thought of myself in art school, ⁠ 03 by this I mean literally any school that isn't MIT, where I would spend more time and effort on my creative writing degree; not 'art school' per se but my experience of it would encompass more art my art getting better; maybe I’d be published by now. I’d be terrified for my career after the rise of AI. I don’t know who exactly I’d be. But in the meeting room I thought, I like the MIT version best. bloggers, met ASA Midway Walking through Midway and talking to pre-frosh for a club was warm and bittersweet. I hadn’t been in that space since my own CPW in 2019, and again during sophomore REX. This time I knew so many people! Some of my friends have exec roles on AAI ⁠ 04 Asian American Initiative and BSU ⁠ 05 Black Students' Union , and I learned that some of my teammates from MechE projects are also on Casino Rueda ⁠ 06 Cuban salsa team and Divest, ⁠ 07 Environmental action club and friends I knew from classes are apparently in BioMakerspace and Mocha. ⁠ 08 hip-hop dance team The list goes on, but you get the idea. I love the interconnectedness of MIT, how many passions people pour their time into. There was also a sort of nostalgia to passing by clubs I find compelling but never had the bandwidth to join. I wondered how my dancing or singing abilities might have improved with three years of dedicated practice. I’ll have more time to learn new skills after MIT, but finding spaces to learn with will be much more difficult. Mujeres Latinas and LUCHA also stood out to me; I’ve signed up for their mailing lists at various times, but never really went to meetings. I’ve found Latinx culture in my dorm communities and friendships instead. I know I can only be deeply invested in so many communities, and that I didn’t have the bandwidth for clubs until senior spring — but that may be different next year, and I looked up Hispanic graduate school clubs that evening. Burton One B1athalon! The B1ners ⁠ 09 B1ner = boner = person who lives on Burton One. Pronounced 'boner.' B-one-r, get it? turned the Burton One hallway into an obstacle course and sent adMITs leaping over chairs, ducking under tables, and shooting nerf guns into a target. Sofia and Jonathan directed the set-up and running of the event. They’re both underclassmen, and it was awesome to see them take charge and know that the floor will keep going strong after the seniors are gone. We ran the B1athalon on Thursday and Saturday night. On Saturday, some adMITs mentioned wanting to go to a party, so we started a party in the flounge. ⁠ 10 B1 floor lounge Music blasted down the hallway right outside. I hung out in a nearby suite with Selena ’24, a fellow B1ner, and about 10 adMITs. Some adMITs had questions about life in the dorms: was it loud? How long did parties go for? If you’re not on the meal plan, Other adMITs were all worn out of questions and were simply drinking in the vibes, making conversation, or planning their next move. Some were trying to find pancakes; others wanted to make a karaoke event. Other B1ners came and we discussed life, the universe, and everything. When I went to sleep around 2 or 3 am, some of the adMITs were still talking with each other, sitting on the rug in our flounge. Some were choosing between MIT and another college; others were committed. Some of them may never be in that room again, and maybe some will end their weekend nights on that rug for years to come. b1ner pancakes from a different b1 event, bab1o b1casso :D a product development capstone class ⁠ back to text ↑ computer vision ⁠ back to text ↑ by this I mean literally any school that isn't MIT, where I would spend more time and effort on my creative writing degree; not 'art school' per se but my experience of it would encompass more art ⁠ back to text ↑ Asian American Initiative ⁠ back to text ↑ Black Students' Union ⁠ back to text ↑ Cuban salsa team ⁠ back to text ↑ Environmental action club ⁠ back to text ↑ hip-hop dance team ⁠ back to text ↑ B1ner = boner = person who lives on Burton One.

'24 Amber V. '24 Courses 2A & 21 [email protected] Biography My mom named me Amber after the stop codon in DNA. I come from Tucson, Arizona, where cacti take the place of trees, and your feet blister on the pavement. Because of this I like green plants, rivers that flow all year round, and the sky before it rains. Some things about me -- I went on a gap year with a huge backpack in Europe. Some of that year was spent at a writing retreat with a goat called Buttercup, where I milked about 2 quarts each day, which adds up to a lot of milk. I like chemistry and physics, black coffee and Mexican fast food. I get excited about history and how Italian coffeemakers work, old art, cafes, the Killers, musicals, math, being in new places, and, for some reason, the French Revolution. I accumulate stacks of books I will never read, though I will always intend to. I run. Also, I write. Fantasy novels, mostly, though I like short stories too. I want to be a writer, and every writer needs a day job, and a slew of odd experiences to draw from. I think MIT will help with those. Let's see how this adventure unfolds.

Contour takes about three minutes to cut out a small shape, so realistically we only had time for about 40 people to cut out their drawings. And that didn’t account for drawings that weren’t designed for laser cutters, or times the CV ⁠ 02 computer vision software messed up. And sometimes the software messed up. We spent the first hour and a half with a sub-optimal set-up that led to a number of errors. After we switched things around, we could catch most errors early on, and cutting out shapes went a lot more smoothly. Once we got Contour on a roll, it worked so well! I loved watching the machine we’d built cut out so many designs. viking boat dragon I drew By the time the event was over, there were still 24 hopeful adMITs. Some were holding multiple sheets of paper for their friends. Almost all of the team had to leave. There was just one person on Software left, and me. But we felt bad sending the adMITs away, when they’d waited so long. We kept cutting out projects for a half hour or so. Then my teammate had class, leaving me alone with the machine and small handful of remaining adMITs. I took over and kept cutting their projects. I was impressed by how creative everyone was. Some students were clearly artists, and beautiful, complicated shapes came easily to them. Others had no art background at all, and came up with creative ways to design interesting shapes. There were a lot of beavers and Wide Tims traced from phone screens. I finished cutting adMIT projects about thirty minutes after the event ended. Then I cut my own viking ship. Finally I cleaned up (another team member skipped a meeting to help me cart all of our supplies back), and began to rush to another meeting, thinking how I’d barely have time to grab food on the way… when I found a bench with five trays of Anna’s Taqueria. I grinned. The free food gods were rewarding me for my labors. I loved the adMITs’ energy. They asked good questions about MechE and the workload at MIT, and I felt that as a senior, I was able to answer those better than I had been before. My answers weren’t universal — but I tried to keep them unbiased, to be clear about what biases I might have, and to emphasize the many paths different students take. I was left with a lot of insight and a lot of questions about where to take Contour from here. Meet the Bloggers I’ll be at our very own Meet the Bloggers, where we wear shirts with our faces on them, eat pie, and meet adMITs. The blogs have been such a wonderful thing to be part of these last four years. The bloggers were one of my first communities at MIT, during the covid year, and they were one of my strongest connections to the Institute when everything was shut down. Writing blogs taught me to tell stories about myself, to capture pieces of the real world and preserve them, which is different from writing reflections of the world in fiction. This skill has been so useful in blogging, poetry, and monologues. I talked with Jeremy about careers and PhDs. As I grow older, Jeremy and other staff have become the people in the blogger community I know best. I felt a bit older, a bit less entertained by whatever quirky thing I’d done – though interesting to imagine all the different ambers there could have been. Some people have an inevitability to them, if they went to [redacted] university they’d be much the same. But you – who would you be in Tucson? Who would you be in art school? I didn’t have the words for it then but I do imagine those women – me in Tucson who might have learned to go to frat parties but wouldn’t have found spaces like B1, a group of majority queer, majority women who become the life of any dance floor. In Tucson she wouldn’t really emerge from being more of a nerd than most people around her. I thought of myself in art school, ⁠ 03 by this I mean literally any school that isn't MIT, where I would spend more time and effort on my creative writing degree; not 'art school' per se but my experience of it would encompass more art my art getting better; maybe I’d be published by now. I’d be terrified for my career after the rise of AI. I don’t know who exactly I’d be. But in the meeting room I thought, I like the MIT version best. bloggers, met ASA Midway Walking through Midway and talking to pre-frosh for a club was warm and bittersweet. I hadn’t been in that space since my own CPW in 2019, and again during sophomore REX. This time I knew so many people! Some of my friends have exec roles on AAI ⁠ 04 Asian American Initiative and BSU ⁠ 05 Black Students' Union , and I learned that some of my teammates from MechE projects are also on Casino Rueda ⁠ 06 Cuban salsa team and Divest, ⁠ 07 Environmental action club and friends I knew from classes are apparently in BioMakerspace and Mocha. ⁠ 08 hip-hop dance team The list goes on, but you get the idea. I love the interconnectedness of MIT, how many passions people pour their time into. There was also a sort of nostalgia to passing by clubs I find compelling but never had the bandwidth to join. I wondered how my dancing or singing abilities might have improved with three years of dedicated practice. I’ll have more time to learn new skills after MIT, but finding spaces to learn with will be much more difficult. Mujeres Latinas and LUCHA also stood out to me; I’ve signed up for their mailing lists at various times, but never really went to meetings. I’ve found Latinx culture in my dorm communities and friendships instead. I know I can only be deeply invested in so many communities, and that I didn’t have the bandwidth for clubs until senior spring — but that may be different next year, and I looked up Hispanic graduate school clubs that evening. Burton One B1athalon! The B1ners ⁠ 09 B1ner = boner = person who lives on Burton One. Pronounced 'boner.' B-one-r, get it? turned the Burton One hallway into an obstacle course and sent adMITs leaping over chairs, ducking under tables, and shooting nerf guns into a target. Sofia and Jonathan directed the set-up and running of the event. They’re both underclassmen, and it was awesome to see them take charge and know that the floor will keep going strong after the seniors are gone. We ran the B1athalon on Thursday and Saturday night. On Saturday, some adMITs mentioned wanting to go to a party, so we started a party in the flounge. ⁠ 10 B1 floor lounge Music blasted down the hallway right outside. I hung out in a nearby suite with Selena ’24, a fellow B1ner, and about 10 adMITs. Some adMITs had questions about life in the dorms: was it loud? How long did parties go for? If you’re not on the meal plan, Other adMITs were all worn out of questions and were simply drinking in the vibes, making conversation, or planning their next move. Some were trying to find pancakes; others wanted to make a karaoke event. Other B1ners came and we discussed life, the universe, and everything. When I went to sleep around 2 or 3 am, some of the adMITs were still talking with each other, sitting on the rug in our flounge. Some were choosing between MIT and another college; others were committed. Some of them may never be in that room again, and maybe some will end their weekend nights on that rug for years to come. b1ner pancakes from a different b1 event, bab1o b1casso :D a product development capstone class ⁠ back to text ↑ computer vision ⁠ back to text ↑ by this I mean literally any school that isn't MIT, where I would spend more time and effort on my creative writing degree; not 'art school' per se but my experience of it would encompass more art ⁠ back to text ↑ Asian American Initiative ⁠ back to text ↑ Black Students' Union ⁠ back to text ↑ Cuban salsa team ⁠ back to text ↑ Environmental action club ⁠ back to text ↑ hip-hop dance team ⁠ back to text ↑ B1ner = boner = person who lives on Burton One.

'25 math month post April 24, 2024 in Classes , Majors & Minors I asked a bunch of people, professors, current and former students why they do math and their thoughts on the MIT math department. Here is what they had to say! Short introductions! Jonathan: My name is Jonathan. I joined the department as a postdoc last year. I’m interested in topology, which is the study of flexible shapes like knots or rubber surfaces. We can’t use the traditional geometrical measurements like length or area to characterize these shapes since they aren’t rigid. So we develop more robust measurements like counting the number of holes in the shape. 01 Fatima: I took Seminar in Topology last semester with Jonathan! (let’s call them) Z: I’m a recent MIT alum who majored in 18, and now in a math PhD program. Carl S. ’23: I’m Carl, and I’m a first-year math PhD student at Stanford. My main interest is extremal combinatorics, but I’m also interested in analytic number theory (and maybe some other analytic things). Tristan S. ’23: I’m a 2023 graduate of the math and music majors, currently a master’s student at the University of Cambridge. Matthew H. ’25: Hi! I’m Matthew, a ‘25 who lives in Next House. I’m a former Californian who enjoys playing tennis, chess-related activities, and watching local sports teams. Misheel O. ’25: I’m a junior at MIT studying math and CS, and I watch anime and stuff. ⁠ 02 know an xkcd for every situation Zimi Z. ’25: I am a third-year student in course 18C (Math with Computer Science). As the name of my major suggests, I do a lot of things involving math and computer science and both. Why do you do math? Professor Cohn ⁠ 03 Fatima: I took Algebra I with Professor Cohn last fall! : One of the things I love about math is that we’re all on the same team. Of course I’m not the world’s greatest mathematician: I’ve done some interesting mathematics, but there are others who are more accomplished. If math were a competition to be the best, I might as well give up now, because I have no hope of “winning math” (whatever that might mean). Fortunately, that’s just not how it works. If someone else proves an amazing theorem, their achievement doesn’t make my work any less interesting or significant. Instead, the more we learn, the more fascinating and valuable mathematics as a whole becomes. We’re all working together to figure out the answers to questions we share an interest in. As in all human activities, there’s occasionally competition for jobs or prizes, but competition is not the point of mathematics. Other mathematicians are my friends and colleagues, not my rivals. The reason I want to emphasize this is because of how incredibly successful MIT students have been in the Putnam exam (see here ). There are many amazingly quick and insightful students at MIT, and I think people sometimes get the impression that success as a math major must mean being able to come up with ingenious solutions to carefully posed problems under time pressure. That’s an impressive skill, but it’s not the most important skill a mathematician can have, or necessary for success. It’s important to celebrate achievements in math competitions without letting them overshadow other forms of promise or achievement. 04 Fatima: This answers a bunch of the questions that follow, but I didn't want to break it up because so true!! Jonathan: I enjoy the mystery of it. You’ll often see some patterns that you can’t explain, but after working hard to understand the objects better, the patterns become natural and inevitable. Z: I’ve been interested in math for basically my whole life, initially through math competitions but now for the math itself, which I find both interesting and beautiful. Carl: I’ve pretty much always been more interested in math than anything else. This has maintained since I was about four years old, despite the fact that what “math” means has changed a lot — from arithmetic to short-answer questions to olympiads to college classes and now to research. I’ve essentially followed the “path of most math” for most of my life up to this point: I considered studying CS or physics in college, but liked math more; I explored quantitative finance and software development, but preferred research math. I’m pretty happy with where this path has brought me, and there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing. Matthew: I like the combination of intuition and rigor–I believe the former is more important to me, but I think being able to understand concepts from the ground up is satisfying. I also think that understanding the explanations of various phenomena through math is something that I value, which is why I take a lot of classes in subjects that aren’t math, but involve math to a reasonably high degree (for example: I took Systems Biology, where a large focus of the class was understanding how systems of molecules that regulate each other behave, which can be modeled using dynamical systems.) Misheel: I like doing math because I like the idea of figuring things out and/or understanding things. It’s really hard to say really general stuff, but if you assume a small number of reasonable things (axioms), then suddenly those concepts connect together and you get an explosion of connections and new concepts that you can learn and explore. I also play a lot of video games (or used to before college lol) so I like making video game analogies. In this case, the axioms are sort of like a seed for a world in minecraft and you explore what grows out of that seed and do cool stuff. Another analogy is that research in general feels like exploration as well, like exploring every corner of a room before moving on, and I enjoy that a lot. Running a dfs ⁠ 05 depth first search in some sense. ⁠ 06 Misheel: it is important to contrast the need for dfs in research with the danger of dfs in learning because if you dfs in learning, you really can't stop and you'll have very specific knowledge about a few fields but not a lot of foundation. so for studying bfs (breadth first search) is better or something. Zimi: Good question, I don’t know if I would call myself someone who “does math” as I have not engaged too much in math besides taking classes. I take these classes mostly because they are fun! I have not participated in a math UROP or DRP, ⁠ 07 directed reading program. during IAP, math majors can sign up to read some math topic of their choice with a mentor. which is honestly something I regret a little. What do you think is one of the hardest things to get right in math pedagogy? 08 Fatima: For some reason, I did not send this question to any of the students. I regret that! People probably had thoughts from the other side and a lot of students also TA classes anyway. Jonathan: Math is very interconnected, and the best way to learn a subject is to get acquainted with examples and intuition from neighbouring areas. So it’s difficult to teach math in a linear way! I wish I could continue my classes with students after a couple semesters, and circle back to old material with new context from other subjects they’ve learned. What are your thoughts on the math department at MIT? Jonathan: It’s really nice being surrounded by people (students and faculty alike) excited about math and working on such interesting problems! Z: The MIT math department (including both pure and applied) is one of the best in the world, and in particular the undergrad math population has been insanely strong the past few years (see Putnam results…). It’s also worth mentioning that the standard course offerings are pretty comprehensive compared to other schools (I think), and usually well-taught. Zimi: Math is one of the bigger departments at MIT so you get to meet a lot of people with many different interests! What are your favorite things about the math department at MIT? Jonathan: cookies at tea time Z: I really appreciated the variety of course offerings, which covered everything I could dream of wanting to learn (and much, much more). Also, the other math majors: I learned a ton from the friends I made. Carl: The MIT math department is rather large, and there’s a great breadth of interests represented at every level (undergrad students, grad students, faculty, etc.). This makes MIT a great place to figure out what (within math) one is interested in. I also like how, by and large, the faculty genuinely care about the quality of the teaching. Tristan: My favorite part of the math department is the active community of students willing to talk about anything math. It’s always great to have peers who are excited about the same things as I am! What are your least favorite things about the math department at MIT? Jonathan: cookies at tea time – I think I’ve eaten too many. Z: The fact that there are so many strong math majors makes it very easy to fall through the cracks, which can make coursework and life difficult. Carl: There are so many undergraduate students who are interested in math, which is fantastic! Unfortunately, many opportunities that the math department offers (UROPs, DRP, SPUR) ⁠ 09 summer program in undergraduate research are resource-constrained, and the upshot of this is that they end up being available mostly to the students who came in with a lot of background, or who have very visible and measurable accomplishments to distinguish them from the crowd. This means that, while some students get fantastic opportunities and support, some get very little. I believe this dynamic also pushes some students out of considering mathematics, which is a shame. Misheel: MIT doesn’t have good infrastructure for grad students and undergrads to intermingle. For example, from what I have heard, Harvard students share their lounge with the grad students and they learn a ton from them. But on the other hand, the benefit at MIT is that the undergrads intermingle better. Still I think if MIT opened the grad lounge to undergrads it would be good XD Zimi: The administration of the department seems to be a bit out of touch with the undergrads and there seems to be some d ivide between people who did a lot of math before coming to MIT versus people who maybe did not have as much prior exposure to say, competition math, but are just here to learn math. What is your favorite math class you have taken at MIT? Z: I liked a lot of them; two of them worth singling out are 18.783 ⁠ 10 Elliptic Curves and 18.785, ⁠ 11 Number Theory I which I found to be organized and taught very well. Plus, I thought the material was fascinating. Carl: Certainly the most influential class for me was 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Yufei Zhao. I loved the course, and, a few years on, it’s more or less defined my research interests. Tristan: My favorite math class at MIT is 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Professor Yufei Zhao. I knew little about the subject before taking the class, but the course content helped me develop intuition and skills that are quite useful for both the topics covered and also math in general. Matthew: It has to be 18.675, which is “Theory of Probability.” This class focuses on building a rigorous framework to understand what it actually means to define a random variable, and what it means to take the expected value of something, and finishes by talking about interesting topics such as martingales and Brownian motion. I’ve always been more interested in learning about more discrete forms of math (e.g. probability, theoretical computer science) and abstract algebra (group theory, field theory, etc.), but I think this class really made me appreciate why the fields of analysis and measure theory are important. Before I took this class, I had some vague operational notion of what probability meant (“if I flip this coin a bunch of times, I expect it to land on heads around half the time”), and this class taught me how to define probability rigorously. It also doesn’t hurt that a lot of concepts from this class showed up in my research this semester. Misheel: I loved 18.786, ⁠ 12 Number Theory II which was taught by my advisor, and it was even heavily ⁠ 13 Fatima: Misheel loves algebra! algebra-oriented than other iterations of the class. Another class I really liked is 18.102, ⁠ 14 Functional Analysis which was taught in a really fun way by Professor Melrose. I loved the fact that it was the intersection of algebra and analysis (or just the fact that it has really interesting algebra lol). What is your least favorite math class you have taken at MIT? Z: I hate to say it but 18.404, ⁠ 15 Fatima: Theory of Computation SOBBBB but ONLY because I discovered I was personally not really interested in the content after all; the class itself is very popular (for good reason) and organized very carefully. I’m still glad I took it, though. 16 Fatima: I would probably say Real Analysis for me, but it was a little my fault. I took it too early without enough background with proofs. My thoughts on analysis have since changed (yay functional analysis!) Any thoughts on how to best work with people with many differing backgrounds? Jonathan: People with different backgrounds often have different names for the same thing – try to learn as many of these names as possible. Z: (Unfortunately I don’t have too much experience with this.) My only experience with something like this at MIT came from taking 18.821. ⁠ 17 Project Laboratory. one of the communication intensive offerings in the math department where you choose some different problems over the semester and work on them with your teammates. at least that is what my former advisor's edition was supposed to look like. My teammates were extremely friendly, accommodating, and hardworking, and we were naturally interested in different aspects of our projects so there were no conflicts :P. Tristan: When working with people from different backgrounds, it’s useful to get an idea of what type of things different people work better at. For example, mathematicians in different areas might bring different techniques to the table, and some might be able to be applied to various parts of the problem. Did you ever feel at any point that you didn’t belong in the department? Did that ever go away? Why/why not? Z: I experienced this freshman fall and was very intimidated by many of my classmates. For me the feeling did disappear eventually, because somehow I gradually became friends with some of those people, and found they were very friendly and willing to help me with math (and of course, they were normal people outside of math). I think I was pretty lucky, though. Matthew: To some extent I have always felt this a little–I think that I really enjoy studying (some areas of) math, but at the same time I don’t feel like I really committed to taking many math classes–I enjoy taking classes from a wide range of courses (CS, biology, physics, math). I think the math department also tends to consist of a lot of students who are double-majoring in other fields because the requirements to be a Course 18 are relatively not as strict to satisfy, and I do have many friends (hi Fatima!!) who are Course 18s, so in that sense I do feel like I belong. Zimi: Fun fact: when I first declared my major I thought I was going to be in the EECS ⁠ 18 electrical engineering and computer science department/more closely associated with EECS for some reason. So I was very surprised when I received an email addressed to “new math majors.” Before starting college I didn’t really think about studying math, so it took me a while to get used to calling myself a math major. Sometimes I do feel like I don’t quite belong here. This feeling was stronger in the first two years in college—I didn’t do a lot of math in high school, so seeing people who were taking advanced classes and knew each other from high school math competitions was a bit fear-inducing. But there are a lot of other people in the department without too much background prior to coming to college. As I said before, I still wouldn’t consider myself someone who “does math,” but over time, I found myself feeling that I belong here more than I did in the beginning. What are some skills you have found to be most useful as a mathematician? Jonathan: This is not exactly a skill, but I’ve found it helpful to approach problems from a computational or a geometric/visualization perspective. But probably the most useful skill is figuring out how to interest other people in solving your problems! Z: Passion and interest in the material is probably the most important for me, as it makes it much easier to find motivation to work. It’s also important to be willing/able to think very carefully and thoroughly, especially when first working with proofs. I also found it helpful to be unashamed to say things like “I can’t because I have to pset.” Carl: Being able to look at a problem from different perspectives. So much of research mathematics is staring at a very hard problem and having no idea how to attack it. Solutions, when they come at all, often come from unexpected sources. (I think this can be explained by conditional probability — if a problem is interesting, conditioning on it not having been solved, progress is more likely to come from an unexpected idea than a standard one.) Tristan: I think that being able to communicate effectively is extremely important to doing math. It’s easier to collaborate that way, to convince others of the correctness of your argument, and to teach math. Matthew: I think being able to struggle on problems for long periods of time without giving up even when becoming frustrated is important–often problems can take a while, and it can feel like you’re getting nowhere. This seems to be true of many difficult things though, so I think this is just generally useful at MIT. Misheel: Talking to people! Maybe this is specific to me, but I’m kind of bad at actually doing things, ⁠ 19 Fatima: completely incorrect! but a lot better at coming up with random ideas (most of them useless ones). So having someone to bounce and filter ideas and essentially “storing ideas externally” makes working on problems and stuff much better and way more fun. Also talking to people is a useful skill in general and later on in life if you want to collaborate with people. I think being able to write well is a really powerful skill as well. What is the most rewarding part of your job/doing math? Z: Kind of a lame answer, but mostly just the math itself. The friends are cool too but occasionally mid. Carl: Going from being utterly mystified by something to understanding it, even just a little. Tristan: The most rewarding part about doing math is getting to talk to other people about it. When I’m done with a cool problem or just finished learning something new, I always look forward to talking with peers about it, understanding the subject better and sharing our excitement over math. Misheel: The feeling of learning cool things and making cool concepts connect in cool ways. The exploring aspect. Understanding someone explain super high level math and recognizing a few words you learned recently and then using those words in a sentence where it kinda makes sense is very cool. Anything else you would like to add! Z: Do math! math is good Thanks to Paige B. ’24 for helping with the questions and to everyone else for answering the questions :))!

At the moment, i am a math major with some interest to double major in computer science. i love writing and will try to make a poem out of almost everything. i will romanticize the very mundane and tell you twice a day that something is ~so poetic~. i live in Next House and i hate walking. on the contrary, i do love people and do a lot of things that involve people. having had at least two cups of milk tea every day for most of my life, i love milk tea! if you don’t, we can’t be friends, sorry not sorry. my go-to mode of expressing excitement is repeating the last letter in all my messages and using too many exclamation points(they are the only valid punctuation!) and why i am here? the only hope is to slow time down with our slightly longer stories and slightly unimportant details.

'25 math month post April 24, 2024 in Classes , Majors & Minors I asked a bunch of people, professors, current and former students why they do math and their thoughts on the MIT math department. Here is what they had to say! Short introductions! Jonathan: My name is Jonathan. I joined the department as a postdoc last year. I’m interested in topology, which is the study of flexible shapes like knots or rubber surfaces. We can’t use the traditional geometrical measurements like length or area to characterize these shapes since they aren’t rigid. So we develop more robust measurements like counting the number of holes in the shape. 01 Fatima: I took Seminar in Topology last semester with Jonathan! (let’s call them) Z: I’m a recent MIT alum who majored in 18, and now in a math PhD program. Carl S. ’23: I’m Carl, and I’m a first-year math PhD student at Stanford. My main interest is extremal combinatorics, but I’m also interested in analytic number theory (and maybe some other analytic things). Tristan S. ’23: I’m a 2023 graduate of the math and music majors, currently a master’s student at the University of Cambridge. Matthew H. ’25: Hi! I’m Matthew, a ‘25 who lives in Next House. I’m a former Californian who enjoys playing tennis, chess-related activities, and watching local sports teams. Misheel O. ’25: I’m a junior at MIT studying math and CS, and I watch anime and stuff. ⁠ 02 know an xkcd for every situation Zimi Z. ’25: I am a third-year student in course 18C (Math with Computer Science). As the name of my major suggests, I do a lot of things involving math and computer science and both. Why do you do math? Professor Cohn ⁠ 03 Fatima: I took Algebra I with Professor Cohn last fall! : One of the things I love about math is that we’re all on the same team. Of course I’m not the world’s greatest mathematician: I’ve done some interesting mathematics, but there are others who are more accomplished. If math were a competition to be the best, I might as well give up now, because I have no hope of “winning math” (whatever that might mean). Fortunately, that’s just not how it works. If someone else proves an amazing theorem, their achievement doesn’t make my work any less interesting or significant. Instead, the more we learn, the more fascinating and valuable mathematics as a whole becomes. We’re all working together to figure out the answers to questions we share an interest in. As in all human activities, there’s occasionally competition for jobs or prizes, but competition is not the point of mathematics. Other mathematicians are my friends and colleagues, not my rivals. The reason I want to emphasize this is because of how incredibly successful MIT students have been in the Putnam exam (see here ). There are many amazingly quick and insightful students at MIT, and I think people sometimes get the impression that success as a math major must mean being able to come up with ingenious solutions to carefully posed problems under time pressure. That’s an impressive skill, but it’s not the most important skill a mathematician can have, or necessary for success. It’s important to celebrate achievements in math competitions without letting them overshadow other forms of promise or achievement. 04 Fatima: This answers a bunch of the questions that follow, but I didn't want to break it up because so true!! Jonathan: I enjoy the mystery of it. You’ll often see some patterns that you can’t explain, but after working hard to understand the objects better, the patterns become natural and inevitable. Z: I’ve been interested in math for basically my whole life, initially through math competitions but now for the math itself, which I find both interesting and beautiful. Carl: I’ve pretty much always been more interested in math than anything else. This has maintained since I was about four years old, despite the fact that what “math” means has changed a lot — from arithmetic to short-answer questions to olympiads to college classes and now to research. I’ve essentially followed the “path of most math” for most of my life up to this point: I considered studying CS or physics in college, but liked math more; I explored quantitative finance and software development, but preferred research math. I’m pretty happy with where this path has brought me, and there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing. Matthew: I like the combination of intuition and rigor–I believe the former is more important to me, but I think being able to understand concepts from the ground up is satisfying. I also think that understanding the explanations of various phenomena through math is something that I value, which is why I take a lot of classes in subjects that aren’t math, but involve math to a reasonably high degree (for example: I took Systems Biology, where a large focus of the class was understanding how systems of molecules that regulate each other behave, which can be modeled using dynamical systems.) Misheel: I like doing math because I like the idea of figuring things out and/or understanding things. It’s really hard to say really general stuff, but if you assume a small number of reasonable things (axioms), then suddenly those concepts connect together and you get an explosion of connections and new concepts that you can learn and explore. I also play a lot of video games (or used to before college lol) so I like making video game analogies. In this case, the axioms are sort of like a seed for a world in minecraft and you explore what grows out of that seed and do cool stuff. Another analogy is that research in general feels like exploration as well, like exploring every corner of a room before moving on, and I enjoy that a lot. Running a dfs ⁠ 05 depth first search in some sense. ⁠ 06 Misheel: it is important to contrast the need for dfs in research with the danger of dfs in learning because if you dfs in learning, you really can't stop and you'll have very specific knowledge about a few fields but not a lot of foundation. so for studying bfs (breadth first search) is better or something. Zimi: Good question, I don’t know if I would call myself someone who “does math” as I have not engaged too much in math besides taking classes. I take these classes mostly because they are fun! I have not participated in a math UROP or DRP, ⁠ 07 directed reading program. during IAP, math majors can sign up to read some math topic of their choice with a mentor. which is honestly something I regret a little. What do you think is one of the hardest things to get right in math pedagogy? 08 Fatima: For some reason, I did not send this question to any of the students. I regret that! People probably had thoughts from the other side and a lot of students also TA classes anyway. Jonathan: Math is very interconnected, and the best way to learn a subject is to get acquainted with examples and intuition from neighbouring areas. So it’s difficult to teach math in a linear way! I wish I could continue my classes with students after a couple semesters, and circle back to old material with new context from other subjects they’ve learned. What are your thoughts on the math department at MIT? Jonathan: It’s really nice being surrounded by people (students and faculty alike) excited about math and working on such interesting problems! Z: The MIT math department (including both pure and applied) is one of the best in the world, and in particular the undergrad math population has been insanely strong the past few years (see Putnam results…). It’s also worth mentioning that the standard course offerings are pretty comprehensive compared to other schools (I think), and usually well-taught. Zimi: Math is one of the bigger departments at MIT so you get to meet a lot of people with many different interests! What are your favorite things about the math department at MIT? Jonathan: cookies at tea time Z: I really appreciated the variety of course offerings, which covered everything I could dream of wanting to learn (and much, much more). Also, the other math majors: I learned a ton from the friends I made. Carl: The MIT math department is rather large, and there’s a great breadth of interests represented at every level (undergrad students, grad students, faculty, etc.). This makes MIT a great place to figure out what (within math) one is interested in. I also like how, by and large, the faculty genuinely care about the quality of the teaching. Tristan: My favorite part of the math department is the active community of students willing to talk about anything math. It’s always great to have peers who are excited about the same things as I am! What are your least favorite things about the math department at MIT? Jonathan: cookies at tea time – I think I’ve eaten too many. Z: The fact that there are so many strong math majors makes it very easy to fall through the cracks, which can make coursework and life difficult. Carl: There are so many undergraduate students who are interested in math, which is fantastic! Unfortunately, many opportunities that the math department offers (UROPs, DRP, SPUR) ⁠ 09 summer program in undergraduate research are resource-constrained, and the upshot of this is that they end up being available mostly to the students who came in with a lot of background, or who have very visible and measurable accomplishments to distinguish them from the crowd. This means that, while some students get fantastic opportunities and support, some get very little. I believe this dynamic also pushes some students out of considering mathematics, which is a shame. Misheel: MIT doesn’t have good infrastructure for grad students and undergrads to intermingle. For example, from what I have heard, Harvard students share their lounge with the grad students and they learn a ton from them. But on the other hand, the benefit at MIT is that the undergrads intermingle better. Still I think if MIT opened the grad lounge to undergrads it would be good XD Zimi: The administration of the department seems to be a bit out of touch with the undergrads and there seems to be some d ivide between people who did a lot of math before coming to MIT versus people who maybe did not have as much prior exposure to say, competition math, but are just here to learn math. What is your favorite math class you have taken at MIT? Z: I liked a lot of them; two of them worth singling out are 18.783 ⁠ 10 Elliptic Curves and 18.785, ⁠ 11 Number Theory I which I found to be organized and taught very well. Plus, I thought the material was fascinating. Carl: Certainly the most influential class for me was 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Yufei Zhao. I loved the course, and, a few years on, it’s more or less defined my research interests. Tristan: My favorite math class at MIT is 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Professor Yufei Zhao. I knew little about the subject before taking the class, but the course content helped me develop intuition and skills that are quite useful for both the topics covered and also math in general. Matthew: It has to be 18.675, which is “Theory of Probability.” This class focuses on building a rigorous framework to understand what it actually means to define a random variable, and what it means to take the expected value of something, and finishes by talking about interesting topics such as martingales and Brownian motion. I’ve always been more interested in learning about more discrete forms of math (e.g. probability, theoretical computer science) and abstract algebra (group theory, field theory, etc.), but I think this class really made me appreciate why the fields of analysis and measure theory are important. Before I took this class, I had some vague operational notion of what probability meant (“if I flip this coin a bunch of times, I expect it to land on heads around half the time”), and this class taught me how to define probability rigorously. It also doesn’t hurt that a lot of concepts from this class showed up in my research this semester. Misheel: I loved 18.786, ⁠ 12 Number Theory II which was taught by my advisor, and it was even heavily ⁠ 13 Fatima: Misheel loves algebra! algebra-oriented than other iterations of the class. Another class I really liked is 18.102, ⁠ 14 Functional Analysis which was taught in a really fun way by Professor Melrose. I loved the fact that it was the intersection of algebra and analysis (or just the fact that it has really interesting algebra lol). What is your least favorite math class you have taken at MIT? Z: I hate to say it but 18.404, ⁠ 15 Fatima: Theory of Computation SOBBBB but ONLY because I discovered I was personally not really interested in the content after all; the class itself is very popular (for good reason) and organized very carefully. I’m still glad I took it, though. 16 Fatima: I would probably say Real Analysis for me, but it was a little my fault. I took it too early without enough background with proofs. My thoughts on analysis have since changed (yay functional analysis!) Any thoughts on how to best work with people with many differing backgrounds? Jonathan: People with different backgrounds often have different names for the same thing – try to learn as many of these names as possible. Z: (Unfortunately I don’t have too much experience with this.) My only experience with something like this at MIT came from taking 18.821. ⁠ 17 Project Laboratory. one of the communication intensive offerings in the math department where you choose some different problems over the semester and work on them with your teammates. at least that is what my former advisor's edition was supposed to look like. My teammates were extremely friendly, accommodating, and hardworking, and we were naturally interested in different aspects of our projects so there were no conflicts :P. Tristan: When working with people from different backgrounds, it’s useful to get an idea of what type of things different people work better at. For example, mathematicians in different areas might bring different techniques to the table, and some might be able to be applied to various parts of the problem. Did you ever feel at any point that you didn’t belong in the department? Did that ever go away? Why/why not? Z: I experienced this freshman fall and was very intimidated by many of my classmates. For me the feeling did disappear eventually, because somehow I gradually became friends with some of those people, and found they were very friendly and willing to help me with math (and of course, they were normal people outside of math). I think I was pretty lucky, though. Matthew: To some extent I have always felt this a little–I think that I really enjoy studying (some areas of) math, but at the same time I don’t feel like I really committed to taking many math classes–I enjoy taking classes from a wide range of courses (CS, biology, physics, math). I think the math department also tends to consist of a lot of students who are double-majoring in other fields because the requirements to be a Course 18 are relatively not as strict to satisfy, and I do have many friends (hi Fatima!!) who are Course 18s, so in that sense I do feel like I belong. Zimi: Fun fact: when I first declared my major I thought I was going to be in the EECS ⁠ 18 electrical engineering and computer science department/more closely associated with EECS for some reason. So I was very surprised when I received an email addressed to “new math majors.” Before starting college I didn’t really think about studying math, so it took me a while to get used to calling myself a math major. Sometimes I do feel like I don’t quite belong here. This feeling was stronger in the first two years in college—I didn’t do a lot of math in high school, so seeing people who were taking advanced classes and knew each other from high school math competitions was a bit fear-inducing. But there are a lot of other people in the department without too much background prior to coming to college. As I said before, I still wouldn’t consider myself someone who “does math,” but over time, I found myself feeling that I belong here more than I did in the beginning. What are some skills you have found to be most useful as a mathematician? Jonathan: This is not exactly a skill, but I’ve found it helpful to approach problems from a computational or a geometric/visualization perspective. But probably the most useful skill is figuring out how to interest other people in solving your problems! Z: Passion and interest in the material is probably the most important for me, as it makes it much easier to find motivation to work. It’s also important to be willing/able to think very carefully and thoroughly, especially when first working with proofs. I also found it helpful to be unashamed to say things like “I can’t because I have to pset.” Carl: Being able to look at a problem from different perspectives. So much of research mathematics is staring at a very hard problem and having no idea how to attack it. Solutions, when they come at all, often come from unexpected sources. (I think this can be explained by conditional probability — if a problem is interesting, conditioning on it not having been solved, progress is more likely to come from an unexpected idea than a standard one.) Tristan: I think that being able to communicate effectively is extremely important to doing math. It’s easier to collaborate that way, to convince others of the correctness of your argument, and to teach math. Matthew: I think being able to struggle on problems for long periods of time without giving up even when becoming frustrated is important–often problems can take a while, and it can feel like you’re getting nowhere. This seems to be true of many difficult things though, so I think this is just generally useful at MIT. Misheel: Talking to people! Maybe this is specific to me, but I’m kind of bad at actually doing things, ⁠ 19 Fatima: completely incorrect! but a lot better at coming up with random ideas (most of them useless ones). So having someone to bounce and filter ideas and essentially “storing ideas externally” makes working on problems and stuff much better and way more fun. Also talking to people is a useful skill in general and later on in life if you want to collaborate with people. I think being able to write well is a really powerful skill as well. What is the most rewarding part of your job/doing math? Z: Kind of a lame answer, but mostly just the math itself. The friends are cool too but occasionally mid. Carl: Going from being utterly mystified by something to understanding it, even just a little. Tristan: The most rewarding part about doing math is getting to talk to other people about it. When I’m done with a cool problem or just finished learning something new, I always look forward to talking with peers about it, understanding the subject better and sharing our excitement over math. Misheel: The feeling of learning cool things and making cool concepts connect in cool ways. The exploring aspect. Understanding someone explain super high level math and recognizing a few words you learned recently and then using those words in a sentence where it kinda makes sense is very cool. Anything else you would like to add! Z: Do math! math is good Thanks to Paige B. ’24 for helping with the questions and to everyone else for answering the questions :))!

'25 thoughts on injuries and spring season April 23, 2024 in Athletics Spring season has started, and guess who got to lace up their cleats and practice for the first time in eight and a half months? You guessed it: I did! Since my injury in preseason this past fall, where a collision in our scrimmage against Harvard left me with a broken bone and a partially torn ligament in my right foot, it’s been a physical and emotional roller coaster. As a junior, it was a bit tough to sit on the sidelines and watch the season slowly slip through my fingers. I remember going to the trainer right after the scrimmage, thinking my foot was just a bit bruised. When they told me I should start wearing a boot, just in case, I couldn’t help but cry – I didn’t want something I had worked so hard for to be taken away by a stupid, split-second collision. Little did I know that I would get well-acquainted with that boot over the next two months. My first X-ray had great news: no broken bones! The follow-up MRI, not so much. The bone I had broken was so small that it only showed up on an MRI. Even worse, my Lisfranc, the ligament holding my foot together, was simply not intact. It was not fully torn, thank goodness. If it had been, I would’ve been looking at a surgery that would leave me unable to put weight on the foot for three months. Nevertheless, I was in a boot for two months, and I felt totally trapped. I’ve been playing soccer almost non-stop since first grade, and this has been the longest I’ve ever not played my sport. It was weird to have my body struggle so much with something I did naturally my whole life. Instead of walking, I was dragging, hopping, or sliding around if I didn’t have my boot on. And even once I finally was free from the boot, I had to relearn how to walk properly. I had developed funny walking habits from wearing the boot: swinging my leg like a club-footed pirate and limping a bit because my feet were at different heights. Despite that, I finally felt like a great weight had been lifted from me. After the boot was off, it was months of physical therapy. Putting weight on the foot was a scary and mighty endeavor. The thought of running seemed so far-fetched. The thought of smashing a ball with my foot seemed even more impossible. As my foot improved, and as the limp vanished, every step felt just a bit lighter. But I always had my eyes set on the end goal: playing soccer again. Fast forward to now: the start of spring season. For the first time since August, I’m going to the locker room and lacing up my cleats – me lacing up the cleats, not watching everyone else do it – and it’s already a dream come true. Putting on the practice jersey, bringing my ball out to practice – all of it is so simple and routine, but suddenly it now seems so special. I’m not fully 100% yet. I’m building back to playing for long periods of time, because my foot gets pretty sore after playing a lot, so I am only allowed to play for about half a practice. I also can’t play full contact yet, which means that I can’t run into other players and can only do more technical drills like passing and dribbling. But here’s what I can do: I can run now. Not even just run, I can sprint . I lead my own line at warmup, because now is when the juniors start taking over the leadership role from the seniors. I can pass, not yet smashing them as hard as I used to, but I’m building up to it. I can play keep-away, I can juggle, I can dribble past mannequins, and I can do it all with my team. I finally feel like an athlete again, and throughout all the eight months of recovery and hardship, that is the feeling I wanted to regain the most. As the spring season continues, and as the days grow longer and warmer, I hope that my progress also continues. I hope that all the work I’ve put in will continue to pay off. Something I will always be grateful for is that, when soccer suddenly disappeared, I had an entire community to lean on. My teammates, coaches, and the athletic trainers were there for me every step of the way, asking me about my recovery progress and never letting me forget that I was still a part of the team. Thanks, guys :) Any kind of injury – or unforeseen setback, really – is so incredibly tough. Something changes just like that, and suddenly there is a before and an after . Clawing your way out of that mess, building yourself back up, is a day-in and day-out effort. It’s like melted down iron that must be reforged and rehammered into shape. Even though I am still on the road to recovery, I finally feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have learned to treasure and love the daily things, the routine things. And I have also learned that if something is taken from me, I will do my very best to get it back. That’s all for now! I gotta go get changed for practice :) cleats on feet, smile on face :D Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

My name is Emiko, but feel free to call me Emi :) I’m from St. Louis, Missouri, and I spent most of my time growing up messing around with my three younger siblings, playing soccer and road tripping to tournaments with my dad, going on picnics at the park with my friends, and devouring fantasy and sci-fi books. At MIT, I am an attacking midfielder on the women’s soccer team, a member of a sorority called Alpha Phi, and am majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I came to MIT having never coded or engineered anything, so I’m excited to share what it’s like to learn something from scratch at MIT. My whip on campus is an electric scooter called the Swagger 5 (its nickname is Swagathon, pronounced like Johnathon). I have a lot of hot takes regarding food: I love a cold glass of whole milk, peanut butter is yucky, and Arbys is delish. I’m super excited to take you all along with me to the classroom, to my soccer games, and to all the other crazy adventures MIT has to offer!

'25 thoughts on injuries and spring season April 23, 2024 in Athletics Spring season has started, and guess who got to lace up their cleats and practice for the first time in eight and a half months? You guessed it: I did! Since my injury in preseason this past fall, where a collision in our scrimmage against Harvard left me with a broken bone and a partially torn ligament in my right foot, it’s been a physical and emotional roller coaster. As a junior, it was a bit tough to sit on the sidelines and watch the season slowly slip through my fingers. I remember going to the trainer right after the scrimmage, thinking my foot was just a bit bruised. When they told me I should start wearing a boot, just in case, I couldn’t help but cry – I didn’t want something I had worked so hard for to be taken away by a stupid, split-second collision. Little did I know that I would get well-acquainted with that boot over the next two months. My first X-ray had great news: no broken bones! The follow-up MRI, not so much. The bone I had broken was so small that it only showed up on an MRI. Even worse, my Lisfranc, the ligament holding my foot together, was simply not intact. It was not fully torn, thank goodness. If it had been, I would’ve been looking at a surgery that would leave me unable to put weight on the foot for three months. Nevertheless, I was in a boot for two months, and I felt totally trapped. I’ve been playing soccer almost non-stop since first grade, and this has been the longest I’ve ever not played my sport. It was weird to have my body struggle so much with something I did naturally my whole life. Instead of walking, I was dragging, hopping, or sliding around if I didn’t have my boot on. And even once I finally was free from the boot, I had to relearn how to walk properly. I had developed funny walking habits from wearing the boot: swinging my leg like a club-footed pirate and limping a bit because my feet were at different heights. Despite that, I finally felt like a great weight had been lifted from me. After the boot was off, it was months of physical therapy. Putting weight on the foot was a scary and mighty endeavor. The thought of running seemed so far-fetched. The thought of smashing a ball with my foot seemed even more impossible. As my foot improved, and as the limp vanished, every step felt just a bit lighter. But I always had my eyes set on the end goal: playing soccer again. Fast forward to now: the start of spring season. For the first time since August, I’m going to the locker room and lacing up my cleats – me lacing up the cleats, not watching everyone else do it – and it’s already a dream come true. Putting on the practice jersey, bringing my ball out to practice – all of it is so simple and routine, but suddenly it now seems so special. I’m not fully 100% yet. I’m building back to playing for long periods of time, because my foot gets pretty sore after playing a lot, so I am only allowed to play for about half a practice. I also can’t play full contact yet, which means that I can’t run into other players and can only do more technical drills like passing and dribbling. But here’s what I can do: I can run now. Not even just run, I can sprint . I lead my own line at warmup, because now is when the juniors start taking over the leadership role from the seniors. I can pass, not yet smashing them as hard as I used to, but I’m building up to it. I can play keep-away, I can juggle, I can dribble past mannequins, and I can do it all with my team. I finally feel like an athlete again, and throughout all the eight months of recovery and hardship, that is the feeling I wanted to regain the most. As the spring season continues, and as the days grow longer and warmer, I hope that my progress also continues. I hope that all the work I’ve put in will continue to pay off. Something I will always be grateful for is that, when soccer suddenly disappeared, I had an entire community to lean on. My teammates, coaches, and the athletic trainers were there for me every step of the way, asking me about my recovery progress and never letting me forget that I was still a part of the team. Thanks, guys :) Any kind of injury – or unforeseen setback, really – is so incredibly tough. Something changes just like that, and suddenly there is a before and an after . Clawing your way out of that mess, building yourself back up, is a day-in and day-out effort. It’s like melted down iron that must be reforged and rehammered into shape. Even though I am still on the road to recovery, I finally feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have learned to treasure and love the daily things, the routine things. And I have also learned that if something is taken from me, I will do my very best to get it back. That’s all for now! I gotta go get changed for practice :) cleats on feet, smile on face :D Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

'24 a math month post April 23, 2024 in Academics & Research , UROP & Other Research Unfortunately I don’t think I will be talking about the duality between points and lines that Andi alluded to in his post on duality (though maybe I will later this month/semester we will see). But this is a post for MITAdmissions Math Month, and thusly there will be some math. And perhaps some thoughts about life at MIT too. If you’re not as interested in the math stuff, you can scroll on through to Part 2 where I talk about some thoughts about life at MIT :). The math in the first part is some material I learned (and still love) from the UROP I did the summer after my first year at MIT. Part 1: The Loomis-Whitney inequality (aka the math part) Take your favorite set of finitely many points out in the plane, i.e. in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let’s call this set $A$. Now, suppose we look at the “shadow” of $A$ on the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, and let’s call these sets $\\pi_x(A)$ and $\\pi_y(A)$ respectively. If it helps you to see it written down mathematically, we have the functions $\\pi_x(x,y) = x$ and $\\pi_y(x,y) = y$. See the below diagram for further clarity. Projections of the point (x,y). One question we can ask is the following: If we only know about the size (i.e. how many) points there are in the shadows of $A$, can we get a good bound on $A$ itself? The answer, in 2-dimensions, is quite immediate: Yes. For every point in $\\pi_x(A)$, we can draw the corresponding line that maps to this point under the projection, called the fibers of this projection. Similarly, we can draw every fiber corresponding to $\\pi_y(A)$, and we will notice that the set $A$ must lie at the intersection of the fibers from the $x$-axis and the fibers from the $y$-axis (depicted below). The set A here (in green) is contained in the fibers of its projections onto the x and y axes. To write this down mathematically, what we have proven is that \\[A \\subset [\\pi_x^{-1}(\\pi_x(A)) \\cap \\pi_y^{-1}(\\pi_y(A))],\\] and as such, we have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_x(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_y(A)|.\\] Or, if you prefer more directly, we have \\[A \\subset \\pi_x(A) \\times \\pi_y(A),\\] (though this won’t generalize in higher dimensions– at least not what I am going to present in higher dimensions). I.e., the number of points in $A$ is bounded by the number of points in the projection onto the $x$-axis times the number of points in the projection onto the $y$-axis. Okay, but how good is this bound? To understand how good this bound is, we can first consider dimensional analysis — a technique that is taught early on in 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) at MIT. The idea is the following: Suppose that we measured “volume” in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in square inches, i.e. $(\\text{inches})^2$. If this were the case, then the shadows of $A$ onto the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis must be measured in inches. Therefore, looking at the above inequality (and replacing $A$ with its units and $\\pi_x(A)$/$\\pi_y(A)$ it their units), we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^2) \\leq (\\text{inches})\\cdot (\\text{inches}).\\] Given that we have inches squared on both sides, we might suspect that our inequality here is very good (for arbitrary finite sets in $\\mathbb{R}^2$), and in fact it is! To see just how good out bound is, all we need is one example of a set $A$ where the inequality is an equality, and here is that example: Take your set $A$ to be the set of integer lattice points, where each coordinate is an integer between $1$ and $N$ ($N$ here being some large number). Then, in total, we have that $|A| = N^2$ while $|\\pi_x(A)| = |\\pi_y(A)| = N$. A good example to keep in mind that shows that the inequality we proved is in fact (sometimes) an equality). Can you find another such set that leads to an equality? Hence, we have found a set where the inquality is an equality, and thus out bound is as good as one could’ve hoped for. Exercise: Find an example of a set with roughly (up to some constant) $N$ points, whose projection onto the $x$- and $y$-axes has precisely $N$ points each. I.e., find an example of a set where the bound we got is really really bad. Okay cool– that was a lot of math (and it is about to be quite a bit more in just a second), but let’s take a breath. What did we do ? Well, essentially, we bounded the area of a set by the lengths of its shadows. And though this proof was fairly short, we might expect that the same thing holds in higher dimensions, which is in fact the case. In this post, the most we will do is study this in 3-dimensions, which we do now. The proof will be a little bit lengthy, but that is kinda the point of this blogpost (see Part 2). Let $A$ be a finite set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. a bunch of points out in 3-dimensional space. Our goal is to (again) bound the number of points in $A$, i.e. $|A|$, by the number of points in its projections (i.e. projections onto the $xy$-, $yz$-, and $xz$-planes). Note: we denote these projections: $\\pi_{xy}, \\pi_{yz}$, and $\\pi_{xz}$ respectively. More specifically, if it is helpful to see written down, we will have that \\begin{align*} \\pi_{xy}(x,y,z) &= (x,y) \\\\ \\pi_{yz} (x,y,z) &= (y,z) \\\\. \\pi_{xz}(x,y,z) &= (x,z).\\end{align*} the xy, yz, and xz planes in three dimensions. The point (x,y,z) and its images under projections onto the 3 coordiante planes. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Before we go into the proof of such a bound, let’s use dimensional analysis to figure out what this bound should look like. Namely speaking, we may expect to have a bound of the following form: \\[|A| \\leq (|\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|)^{\\alpha}\\] for some constant $\\alpha$. Why might we expect this? Well, given our set $A$ is arbitrary, we should expect that no particular plane should be favored– i.e. there should be a symmetry to our bounds (as we have in the above formula). Secondly, and perhaps less rigorously– this bound looks the same as in the 2-dimensional case. So, for now, supposing that such a bound holds, let’s figure out what $\\alpha$ should be by dimensional analysis. We measure $A$ in cubic inches and the projections (onto the 2-dimensional planes) in square inches. As such, we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^3) \\leq [(\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)]^\\alpha.\\] Hence, to get (at least through dimensional analysis) best bound we can hope for, we may expect $\\alpha = 1/2$. In fact, this is the case: Theorem : Let $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a finite set of points. Then, \\[|A| \\leq \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|}.\\] We will spend the rest of Part 1 proving this fact, but to do so we will need some new and better ideas. Notice that, it is in fact true that \\[A\\subset [\\pi_{xy}^{-1}(\\pi_{xy}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{yz}^{-1}(\\pi_{yz}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{xz}^{-1}(\\pi_{xz}(A))],\\] and thusly we automatically have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|,\\] but this bound is worse than the one we are trying to obtain (and thusly we will need better ideas). The “better” idea we will need will be to write $|A|$ as a sum. In particular, consider the function: $\\mathbf{1}_A$, which is 1 on the set $A$ and is 0 otherwise. I.e., \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) = \\begin{cases}1 & (x,y,z) \\in A \\\\ 0 & (x,y,z) \\notin A\\end{cases}.\\] This is known as an indicator function, and it is really helpful for our problem because we have that \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z).\\] I.e., we have written $|A|$ as a sum that we can now manipulate. Not only that, but we can similarly define indicator functions for all of the projections of $A$, namely $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}$, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}$, and $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}$. What can we do with this? Well, we can notice that for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we have \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\] Why is this true? Well, if $(x,y,z)$ is a point in $A$, then by definition $(x,y) \\in \\pi_{xy}(A)$, $(y,z) \\in \\pi_{yz}(A)$, and $(x,z) \\in \\pi_{xz}(A)$, so the left hand side (LHS) of the above inequality is 1 and so is the right hand side (RHS). Note: there may be points where the RHS is 1 but the LHS is 0– Why?? Similarly, if the RHS is zero, then one of the three terms in the product must be zero (say, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)$). If this is the case, then it must be the case that $(x,y,z)$ is not a point of $A$ for any $z$! Therefore, when the RHS is zero, the LHS must be zero. This concludes the proof of the above inequality. Using it, we notice that we can use this in what we have proven thus far, namely: \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\] At this point, I want to use something known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. There are a bajillion (or rather, at least 12 ) proofs of this inequality (none of which are particularly long, but that I don’t want to write down into this blogpost). Basically, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that you can go from sums of products to products of sums (with certain exponents). In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} &\\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\\\ &\\leq \\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\mathbf{1}^2_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2} := I \\times II.\\end{align*} Why was this helpful? Because one can see immediately that $I = \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|}$! Note: Here, we used that $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 =1$. So now we just need to bound the term $II$, or rather $II^2$ so we don’t have to carry the squareroot around everywhere. To do so, we can expand the sum in $z$ into a double sum in $z$ and another (dummy) variable $z’$. In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} II^2 &=\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2 \\\\ &= \\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\sum_{z’} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z’). \\end{align*} Try to see why the above bound is true! Using this, we have that \\begin{align*} &\\leq \\sum_{x,z}\\sum_{y,z’} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’). \\end{align*} Again, try to see why! Rearranging these sums (now that they are independent of one another), we see that \\begin{align*} &= \\sum_{x,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\sum_{y,z’}\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’)  \\\\ &= |\\pi_{xz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|.\\end{align*} Throwing back in the squareroot, we obtain the desired theorem. Exercise: Prove that this bound is good by considering a similar example to the 2-dimensional case. Prove that this bound *can* be bad, i.e. that there is a set in which the inequality (while true) is WAAYYY overkill (for a more technical statement, see the analogous 2-dimensional exercise). Exercise: Depending on your background in calculus, try proving a continuous version of this for “nice enough” sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. I.e., can you use integration (as opposed to discrete sums) to get rid of the assumption the $A$ is finite? Exercise: Try generalizing this in higher dimensions! This is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality. The next difficult case to try perhaps is bounding the volume of a 4-dimensional finite set by the area of it’s projections onto (the 6!) 2-dimensional planes (i.e. the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw-planes). If you find this interesting, consider looking into Alex Iosevich’s “A View From the Top” which is how I learned about this problem. Part 2: The Lessons (aka the life part) Part 2a: okay fine I’m not done talking about math yet– but give me a sec. For those who skipped Part 1 , the tldr of the math problem I was talking about was the following: Given some blob out in space, if you know how large it’s shadow is, can you know (roughly) how large the blob is? That’s is; that’s the problem (and it leads to what is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality). I first learned this proof (of the 3-dimensional) Loomis-Whitney inequality in the summer after my freshman year when I did a reading program with my (soon to be) research advisor Larry Guth and his graduate student Yuqiu Fu. Immediately, I fell in love with the problem (even if it was already solved by Loomis and Whitney all those years ago). The reason I love this problem is two-fold. One: I love that this problem uses tools that I think are fundamentally interesting in how useful/simple they are (e.g., an inequality known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality , or using indicator functions). Two, and perhaps more fundamentally: I love that I can describe this problem in a single sentence: I want to understand some blob by knowing the shadows of the blob. Bam– that’s it. And yet, when I look at the proof in all of it’s glory, I think to myself: this proof is ugly as hell . I mean sure! It works! It’s a complete proof! I can write it down completely from beginning to end. I can explain all the tiny steps that go into the overall proof. And I can admire it’s perfect and elegant use of simple inequalities. And yet. And yet. I look at the proof and think: that was actually really hard to prove algebraically , especially given it was something I expected to be immediately clear. — People sometimes ask me how I got into the type of math that I do. And my response is always this story: In some classes, sometimes there is just something that irks me about a proof. I can write it down from start to finish. Examine all it’s details from beginning to end. And still, it feels too complicated. It seems to hard to be “the right way” to prove something. But alas it is. This is a feeling I have felt in many classes, especially at MIT. Where sometimes, I would solve a homework problem in 18.701: Algebra I, look at it, and think “this must not be the simple way to prove this problem”. And most of the time I would be right. I’d turn to a friend who understood the subject better, and they’d give me a two-line, elegant solution. And then I’d stare at the solution and think to myself: well this seems to be hiding something behind the scenes. Like, there’s some magic that is happening that I don’t see in their two-line proof, and this (in turn) irks me more. Because in both cases, I don’t feel satisfied. So imagine my surprise when I learn this proof in my reading course with Larry and Yuqiu, and I think to myself the same thing. But this time…. This time when I tell Larry that I think the proof feels too complicated for what we are proving– he says he agrees. That he too has thought about whether or not there is a simpler proof for this statement (and as far as I know hasn’t found one). This was one of those few moments that really got me hooked into my area of mathematics: the fact that I could ask a question that I only barely knew how to put into words, and have it be something that others have been curious about before too. Part 2b: okay fine some actual life stuff I got into math for education. I mean, sure, I liked the subject myself, but part of what I liked most about mathematics was figuring out how to best explain/motivate a concept for other people (and thusly for myself too). This is why I ultimately decided that I wanted to become a professor. And as a result, my freshman year I really felt this pressure in every class I took: I’m struggling now so that one day I can explain these concepts to my students. Just work through it– you need to work through it to be a professor. Math is hard, but you just gotta get through this. Get through this. Get through this. At first, education felt like my anchor point. Something to aim for and aspire to. But somewhere along the way, the anchor point became a bit difficult for me to hang onto in quite the same way. What was once “Work through this to become a good professor” became Work through this to get into graduate school. You have to prove yourself to others. You have to prove yourself to you. Struggle through this. Struggle through this. Now that I’ve gotten into graduate school– Now that I know where I will be for the next ~6 years of my life– Now that I am nearly ready to graduate from MIT– — As a mathematician, I look at the proof of the Loomis-Whitney inequality and think to myself: this is beautiful. As an educator, I’m conflicted. I mean sure– I can motivate why I like the proof as a mathematician , but I couldn’t explain the proof to someone on a walk. And because (for me) mathematics has always been deeply intertwined with education, that bothers me. But what bothers me more than that, is that for the past couple of years at MIT I’ve felt like I’ve ignored why that bothers me. I’ve ignored the part of me that wants to think about how I present mathematics in a more accessible way (e.g., this blog). I don’t know. Perhaps that isn’t fully coherent. All of which is to say, I am excited to stop ignoring that irksome feeling in graduate school. Because I made it. In Fall 2025, I will be returning to MIT to pursue my PhD in mathematics.

As someone who believes that there are narrative arcs in real life, I gotta hope my story has (multiple) happy endings. Beyond being an optimist, I'm a mathematician. Or at least, I try to be. I've been interested in math, and more specifically math education, ever since I learned that multiplication was repeated addition in the second grade. One can argue whether or not my understanding of math has increased since then. I'm also a bit of a writer. Or at least, I try to be. I've been blogging since March of 2020 (hmm I wonder what happened that month), and from time to time I write for The Tech. Writing helps me process parts of my college experience, and while it's been an uphill battle here at MIT, I hope that one day I will be able to look back on it and be able to love every flaw and every beauty in my four years of undergrad. Let’s see what else. I have two cats named Schrödinger and Kung Pao, I try to integrate Page puns into my online presence, and my favorite writing faux pas to use recklessly is a good run-on sentence (to spite my fifth grade teacher who said “only Victor Hugo should write sentences that last longer than a paragraph.”). Here's to sentences that last longer than a paragraph, parentheticals that begin (but never end, and the impending ending of my four years at the 'tvte. Let's see how this goes.

'24 a math month post April 23, 2024 in Academics & Research , UROP & Other Research Unfortunately I don’t think I will be talking about the duality between points and lines that Andi alluded to in his post on duality (though maybe I will later this month/semester we will see). But this is a post for MITAdmissions Math Month, and thusly there will be some math. And perhaps some thoughts about life at MIT too. If you’re not as interested in the math stuff, you can scroll on through to Part 2 where I talk about some thoughts about life at MIT :). The math in the first part is some material I learned (and still love) from the UROP I did the summer after my first year at MIT. Part 1: The Loomis-Whitney inequality (aka the math part) Take your favorite set of finitely many points out in the plane, i.e. in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let’s call this set $A$. Now, suppose we look at the “shadow” of $A$ on the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, and let’s call these sets $\\pi_x(A)$ and $\\pi_y(A)$ respectively. If it helps you to see it written down mathematically, we have the functions $\\pi_x(x,y) = x$ and $\\pi_y(x,y) = y$. See the below diagram for further clarity. Projections of the point (x,y). One question we can ask is the following: If we only know about the size (i.e. how many) points there are in the shadows of $A$, can we get a good bound on $A$ itself? The answer, in 2-dimensions, is quite immediate: Yes. For every point in $\\pi_x(A)$, we can draw the corresponding line that maps to this point under the projection, called the fibers of this projection. Similarly, we can draw every fiber corresponding to $\\pi_y(A)$, and we will notice that the set $A$ must lie at the intersection of the fibers from the $x$-axis and the fibers from the $y$-axis (depicted below). The set A here (in green) is contained in the fibers of its projections onto the x and y axes. To write this down mathematically, what we have proven is that \\[A \\subset [\\pi_x^{-1}(\\pi_x(A)) \\cap \\pi_y^{-1}(\\pi_y(A))],\\] and as such, we have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_x(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_y(A)|.\\] Or, if you prefer more directly, we have \\[A \\subset \\pi_x(A) \\times \\pi_y(A),\\] (though this won’t generalize in higher dimensions– at least not what I am going to present in higher dimensions). I.e., the number of points in $A$ is bounded by the number of points in the projection onto the $x$-axis times the number of points in the projection onto the $y$-axis. Okay, but how good is this bound? To understand how good this bound is, we can first consider dimensional analysis — a technique that is taught early on in 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) at MIT. The idea is the following: Suppose that we measured “volume” in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in square inches, i.e. $(\\text{inches})^2$. If this were the case, then the shadows of $A$ onto the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis must be measured in inches. Therefore, looking at the above inequality (and replacing $A$ with its units and $\\pi_x(A)$/$\\pi_y(A)$ it their units), we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^2) \\leq (\\text{inches})\\cdot (\\text{inches}).\\] Given that we have inches squared on both sides, we might suspect that our inequality here is very good (for arbitrary finite sets in $\\mathbb{R}^2$), and in fact it is! To see just how good out bound is, all we need is one example of a set $A$ where the inequality is an equality, and here is that example: Take your set $A$ to be the set of integer lattice points, where each coordinate is an integer between $1$ and $N$ ($N$ here being some large number). Then, in total, we have that $|A| = N^2$ while $|\\pi_x(A)| = |\\pi_y(A)| = N$. A good example to keep in mind that shows that the inequality we proved is in fact (sometimes) an equality). Can you find another such set that leads to an equality? Hence, we have found a set where the inquality is an equality, and thus out bound is as good as one could’ve hoped for. Exercise: Find an example of a set with roughly (up to some constant) $N$ points, whose projection onto the $x$- and $y$-axes has precisely $N$ points each. I.e., find an example of a set where the bound we got is really really bad. Okay cool– that was a lot of math (and it is about to be quite a bit more in just a second), but let’s take a breath. What did we do ? Well, essentially, we bounded the area of a set by the lengths of its shadows. And though this proof was fairly short, we might expect that the same thing holds in higher dimensions, which is in fact the case. In this post, the most we will do is study this in 3-dimensions, which we do now. The proof will be a little bit lengthy, but that is kinda the point of this blogpost (see Part 2). Let $A$ be a finite set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. a bunch of points out in 3-dimensional space. Our goal is to (again) bound the number of points in $A$, i.e. $|A|$, by the number of points in its projections (i.e. projections onto the $xy$-, $yz$-, and $xz$-planes). Note: we denote these projections: $\\pi_{xy}, \\pi_{yz}$, and $\\pi_{xz}$ respectively. More specifically, if it is helpful to see written down, we will have that \\begin{align*} \\pi_{xy}(x,y,z) &= (x,y) \\\\ \\pi_{yz} (x,y,z) &= (y,z) \\\\. \\pi_{xz}(x,y,z) &= (x,z).\\end{align*} the xy, yz, and xz planes in three dimensions. The point (x,y,z) and its images under projections onto the 3 coordiante planes. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Before we go into the proof of such a bound, let’s use dimensional analysis to figure out what this bound should look like. Namely speaking, we may expect to have a bound of the following form: \\[|A| \\leq (|\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|)^{\\alpha}\\] for some constant $\\alpha$. Why might we expect this? Well, given our set $A$ is arbitrary, we should expect that no particular plane should be favored– i.e. there should be a symmetry to our bounds (as we have in the above formula). Secondly, and perhaps less rigorously– this bound looks the same as in the 2-dimensional case. So, for now, supposing that such a bound holds, let’s figure out what $\\alpha$ should be by dimensional analysis. We measure $A$ in cubic inches and the projections (onto the 2-dimensional planes) in square inches. As such, we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^3) \\leq [(\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)]^\\alpha.\\] Hence, to get (at least through dimensional analysis) best bound we can hope for, we may expect $\\alpha = 1/2$. In fact, this is the case: Theorem : Let $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a finite set of points. Then, \\[|A| \\leq \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|}.\\] We will spend the rest of Part 1 proving this fact, but to do so we will need some new and better ideas. Notice that, it is in fact true that \\[A\\subset [\\pi_{xy}^{-1}(\\pi_{xy}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{yz}^{-1}(\\pi_{yz}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{xz}^{-1}(\\pi_{xz}(A))],\\] and thusly we automatically have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|,\\] but this bound is worse than the one we are trying to obtain (and thusly we will need better ideas). The “better” idea we will need will be to write $|A|$ as a sum. In particular, consider the function: $\\mathbf{1}_A$, which is 1 on the set $A$ and is 0 otherwise. I.e., \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) = \\begin{cases}1 & (x,y,z) \\in A \\\\ 0 & (x,y,z) \\notin A\\end{cases}.\\] This is known as an indicator function, and it is really helpful for our problem because we have that \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z).\\] I.e., we have written $|A|$ as a sum that we can now manipulate. Not only that, but we can similarly define indicator functions for all of the projections of $A$, namely $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}$, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}$, and $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}$. What can we do with this? Well, we can notice that for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we have \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\] Why is this true? Well, if $(x,y,z)$ is a point in $A$, then by definition $(x,y) \\in \\pi_{xy}(A)$, $(y,z) \\in \\pi_{yz}(A)$, and $(x,z) \\in \\pi_{xz}(A)$, so the left hand side (LHS) of the above inequality is 1 and so is the right hand side (RHS). Note: there may be points where the RHS is 1 but the LHS is 0– Why?? Similarly, if the RHS is zero, then one of the three terms in the product must be zero (say, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)$). If this is the case, then it must be the case that $(x,y,z)$ is not a point of $A$ for any $z$! Therefore, when the RHS is zero, the LHS must be zero. This concludes the proof of the above inequality. Using it, we notice that we can use this in what we have proven thus far, namely: \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\] At this point, I want to use something known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. There are a bajillion (or rather, at least 12 ) proofs of this inequality (none of which are particularly long, but that I don’t want to write down into this blogpost). Basically, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that you can go from sums of products to products of sums (with certain exponents). In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} &\\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\\\ &\\leq \\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\mathbf{1}^2_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2} := I \\times II.\\end{align*} Why was this helpful? Because one can see immediately that $I = \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|}$! Note: Here, we used that $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 =1$. So now we just need to bound the term $II$, or rather $II^2$ so we don’t have to carry the squareroot around everywhere. To do so, we can expand the sum in $z$ into a double sum in $z$ and another (dummy) variable $z’$. In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} II^2 &=\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2 \\\\ &= \\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\sum_{z’} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z’). \\end{align*} Try to see why the above bound is true! Using this, we have that \\begin{align*} &\\leq \\sum_{x,z}\\sum_{y,z’} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’). \\end{align*} Again, try to see why! Rearranging these sums (now that they are independent of one another), we see that \\begin{align*} &= \\sum_{x,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\sum_{y,z’}\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’)  \\\\ &= |\\pi_{xz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|.\\end{align*} Throwing back in the squareroot, we obtain the desired theorem. Exercise: Prove that this bound is good by considering a similar example to the 2-dimensional case. Prove that this bound *can* be bad, i.e. that there is a set in which the inequality (while true) is WAAYYY overkill (for a more technical statement, see the analogous 2-dimensional exercise). Exercise: Depending on your background in calculus, try proving a continuous version of this for “nice enough” sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. I.e., can you use integration (as opposed to discrete sums) to get rid of the assumption the $A$ is finite? Exercise: Try generalizing this in higher dimensions! This is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality. The next difficult case to try perhaps is bounding the volume of a 4-dimensional finite set by the area of it’s projections onto (the 6!) 2-dimensional planes (i.e. the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw-planes). If you find this interesting, consider looking into Alex Iosevich’s “A View From the Top” which is how I learned about this problem. Part 2: The Lessons (aka the life part) Part 2a: okay fine I’m not done talking about math yet– but give me a sec. For those who skipped Part 1 , the tldr of the math problem I was talking about was the following: Given some blob out in space, if you know how large it’s shadow is, can you know (roughly) how large the blob is? That’s is; that’s the problem (and it leads to what is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality). I first learned this proof (of the 3-dimensional) Loomis-Whitney inequality in the summer after my freshman year when I did a reading program with my (soon to be) research advisor Larry Guth and his graduate student Yuqiu Fu. Immediately, I fell in love with the problem (even if it was already solved by Loomis and Whitney all those years ago). The reason I love this problem is two-fold. One: I love that this problem uses tools that I think are fundamentally interesting in how useful/simple they are (e.g., an inequality known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality , or using indicator functions). Two, and perhaps more fundamentally: I love that I can describe this problem in a single sentence: I want to understand some blob by knowing the shadows of the blob. Bam– that’s it. And yet, when I look at the proof in all of it’s glory, I think to myself: this proof is ugly as hell . I mean sure! It works! It’s a complete proof! I can write it down completely from beginning to end. I can explain all the tiny steps that go into the overall proof. And I can admire it’s perfect and elegant use of simple inequalities. And yet. And yet. I look at the proof and think: that was actually really hard to prove algebraically , especially given it was something I expected to be immediately clear. — People sometimes ask me how I got into the type of math that I do. And my response is always this story: In some classes, sometimes there is just something that irks me about a proof. I can write it down from start to finish. Examine all it’s details from beginning to end. And still, it feels too complicated. It seems to hard to be “the right way” to prove something. But alas it is. This is a feeling I have felt in many classes, especially at MIT. Where sometimes, I would solve a homework problem in 18.701: Algebra I, look at it, and think “this must not be the simple way to prove this problem”. And most of the time I would be right. I’d turn to a friend who understood the subject better, and they’d give me a two-line, elegant solution. And then I’d stare at the solution and think to myself: well this seems to be hiding something behind the scenes. Like, there’s some magic that is happening that I don’t see in their two-line proof, and this (in turn) irks me more. Because in both cases, I don’t feel satisfied. So imagine my surprise when I learn this proof in my reading course with Larry and Yuqiu, and I think to myself the same thing. But this time…. This time when I tell Larry that I think the proof feels too complicated for what we are proving– he says he agrees. That he too has thought about whether or not there is a simpler proof for this statement (and as far as I know hasn’t found one). This was one of those few moments that really got me hooked into my area of mathematics: the fact that I could ask a question that I only barely knew how to put into words, and have it be something that others have been curious about before too. Part 2b: okay fine some actual life stuff I got into math for education. I mean, sure, I liked the subject myself, but part of what I liked most about mathematics was figuring out how to best explain/motivate a concept for other people (and thusly for myself too). This is why I ultimately decided that I wanted to become a professor. And as a result, my freshman year I really felt this pressure in every class I took: I’m struggling now so that one day I can explain these concepts to my students. Just work through it– you need to work through it to be a professor. Math is hard, but you just gotta get through this. Get through this. Get through this. At first, education felt like my anchor point. Something to aim for and aspire to. But somewhere along the way, the anchor point became a bit difficult for me to hang onto in quite the same way. What was once “Work through this to become a good professor” became Work through this to get into graduate school. You have to prove yourself to others. You have to prove yourself to you. Struggle through this. Struggle through this. Now that I’ve gotten into graduate school– Now that I know where I will be for the next ~6 years of my life– Now that I am nearly ready to graduate from MIT– — As a mathematician, I look at the proof of the Loomis-Whitney inequality and think to myself: this is beautiful. As an educator, I’m conflicted. I mean sure– I can motivate why I like the proof as a mathematician , but I couldn’t explain the proof to someone on a walk. And because (for me) mathematics has always been deeply intertwined with education, that bothers me. But what bothers me more than that, is that for the past couple of years at MIT I’ve felt like I’ve ignored why that bothers me. I’ve ignored the part of me that wants to think about how I present mathematics in a more accessible way (e.g., this blog). I don’t know. Perhaps that isn’t fully coherent. All of which is to say, I am excited to stop ignoring that irksome feeling in graduate school. Because I made it. In Fall 2025, I will be returning to MIT to pursue my PhD in mathematics.

Here are several bloggers’ eclipse chasing tales dumped into a compilation blog: Kano Allison Amber Ali Audrey Kano ’25 I felt profoundly small. The world was changing right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do about it. At first, it felt like nothing was happening but, then, the entire landscape transformed. The moment was ephemeral. For totality, the difference between 99% and 100% felt far beyond between 0% and 99%. My eyes began to well, and I couldn’t have prepared myself for the stir of emotions that suddenly flooded me: awe, joy, confusion, denial, and horror. The world shifted for a moment and, slowly but surely, it faded back into what was, as if nothing had happened. I thought about the rise and fall of the sun. Every day, we have a peaceful dawn and an idyllic sundown, yet they seem to mostly exist in the background of our lives. If sunrises and sunsets occurred more rarely, perhaps we would take a longer look at them. Scarcity breeds demand or whatever. In that same vein, if total eclipses occurred daily, would my friends and I have woken up at 4:00 am to drive for 4 hours to the tippity top of Vermont and 10 hours back to arrive back home on a school night at 3:00 am the following day? I planned most of the trip in our Notion page . Here’s the first part of it: Also made a fitting playlist: We had a good crew. I planned the trip. Daina N. ‘25 drove mostly in the city and is an EAPS major, ⁠ 01 Earth, Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences a.k.a. big Earth nerd. Isaac L. ‘25 drove mostly out of the city and is an astrophotographer. Caitlin O. ‘25 was our backup-turned-main driver. Oris S. N. ‘23 is a massive astrophysics nerd in every way and detailed our adventure in an email he sent out to some friends. I forwarded that email over to some of my friends. Here are some excerpts: we did it :) also, i find it cute that the last two trips i went on match up with lyrics from You’re So Vain by Carly Simon (excellent cheeky fun song): Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia To see the total eclipse of the sun ———- Forwarded message ——— From: Oris Date: Tue, Apr 9, 2024 at 8:16 PM Subject: Re: Eclipse of April 8th, 2024 To: oris_pals Hi all, Yesterday, as everyone probably is aware, was a Solar Eclipse day. […] Here is my adventure: creatures of dawn […] We had originally planned to go to St Albans City in Vermont but, early on the way we then decided to go to Newport, VT, given some discouraging changes in St Albans weather forecast. We arrived at Newport at ~8:30am, so we had hours and hours of spare time before the Eclipse started. Yay! viewing location Kano and Daina […] found a small lakeshore beach, the Prouty Beach at Boston Park (yes we went from Boston to Boston haha), that had an spectacularly unobstructed view of the sky. […] After setting my equipment there and testing polar alignment and sun photos, Kano[, Caitlin, and I] went for a stroll in the town. Newport is a lovely town and it was definitely not made to have as many people as it had yesterday lol. […] first contact At 2:16pm EST, April 8th 2024, the spectacle started. […] The totality was predicted for 15:27:07 of where we were. I had my laptop open, monitoring Stellarium the whole time so I could keep track of coverage levels. Every 10 mins I would take a photo of the Sun: After I got that last photo, I had a plan: I’d wait for the totality start, fully experiencing that with no distractions of cameras or telescope, and I’d let myself be on that state for 30s in totality, when then I’d snap back to take a photo of it and once I was satisfied, go back to the experiencing it with no distractions so I could see it end. […] Now, I’m not proud of it, but I did glance at the Sun without my glasses a few times (please NEVER do that, I was being stupid). […] Some takeaways from these small experiences: DON’T DO IT it is dangerous… You can’t see anything interesting at all for most of the time. […] At about 85% coverage I took a glance and once again did not see anything interesting tho the after shadow of the Sun in my retina […] was crescent shape! […] We waited… We noticed that the environment was getting colder […] It was also noticeable that it was getting darker […] When I noticed that it was at about 93%, I bumped my friends to look around and feel the moment: that was what Boston was experiencing, and that was the max of what it would experience. […] We were approaching Totality. […] 95% Nothing. 97% Nothing. 98% Nothing. Then, the last 20 seconds all happened at once. […] The Sun went from glaring to dark in a second, with the last glimpse of the Sun’s incredible brightness disappearing in a shinny dot of light in the edge of the disk of the Eclipse. […] If I […] wasn’t aware an Eclipse was happening, I would only notice something at the last 10-20 seconds. I understand why Solar Eclipses were regarded as mystical events for most of the history of humanity. […] Nothing can prepare someone to one of these. […] The sky was in a mix of night time with dawn and sunrise, but all directions of the horizon glowed. […] It was crisp, and it was impossible. […] Finally, with the Eclipse, I had a sensation that I very rarely had in my life. At times, when in a place where I was under a beautiful night sky, I could focus very hard on one thing and wait for a good 10-20-30 mins and notice that it has moved through the sky. In general, Celestial Objects move/change too slow for humans to dynamically notice. That is not the case in the Eclipse: in the moments surrounding second and third contacts you can see the brightness of the Sun suddenly changing. […] Here are some photos of that moment, as well as a video . […] Well, yeah I had an Astrophotography setup ⁠ 02 It was composed by a Celestron AstroMaster 114, a small Newtonian with 1000mm focal length, F/8.77 and 114mm aperture, in a manual equatorial mount (so no tracking). I had a solar filter placed on it and a Canon EOS Rebel T3i with an eyepiece adaptor that I borrowed (thank you Mike!) I was originally planning on using that cardboard made solar filter you can see in the photo in the left being used by Daina to look at the Sun. I got that borrowed by the Astrogazers at MIT and it is a few sizes bigger than my telescope in diameter, which ofc I was aware of. What I didn’t realize is that the fact the sizes don’t match would make it impossible for the inside of the filter+telescope system to be totally dark. So it didn’t work. Fortunately, Isaac had an extra filter that can be assembled to be placed in the lenses of a camera, and the cap of my telescope has a hole in the middle that I can open in case I want a smaller amount of light entering the telescope (for example, when looking at the Full Moon) and although Isaac’s extra filter was not big enough for the diameter of my telescope, it was bigger than the middle hole of my telescope cap. There was a concern on whether the structure that holds the secondary mirror would cause weird diffraction patterns if I use the central hole but fortunately it didn’t! for the Eclipse. […] Isaac’s setup was a bit more professional ⁠ 03 He didn’t put his camera on a telescope but he had a 300mm lenses in his camera, which was shooting automatically based on some software in his laptop, and his mount was a tracking mount. . […] Here are other things worth mentioning from yesterday: […] We were so lucky with the whole location thing. The lakeshore beach was gorgeous. […] I had a quintessential American experience yesterday: I had my first Lunchables. It was good! Or at least as good as it could be. The end That is all (I think?) […] Here’s a selfie of the crew of yesterday’s adventure. Sincerely, Oris Also, here’s the product of Isaac’s work: Allison ’27 When I was applying to colleges a year and a half ago, there were a lot of good reasons that I was excited about colleges in Boston, and one silly one: the 2024 solar eclipse would pass just north of the city. Four hours north, in fact. +1 pt. for MIT. And then I got in! A sign, perhaps, that I had to see it. So I made plans to tag along with a group of friends in ESP ⁠ 04 Educational Studies Program, a club I’m in that runs educational programs for middle and high schoolers to drive up to Vermont the day of the eclipse. We found just enough people to drive, and rented cars, and planned an itinerary, and raided Trader Joe’s for road trip snacks. There were three cars’ worth of people—for my sanity in explaining all this, let’s anthropomorphize them as Carter, Caroline, and Carina. Then, at 9 pm the night before April 8, the trials began: Carina’s driver had fallen sick, and couldn’t make the trip the next morning. This was unfortunate (especially for our driver, who was now both sick and unable to see the eclipse 😭), but after some deliberation, we decided to rent out a twelve-seater van (let’s name him Vance), and Carter’s driver would drive both the passengers of both Carina and Carter to Vermont. Very early in the morning, Carter’s driver and a valiant assistant embarked on their journey to the mystical land known as “the car rental place.” There they waited in line for our van. They waited. And they waited. And they waited some more, all for the poor, singular employee on the morning of the eclipse ⁠ 05 seriously, this poor employee 😭 to process a massive line of people impatient to set out before traffic. When the rest of our crew arrived at our designated pickup location (outside the Student Center) at 8:15 am sharp, they were still waiting. By the time the clock hit 9:00, we were worried, but luckily we’d found another driver! We therefore no longer really needed Vance, but unfortunately our attempts at getting access to Caroline fell through. In the wise words of one of our intrepid explorers, Fiona L. ‘27, ⁠ 06 Fiona would like you to know that she is the coolest person ever, and because she’s provided me with this wonderful framing device, I wholeheartedly endorse this message “everything that can go wrong, will go wrong ,” so we decided to rent yet another new car (Carlos) to make sure we could leave on time. In the meantime, Carter’s driver stuck it out in the original Vance line just a bit longer. When they finally got to the front of the line, however, the car rental place had no 12-seaters . In fact, they had no cars at all for us, despite our reservation. Luckily, we were prepared—“everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” Our two drivers met to pick up Carlos, and began driving back to campus for the rest of us. And then CARTER GOT A FLAT TIRE. I kid you not. At 9:42 am, Carter got a flat tire, and we were basically screwed. The Carter/Carlos crew worked quickly to switch to a spare, but they had to visit a repair shop before the four hour drive to Vermont. And then the first repair shop said they couldn’t fix it, so the crew had to move to a second. {Before I sent this blog to our group, I thought this shop was the one that fixed it. I have since been informed that it was not this one. Nor was it the third shop. It was, in fact, the fourth shop that could fix the tire 😭} They did the job relatively quickly, but by the time both cars made it back to campus to pick everyone up, it was 11:15 am. We had originally planned to leave at 8:15. “Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong .” But wait, there’s more! Totality would arrive in Vermont around 3:30 pm. Without traffic, the shortest drive to the path (headed to St. Johnsbury, VT) would be ~3 hours without any traffic. And it being the last total solar eclipse in the continental US for the next 20 years meant traffic . We weren’t sure if we could make it, but luckily traffic didn’t seem bad (except in a couple spots). We were staying on schedule. Life was looking good! Then I threw up… It was in a plastic bag, thank goodness, but um… that was not a fun experience, and it also meant we had to make a pit stop that delayed us even more . Sorry to Carlos and all his other passengers 😬. Despite this setback, however, we soldiered on. And somehow, miracle of miracles, we made it into the path of totality with 15 minutes to spare. We found the first available place to park, piled out of Carlos, and looked up at the sky (with eclipse glasses, of course). The color slowly leached out of our surroundings, the air got cooler, and then the sky went dark. Totality. I won’t put my pictures here, mainly because they literally just show a blob, but it was incredible. I learned about solar eclipses back in 8th grade, and we were told about these two phenomena—Baily’s Beads, where the sun shines through dips in the moon’s uneven surface to make little dots of sunlight, and the red light of the sun’s chromosphere, which is only visible during eclipses. Here’s a 2017 photo from the European Space Agency of what this look like up close, if you’re curious: I’d heard about them so many times, but I never thought they’d be visible from the naked eye—only from long exposures with professional cameras. And yet, looking up, there they were! Little dots of light and a distinct reddish outline around the edge of the sun. Our view of totality was very brief (about 30 seconds, because we barely made it into the path of totality), but it was fascinating nonetheless.  Even more than that, though, I really loved the reactions of everyone around us watching the eclipse together. We shared eclipse glasses in the lead-up, and you could hear the murmurs crescendo into shouts and clapping as totality fell. The shared energy of humans witnessing something exciting and otherworldly was honestly just as amazing as the eclipse itself. After seeing totality, we drove north to actually reach St. Johnsbury, and waited 35 minutes for a grocery store bathroom (bless them for having it open to the public). We started heading back to MIT around 5:00 pm, and after a couple shortcuts(?), we made it back at 10:30 pm. Not nearly as long as those who’d gone up to Newport (much further north and w/ more totality), but still quite long. Was the trip a bit of a hot mess? Comedically so. Was it worth it? Definitely. I may have fallen behind on schoolwork (carsickness kept me from doing anything en route), and almost everything that could go wrong might’ve gone wrong, but we saw the eclipse! Besides, in the words of one of my favorite bands, AJR, “A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories.” And this was one of the better ones! Amber ’24 B1 planned a trip that spanned three cars, eighteen people, and an egregious number of hours inching forward through traffic. We set out at 9am — we had plans for eight, but the line in front of Budget Rental Cars was far too long. I piled into a car of seniors: Gosha, Selena, Masha (Gosha’s friend), and Claire, the only other driver, who did so far more calmly than I did. The first three hours of driving went fine — or at least I think they did; I was asleep in the back seat. I took over around hour two. We kept passing speed traps. But as we neared New Hampshire, or Vermont, traffic slowed to a crawl. A literal crawl. For about three hours, it probably would have been faster to get out and walk. We’d planned to arrive at the path of totality around 2:30pm, one hour before the 1-3 minutes of totality. But traffic pushed that back. By 2:30, we were still 40 miles away and moving about 5 miles per hour. We discussed, and decided we’d pull over at 3:20, wherever we were. We didn’t expect to be where we wanted by totality. The eclipse started at 2:30, but the light didn’t change and the traffic didn’t slow until 3. When the light shifted, people started giving up on making the path of totality and pulled off to the side. All down the highway, cars pulled to the shoulder. People poured out and climbed on the hill. And then the highway was empty. I floored it. We raced through a light that was grey, different enough to notice, but subtle enough that on any other day I’d attribute it to an unfamiliar alignment of New England clouds, or simply to too much caffeine, and too little sleep. I pushed faster and faster. I felt the shift of gravity as we careened around curves, and the rush as I realized that one mistake would obliterate us. A few other cars were using me as coverage for speed traps and I let them pass, gave them enough distance that the highway was empty, just us and the dotted white lines blurring past. The light faded and everyone was waiting and I was making so many decisions, my foot on the gas, hurtling onward. I thought that even if we missed the totality this was how I wanted to experience the eclipse, driving so fast on empty roads. We pulled onto a side road at 3:26 and parked in a line of eclipse-viewers. The light was grey but unmistakeably day time. We approached the car next to us and asked, “Are we in totality? And do you have extra glasses?” “Yes, and yes,” answered a man in his mid-twenties, with close-cut brownish hair and a patterned button-down, the quintessential Bostonian professional. He gave us extra glasses; we’d left ours in one of the other B1 cars. “I drove five hours to be right here. It better be right.” We stepped away and disappeared into our glasses. Through them, the sun barely peeked out from behind the moon. Then the moon moved up, and the sun was just a corona. The eclipse itself was magical. It was light at first in totality, then dark, like night falling all at once. It looked like true night. It was cold, and the sun behind the moon was beautiful. I understood how one could look at this and say that they had stronger gods. There was dead quiet on the highway, except for one car rushing back the way we’d come. He has no wonder, we said. The quiet enhanced the magic, as if the whole world stopped for this. And then it was ending. The sun peeked out, and the dim light returned. The shadows in the crags of the rocks were so deep. For the next hour I kept looking at the landscape, trying to judge, between the adrenaline in my body and my headache and the eclipse, how real the light was, how smoky or grey. I’m glad I saw the eclipse. I’m glad we did. That was insane all of it. Ali ’26 how strange it is to be anything at all I had lots of dreams as a kid. In particular, I had a bunch of pretty outlandish ones, like getting absurdly rich by starting a company, time travel to the year 3000, live to see myself graduate high school, and also, see a total solar eclipse. The internet told me, however, that the last dream was futile: the next eclipse—well, the next eclipse in the US at least, I didn’t really think about anywhere else—was hundreds of miles away from where I grew up. So, the eclipse dream got shelved like the others, and I became a worldly, serious woman without such silly aspirations. My kid self didn’t realize that by the year 2024 I would be in college and mostly have the ability to go wherever I wanted. The other thing I didn’t know was that, by pure coincidence, my family would have moved across the country to Rochester, NY—which happens to be located within that tiny sliver of totality. So, four of my friends and I crashed at my house for the weekend. We got wet on the Maid of the Mist under Niagara Falls, watched Poor Things in my living room (that one might’ve been a mistake), and we also got to see the rarest of astronomical events: the total solar eclipse, located at a sweet 12-minute walk from my house. Here is my favorite eclipse fact: most of the eclipses that will ever happen are in the past. When the moon first formed, back when the earth was young and hot and hellish, it was three times as close as it is now. It looked about three times as big as it does today. Eclipses were probably… around nine times more frequent? Over the billions of years since, the moon has slowly come to its position today, as each year the moon moves an inch and a half away. And within the next billion years, the moon will be so small that it can no longer cover the sun at all. That will be the last eclipse; we are nearly almost there. The margin is so small now that the moon is sometimes bigger than the sun, and sometimes smaller, depending on where it is in its orbit. It is coincidence beyond coincidence that there are even eclipses at all. And also , within the next billion years, macroscopic life on Earth will end. The sun will grow ten percent brighter; the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will decrease, killing the plants and presumably all the animals with them. Then the surface temperature will rise to over a hundred degrees, cooking everything in existence. And so, most life on Earth that will ever live has probably already lived. To start with, though, life too was a coincidence beyond coincidence. The complexity of even the humblest cell is tremendous. And the fact that those single cells came together to think, to realize itself, to discover itself: that seems even less believable. Some think that the moon was responsible for us: that the flow and ebb, the push and pull of those early tide pools was the cradle of first life. And so maybe there is a deeper link between these two coincidences. Or maybe there isn’t; trying to predict what happened millions of years ago or what will happen millions of years from now is maybe no more than just science men’s tea-leaf reading. Those were the things I was thinking about, while we were sprawled out on the lawn, waiting for the eclipse to happen. Well, there ended up being just one more coincidence: the clouds were in perfect position to block out the sky completely during the eclipse. Our hard-won eclipse glasses were useless. We grumbled under the overcast sky. Other than an increasing chill, no change was visible at all until maybe five minutes before the eclipse. Then the sky seemed to grow a few shades darker every minute; nothing happened for a few seconds, I looked away, I looked back, the sky was darker again, and then suddenly the sky darkened completely, like God had finished playing with us and finally flipped his light switch. Thanks to the clouds, no sun was visible; no corona; no Baily’s beads; but the sky was a dark turquoise, the clouds glowed a vomit orange. Streetlamps turned on; dogs barked. It felt unnatural and eerie, like the earth had gotten terribly sick. And as soon as it happened, it was over. The sky began to pale, and soon enough, it was overcast again, as if nothing had happened. I’d taken my coat off to feel the authentic chill of the eclipse; I put it back on. And on the walk back, I told my mom that this all meant we were fated to see another eclipse in the rest of our short lives—one where the sky was clear, where not a single cloud would be in the sky, and everything worked out just the way it was meant to be. Title from In the Aeroplane Over the Sea—Neutral Milk Hotel Facts sourced from Wikipedia Audrey ’24 the real eclipse was the friends we made along the way I chased totality with friends from my living group/frat t𝜩p. We left Boston the day before to camp out in the Green Mountains in northern Vermont. As the designated “food car,” getting everything — a lot of food, a mini grill, camping equipment, personal bags, — was a game of Tetris. Grace drove, and Winnie navigated. Ilani, Terrin, and I got to turn off our brains as the backseat crew. But, I would like to think that we pulled our weight by hugging all the stuff that couldn’t fit in the trunk. like no leg room whatsoever After five hours of losing feeling in my butt and being neck deep in stuff (which I would honestly still prefer over driving), we found a place to camp right before sunset. Grace explained that we were dispersive camping, which is when you camp outside an actual campground and therefore don’t need to pay fees. A thin layer of snow blanketed the ground, twinkling slightly in the fading light of the day. It was beautiful until we realized that it made keeping dry (and by extension, not getting hypothermia) harder. One could say that we were unprepared for dispersive camping in the snow, but one could also say that we were resourceful. Using the mini grill’s lid as a shovel, we cleared out two rectangles of snow to pitch our tents. We remembered to bring charcoal briquettes for the grill, but not lighter fluid. Winnie came in clutch with the bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol that she usually keeps in her backpack for cleaning circuit boards, which surprisingly got the grill going strong enough to grill a whole fish. By then, night had fallen. We realized in the pitch black darkness that we had two headlamps for five people. But that was enough light to see that our fish was (mostly) cooked through. We dug in. “Woah what’s the goopy stuff?” “Guts.” “Oof it tastes good.” Isn’t it wild that an ungutted fish would come with guts? It helped that Ilani thought that the fish guts had the most flavor, such that we ate pretty much every part of the fish save for the bones. Sharing a whole fish was a very familial ritual for me, as my mom would pick out the bit under the cheek as the most tender part of the fish for me to enjoy. This time, I got to be the one to pick out the cheek bit for others. I have only been able to gaze at a night sky untouched by light pollution a few times in my life. When we turned off our headlamps, it felt as if we were enveloped by an infinite black cloak. The temperature had dropped below freezing, but I forgot about that just for a bit. The woods, the mountains, and the sky melted into one endless expanse. Once my eyes adjusted, I still could only barely make out the silhouettes of trees faintly illuminated by starlight. I knew the Big Dipper and Orion, and then Grace pointed out the Little Dipper so I guess I now know that one too. the big dipper :) I thought it was a firefly at first, by the way its glow darted from one corner of the sky to another. Then I realized, it was a shooting star!! I’ve seen them once before in the White Mountains a few summers ago, and I just saw my second one in the Green Mountains. Sometimes I forget that shooting stars are real. Meteors are just like the rest of us, in a hurry to get from one place to another. I’m just glad that amongst all of the possible trajectories it could’ve taken through space, it crossed mine for a brief moment. ✨✨✨ We woke up bright and early to stuff in another hot meal, courtesy of Winnie’s grillmaster skills, and to hit the roads for Peru, a rural town in upstate New York that happened to be in the dead center of the totality path. A t𝜩p alum’s uncle owns a farmhouse there and kindly let several groups of t𝜩p alumni come over for eclipse festivities. I loved telling people that I was chasing totality in Peru without mentioning the upstate New York part. There should’ve been two more cars of undergrad t𝜩ps to meet up with us at Peru. But noooo, they decided that the forecasted 40% cloud cover in upstate NY was too high for them and veered off towards northern Vermont instead. (Did they not consider that they just ditched the food car??) Our car talked it over, ultimately deciding that hanging out with alumni was a big part of this trip and forging ahead with what we had planned. Farmhouse in Peru, NY We frolicked in the farmland, caught the alums up with current t𝜩p matters, grilled potatoes, and accidentally burned potatoes down to charcoal. Someone had a fancy telescope setup whose resolution allowed you to see sunspots freckling the brilliant orange surface of the sun. I borrowed glasses to peer at the shrinking sliver of sun once in a while. But really I was most happy to be touching grass out in the middle of nowhere and taking in the warmth of the sun after sleeping outside in below freezing conditions… Until it suddenly got chilly. The birds must’ve felt it too, taking flight in all directions. When the sun slipped behind the moon, a collective woah fell across the group. I felt many of the same things as I did the night before gazing at the stars. But at this moment, when the sky quickly fell into a velvety shade of dark cobalt, I was also reminded of one of my favorite novel scenes: “It’s just incredible. I can’t believe you’ve given me the sky to sleep under. But I can’t tell if it’s dawn or dusk you’ve painted.” She smiled up at the ceiling. “It’s neither. It’s both. Does that unnerve you?” from Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg It was dusk. It was dawn. It was neither, it was both in the most beautiful of ways. We were simultaneously nothing compared to the celestial bodies that just aligned and and in that moment I swear we were infinite. ⁠ 07 from <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower </em>by Stephen Chbosky I’m not sure if I’ve already written about this here, but I find the insignificance of my being to be more comforting than unnerving, as it means I can create significance in whatever way I choose. I tried to think about what this eclipse meant in terms of higher beings and such, but at the end of the day, the fact that I could witness all this alongside my friends bore the most significance to me. grace and ilani right before totality grace and ilani during totality sungazing setup An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Also cloud cover had nothing on us. :) stolen from winnie because her photo was better than mine 🌘🌘🌘 We packed up the car as soon as dusk-dawn gave way to day. The birds went on their merry way and so did we. Rural upstate New York wasn’t too bad in terms of traffic, but we immediately hit a standstill upon crossing the border to Vermont. There was a bar/inn/convenience store (I’m not sure which one) on the side of the highway, whose owner took us gridlocked townies as a business opportunity. “VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP!!!! JUST [X] DOLLARS A GALLON!!!!” “SORRY NEXT TIME!!!” we yelled back through our windows. Inching through traffic allowed us to take in the local scenery, which often included cows. What did the cow say to the eclipse traffic? MOOOOOOOOOVE It was quite obvious that the trip back would take way longer than the 5 hours it took to get there, but the question became how long. Google maps claimed there to be no traffic on the main highway we were crawling through, but the unending centipede of taillights stretching before us begged to differ. Right… there was no cell service in the middle of the Green Mountains, and Google maps pulls traffic data from people’s cell phones. meme courtesy of winnie Grace called her mom for advice on how to avoid crawling through the next 200 miles in gridlock. We could keep following Google maps, but that’s what most people are going to do. It’s worth at least checking out the back roads if they’re any better, and lo and behold they were! Again Grace pulled through with the insane driving stamina, Winnie with the navigation, and Terrin, Ilani and I with the backseat cheer crew. The drive back took 7-8 hours including rest stops, which was considered speedy compared to what I’ve heard. ☀️☀️☀️ That was a lot. I gazed at the stars, I witnessed the flight of a meteor, and I beheld the alignment of the moon and the sun against the most brilliant of dusk-dawns. I am so so glad to have chased totality, and so so thankful for the people who I went with.

'24 Audrey C. '24 Course 6-9 [email protected] Biography Hi I’m Audrey and a fun fact about me is that I’m blocked by a cult on Facebook. I’m from California, where green grass is usually fake and real grass is usually yellow. One of my favorite things about Boston and New England in general is the sheer abundance of real green grass. In my humble opinion, touching grass is one of the best things that someone can do for themselves, unless you’re allergic. I came into MIT thinking that I’ll spend the bulk of my days sitting on my butt coding, but I soon discovered the joy of makerspaces! There’s a certain magic to tinkering with tools and watching your ideas materialize into actual things that you can see and touch. After a few change of majors forms, I’ve settled into majoring in 6-9 (Computation & Cognition) and minoring in 2 (MechE). When I’m not getting blocked by cults or touching grass or accidentally welding my workpiece to the table, I’m pretending to be a firebender. Thank goodness MIT Spinning Arts exists as a venue for non-bending normies like me to wave around props of fire and light. I take great pride in teaching other non-bending normies how to set things on fire SAFELY. That’s all for now! Thanks for reading! Flameo Hotman!

'24 compilation post by Kano '25, Allison '27, Amber '24, Ali '26, & Audrey '24 April 22, 2024 in Events , How to Human , People & Identities , Personal Travel This post is very very delayed, for which I plead procrastination on my part :(. The Great North American Eclipse happened on April 8th, 2024, but better posted late than never! Here are several bloggers’ eclipse chasing tales dumped into a compilation blog: Kano Allison Amber Ali Audrey Kano ’25 I felt profoundly small. The world was changing right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do about it. At first, it felt like nothing was happening but, then, the entire landscape transformed. The moment was ephemeral. For totality, the difference between 99% and 100% felt far beyond between 0% and 99%. My eyes began to well, and I couldn’t have prepared myself for the stir of emotions that suddenly flooded me: awe, joy, confusion, denial, and horror. The world shifted for a moment and, slowly but surely, it faded back into what was, as if nothing had happened. I thought about the rise and fall of the sun. Every day, we have a peaceful dawn and an idyllic sundown, yet they seem to mostly exist in the background of our lives. If sunrises and sunsets occurred more rarely, perhaps we would take a longer look at them. Scarcity breeds demand or whatever. In that same vein, if total eclipses occurred daily, would my friends and I have woken up at 4:00 am to drive for 4 hours to the tippity top of Vermont and 10 hours back to arrive back home on a school night at 3:00 am the following day? I planned most of the trip in our Notion page . Here’s the first part of it: Also made a fitting playlist: We had a good crew. I planned the trip. Daina N. ‘25 drove mostly in the city and is an EAPS major, ⁠ 01 Earth, Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences a.k.a. big Earth nerd. Isaac L. ‘25 drove mostly out of the city and is an astrophotographer. Caitlin O. ‘25 was our backup-turned-main driver. Oris S. N. ‘23 is a massive astrophysics nerd in every way and detailed our adventure in an email he sent out to some friends. I forwarded that email over to some of my friends. Here are some excerpts: we did it :) also, i find it cute that the last two trips i went on match up with lyrics from You’re So Vain by Carly Simon (excellent cheeky fun song): Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia To see the total eclipse of the sun ———- Forwarded message ——— From: Oris Date: Tue, Apr 9, 2024 at 8:16 PM Subject: Re: Eclipse of April 8th, 2024 To: oris_pals Hi all, Yesterday, as everyone probably is aware, was a Solar Eclipse day. […] Here is my adventure: creatures of dawn […] We had originally planned to go to St Albans City in Vermont but, early on the way we then decided to go to Newport, VT, given some discouraging changes in St Albans weather forecast. We arrived at Newport at ~8:30am, so we had hours and hours of spare time before the Eclipse started. Yay! viewing location Kano and Daina […] found a small lakeshore beach, the Prouty Beach at Boston Park (yes we went from Boston to Boston haha), that had an spectacularly unobstructed view of the sky. […] After setting my equipment there and testing polar alignment and sun photos, Kano[, Caitlin, and I] went for a stroll in the town. Newport is a lovely town and it was definitely not made to have as many people as it had yesterday lol. […] first contact At 2:16pm EST, April 8th 2024, the spectacle started. […] The totality was predicted for 15:27:07 of where we were. I had my laptop open, monitoring Stellarium the whole time so I could keep track of coverage levels. Every 10 mins I would take a photo of the Sun: After I got that last photo, I had a plan: I’d wait for the totality start, fully experiencing that with no distractions of cameras or telescope, and I’d let myself be on that state for 30s in totality, when then I’d snap back to take a photo of it and once I was satisfied, go back to the experiencing it with no distractions so I could see it end. […] Now, I’m not proud of it, but I did glance at the Sun without my glasses a few times (please NEVER do that, I was being stupid). […] Some takeaways from these small experiences: DON’T DO IT it is dangerous… You can’t see anything interesting at all for most of the time. […] At about 85% coverage I took a glance and once again did not see anything interesting tho the after shadow of the Sun in my retina […] was crescent shape! […] We waited… We noticed that the environment was getting colder […] It was also noticeable that it was getting darker […] When I noticed that it was at about 93%, I bumped my friends to look around and feel the moment: that was what Boston was experiencing, and that was the max of what it would experience. […] We were approaching Totality. […] 95% Nothing. 97% Nothing. 98% Nothing. Then, the last 20 seconds all happened at once. […] The Sun went from glaring to dark in a second, with the last glimpse of the Sun’s incredible brightness disappearing in a shinny dot of light in the edge of the disk of the Eclipse. […] If I […] wasn’t aware an Eclipse was happening, I would only notice something at the last 10-20 seconds. I understand why Solar Eclipses were regarded as mystical events for most of the history of humanity. […] Nothing can prepare someone to one of these. […] The sky was in a mix of night time with dawn and sunrise, but all directions of the horizon glowed. […] It was crisp, and it was impossible. […] Finally, with the Eclipse, I had a sensation that I very rarely had in my life. At times, when in a place where I was under a beautiful night sky, I could focus very hard on one thing and wait for a good 10-20-30 mins and notice that it has moved through the sky. In general, Celestial Objects move/change too slow for humans to dynamically notice. That is not the case in the Eclipse: in the moments surrounding second and third contacts you can see the brightness of the Sun suddenly changing. […] Here are some photos of that moment, as well as a video . […] Well, yeah I had an Astrophotography setup ⁠ 02 It was composed by a Celestron AstroMaster 114, a small Newtonian with 1000mm focal length, F/8.77 and 114mm aperture, in a manual equatorial mount (so no tracking). I had a solar filter placed on it and a Canon EOS Rebel T3i with an eyepiece adaptor that I borrowed (thank you Mike!) I was originally planning on using that cardboard made solar filter you can see in the photo in the left being used by Daina to look at the Sun. I got that borrowed by the Astrogazers at MIT and it is a few sizes bigger than my telescope in diameter, which ofc I was aware of. What I didn’t realize is that the fact the sizes don’t match would make it impossible for the inside of the filter+telescope system to be totally dark. So it didn’t work. Fortunately, Isaac had an extra filter that can be assembled to be placed in the lenses of a camera, and the cap of my telescope has a hole in the middle that I can open in case I want a smaller amount of light entering the telescope (for example, when looking at the Full Moon) and although Isaac’s extra filter was not big enough for the diameter of my telescope, it was bigger than the middle hole of my telescope cap. There was a concern on whether the structure that holds the secondary mirror would cause weird diffraction patterns if I use the central hole but fortunately it didn’t! for the Eclipse. […] Isaac’s setup was a bit more professional ⁠ 03 He didn’t put his camera on a telescope but he had a 300mm lenses in his camera, which was shooting automatically based on some software in his laptop, and his mount was a tracking mount. . […] Here are other things worth mentioning from yesterday: […] We were so lucky with the whole location thing. The lakeshore beach was gorgeous. […] I had a quintessential American experience yesterday: I had my first Lunchables. It was good! Or at least as good as it could be. The end That is all (I think?) […] Here’s a selfie of the crew of yesterday’s adventure. Sincerely, Oris Also, here’s the product of Isaac’s work: Allison ’27 When I was applying to colleges a year and a half ago, there were a lot of good reasons that I was excited about colleges in Boston, and one silly one: the 2024 solar eclipse would pass just north of the city. Four hours north, in fact. +1 pt. for MIT. And then I got in! A sign, perhaps, that I had to see it. So I made plans to tag along with a group of friends in ESP ⁠ 04 Educational Studies Program, a club I’m in that runs educational programs for middle and high schoolers to drive up to Vermont the day of the eclipse. We found just enough people to drive, and rented cars, and planned an itinerary, and raided Trader Joe’s for road trip snacks. There were three cars’ worth of people—for my sanity in explaining all this, let’s anthropomorphize them as Carter, Caroline, and Carina. Then, at 9 pm the night before April 8, the trials began: Carina’s driver had fallen sick, and couldn’t make the trip the next morning. This was unfortunate (especially for our driver, who was now both sick and unable to see the eclipse 😭), but after some deliberation, we decided to rent out a twelve-seater van (let’s name him Vance), and Carter’s driver would drive both the passengers of both Carina and Carter to Vermont. Very early in the morning, Carter’s driver and a valiant assistant embarked on their journey to the mystical land known as “the car rental place.” There they waited in line for our van. They waited. And they waited. And they waited some more, all for the poor, singular employee on the morning of the eclipse ⁠ 05 seriously, this poor employee 😭 to process a massive line of people impatient to set out before traffic. When the rest of our crew arrived at our designated pickup location (outside the Student Center) at 8:15 am sharp, they were still waiting. By the time the clock hit 9:00, we were worried, but luckily we’d found another driver! We therefore no longer really needed Vance, but unfortunately our attempts at getting access to Caroline fell through. In the wise words of one of our intrepid explorers, Fiona L. ‘27, ⁠ 06 Fiona would like you to know that she is the coolest person ever, and because she’s provided me with this wonderful framing device, I wholeheartedly endorse this message “everything that can go wrong, will go wrong ,” so we decided to rent yet another new car (Carlos) to make sure we could leave on time. In the meantime, Carter’s driver stuck it out in the original Vance line just a bit longer. When they finally got to the front of the line, however, the car rental place had no 12-seaters . In fact, they had no cars at all for us, despite our reservation. Luckily, we were prepared—“everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” Our two drivers met to pick up Carlos, and began driving back to campus for the rest of us. And then CARTER GOT A FLAT TIRE. I kid you not. At 9:42 am, Carter got a flat tire, and we were basically screwed. The Carter/Carlos crew worked quickly to switch to a spare, but they had to visit a repair shop before the four hour drive to Vermont. And then the first repair shop said they couldn’t fix it, so the crew had to move to a second. {Before I sent this blog to our group, I thought this shop was the one that fixed it. I have since been informed that it was not this one. Nor was it the third shop. It was, in fact, the fourth shop that could fix the tire 😭} They did the job relatively quickly, but by the time both cars made it back to campus to pick everyone up, it was 11:15 am. We had originally planned to leave at 8:15. “Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong .” But wait, there’s more! Totality would arrive in Vermont around 3:30 pm. Without traffic, the shortest drive to the path (headed to St. Johnsbury, VT) would be ~3 hours without any traffic. And it being the last total solar eclipse in the continental US for the next 20 years meant traffic . We weren’t sure if we could make it, but luckily traffic didn’t seem bad (except in a couple spots). We were staying on schedule. Life was looking good! Then I threw up… It was in a plastic bag, thank goodness, but um… that was not a fun experience, and it also meant we had to make a pit stop that delayed us even more . Sorry to Carlos and all his other passengers 😬. Despite this setback, however, we soldiered on. And somehow, miracle of miracles, we made it into the path of totality with 15 minutes to spare. We found the first available place to park, piled out of Carlos, and looked up at the sky (with eclipse glasses, of course). The color slowly leached out of our surroundings, the air got cooler, and then the sky went dark. Totality. I won’t put my pictures here, mainly because they literally just show a blob, but it was incredible. I learned about solar eclipses back in 8th grade, and we were told about these two phenomena—Baily’s Beads, where the sun shines through dips in the moon’s uneven surface to make little dots of sunlight, and the red light of the sun’s chromosphere, which is only visible during eclipses. Here’s a 2017 photo from the European Space Agency of what this look like up close, if you’re curious: I’d heard about them so many times, but I never thought they’d be visible from the naked eye—only from long exposures with professional cameras. And yet, looking up, there they were! Little dots of light and a distinct reddish outline around the edge of the sun. Our view of totality was very brief (about 30 seconds, because we barely made it into the path of totality), but it was fascinating nonetheless.  Even more than that, though, I really loved the reactions of everyone around us watching the eclipse together. We shared eclipse glasses in the lead-up, and you could hear the murmurs crescendo into shouts and clapping as totality fell. The shared energy of humans witnessing something exciting and otherworldly was honestly just as amazing as the eclipse itself. After seeing totality, we drove north to actually reach St. Johnsbury, and waited 35 minutes for a grocery store bathroom (bless them for having it open to the public). We started heading back to MIT around 5:00 pm, and after a couple shortcuts(?), we made it back at 10:30 pm. Not nearly as long as those who’d gone up to Newport (much further north and w/ more totality), but still quite long. Was the trip a bit of a hot mess? Comedically so. Was it worth it? Definitely. I may have fallen behind on schoolwork (carsickness kept me from doing anything en route), and almost everything that could go wrong might’ve gone wrong, but we saw the eclipse! Besides, in the words of one of my favorite bands, AJR, “A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories.” And this was one of the better ones! Amber ’24 B1 planned a trip that spanned three cars, eighteen people, and an egregious number of hours inching forward through traffic. We set out at 9am — we had plans for eight, but the line in front of Budget Rental Cars was far too long. I piled into a car of seniors: Gosha, Selena, Masha (Gosha’s friend), and Claire, the only other driver, who did so far more calmly than I did. The first three hours of driving went fine — or at least I think they did; I was asleep in the back seat. I took over around hour two. We kept passing speed traps. But as we neared New Hampshire, or Vermont, traffic slowed to a crawl. A literal crawl. For about three hours, it probably would have been faster to get out and walk. We’d planned to arrive at the path of totality around 2:30pm, one hour before the 1-3 minutes of totality. But traffic pushed that back. By 2:30, we were still 40 miles away and moving about 5 miles per hour. We discussed, and decided we’d pull over at 3:20, wherever we were. We didn’t expect to be where we wanted by totality. The eclipse started at 2:30, but the light didn’t change and the traffic didn’t slow until 3. When the light shifted, people started giving up on making the path of totality and pulled off to the side. All down the highway, cars pulled to the shoulder. People poured out and climbed on the hill. And then the highway was empty. I floored it. We raced through a light that was grey, different enough to notice, but subtle enough that on any other day I’d attribute it to an unfamiliar alignment of New England clouds, or simply to too much caffeine, and too little sleep. I pushed faster and faster. I felt the shift of gravity as we careened around curves, and the rush as I realized that one mistake would obliterate us. A few other cars were using me as coverage for speed traps and I let them pass, gave them enough distance that the highway was empty, just us and the dotted white lines blurring past. The light faded and everyone was waiting and I was making so many decisions, my foot on the gas, hurtling onward. I thought that even if we missed the totality this was how I wanted to experience the eclipse, driving so fast on empty roads. We pulled onto a side road at 3:26 and parked in a line of eclipse-viewers. The light was grey but unmistakeably day time. We approached the car next to us and asked, “Are we in totality? And do you have extra glasses?” “Yes, and yes,” answered a man in his mid-twenties, with close-cut brownish hair and a patterned button-down, the quintessential Bostonian professional. He gave us extra glasses; we’d left ours in one of the other B1 cars. “I drove five hours to be right here. It better be right.” We stepped away and disappeared into our glasses. Through them, the sun barely peeked out from behind the moon. Then the moon moved up, and the sun was just a corona. The eclipse itself was magical. It was light at first in totality, then dark, like night falling all at once. It looked like true night. It was cold, and the sun behind the moon was beautiful. I understood how one could look at this and say that they had stronger gods. There was dead quiet on the highway, except for one car rushing back the way we’d come. He has no wonder, we said. The quiet enhanced the magic, as if the whole world stopped for this. And then it was ending. The sun peeked out, and the dim light returned. The shadows in the crags of the rocks were so deep. For the next hour I kept looking at the landscape, trying to judge, between the adrenaline in my body and my headache and the eclipse, how real the light was, how smoky or grey. I’m glad I saw the eclipse. I’m glad we did. That was insane all of it. Ali ’26 how strange it is to be anything at all I had lots of dreams as a kid. In particular, I had a bunch of pretty outlandish ones, like getting absurdly rich by starting a company, time travel to the year 3000, live to see myself graduate high school, and also, see a total solar eclipse. The internet told me, however, that the last dream was futile: the next eclipse—well, the next eclipse in the US at least, I didn’t really think about anywhere else—was hundreds of miles away from where I grew up. So, the eclipse dream got shelved like the others, and I became a worldly, serious woman without such silly aspirations. My kid self didn’t realize that by the year 2024 I would be in college and mostly have the ability to go wherever I wanted. The other thing I didn’t know was that, by pure coincidence, my family would have moved across the country to Rochester, NY—which happens to be located within that tiny sliver of totality. So, four of my friends and I crashed at my house for the weekend. We got wet on the Maid of the Mist under Niagara Falls, watched Poor Things in my living room (that one might’ve been a mistake), and we also got to see the rarest of astronomical events: the total solar eclipse, located at a sweet 12-minute walk from my house. Here is my favorite eclipse fact: most of the eclipses that will ever happen are in the past. When the moon first formed, back when the earth was young and hot and hellish, it was three times as close as it is now. It looked about three times as big as it does today. Eclipses were probably… around nine times more frequent? Over the billions of years since, the moon has slowly come to its position today, as each year the moon moves an inch and a half away. And within the next billion years, the moon will be so small that it can no longer cover the sun at all. That will be the last eclipse; we are nearly almost there. The margin is so small now that the moon is sometimes bigger than the sun, and sometimes smaller, depending on where it is in its orbit. It is coincidence beyond coincidence that there are even eclipses at all. And also , within the next billion years, macroscopic life on Earth will end. The sun will grow ten percent brighter; the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will decrease, killing the plants and presumably all the animals with them. Then the surface temperature will rise to over a hundred degrees, cooking everything in existence. And so, most life on Earth that will ever live has probably already lived. To start with, though, life too was a coincidence beyond coincidence. The complexity of even the humblest cell is tremendous. And the fact that those single cells came together to think, to realize itself, to discover itself: that seems even less believable. Some think that the moon was responsible for us: that the flow and ebb, the push and pull of those early tide pools was the cradle of first life. And so maybe there is a deeper link between these two coincidences. Or maybe there isn’t; trying to predict what happened millions of years ago or what will happen millions of years from now is maybe no more than just science men’s tea-leaf reading. Those were the things I was thinking about, while we were sprawled out on the lawn, waiting for the eclipse to happen. Well, there ended up being just one more coincidence: the clouds were in perfect position to block out the sky completely during the eclipse. Our hard-won eclipse glasses were useless. We grumbled under the overcast sky. Other than an increasing chill, no change was visible at all until maybe five minutes before the eclipse. Then the sky seemed to grow a few shades darker every minute; nothing happened for a few seconds, I looked away, I looked back, the sky was darker again, and then suddenly the sky darkened completely, like God had finished playing with us and finally flipped his light switch. Thanks to the clouds, no sun was visible; no corona; no Baily’s beads; but the sky was a dark turquoise, the clouds glowed a vomit orange. Streetlamps turned on; dogs barked. It felt unnatural and eerie, like the earth had gotten terribly sick. And as soon as it happened, it was over. The sky began to pale, and soon enough, it was overcast again, as if nothing had happened. I’d taken my coat off to feel the authentic chill of the eclipse; I put it back on. And on the walk back, I told my mom that this all meant we were fated to see another eclipse in the rest of our short lives—one where the sky was clear, where not a single cloud would be in the sky, and everything worked out just the way it was meant to be. Title from In the Aeroplane Over the Sea—Neutral Milk Hotel Facts sourced from Wikipedia Audrey ’24 the real eclipse was the friends we made along the way I chased totality with friends from my living group/frat t𝜩p. We left Boston the day before to camp out in the Green Mountains in northern Vermont. As the designated “food car,” getting everything — a lot of food, a mini grill, camping equipment, personal bags, — was a game of Tetris. Grace drove, and Winnie navigated. Ilani, Terrin, and I got to turn off our brains as the backseat crew. But, I would like to think that we pulled our weight by hugging all the stuff that couldn’t fit in the trunk. like no leg room whatsoever After five hours of losing feeling in my butt and being neck deep in stuff (which I would honestly still prefer over driving), we found a place to camp right before sunset. Grace explained that we were dispersive camping, which is when you camp outside an actual campground and therefore don’t need to pay fees. A thin layer of snow blanketed the ground, twinkling slightly in the fading light of the day. It was beautiful until we realized that it made keeping dry (and by extension, not getting hypothermia) harder. One could say that we were unprepared for dispersive camping in the snow, but one could also say that we were resourceful. Using the mini grill’s lid as a shovel, we cleared out two rectangles of snow to pitch our tents. We remembered to bring charcoal briquettes for the grill, but not lighter fluid. Winnie came in clutch with the bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol that she usually keeps in her backpack for cleaning circuit boards, which surprisingly got the grill going strong enough to grill a whole fish. By then, night had fallen. We realized in the pitch black darkness that we had two headlamps for five people. But that was enough light to see that our fish was (mostly) cooked through. We dug in. “Woah what’s the goopy stuff?” “Guts.” “Oof it tastes good.” Isn’t it wild that an ungutted fish would come with guts? It helped that Ilani thought that the fish guts had the most flavor, such that we ate pretty much every part of the fish save for the bones. Sharing a whole fish was a very familial ritual for me, as my mom would pick out the bit under the cheek as the most tender part of the fish for me to enjoy. This time, I got to be the one to pick out the cheek bit for others. I have only been able to gaze at a night sky untouched by light pollution a few times in my life. When we turned off our headlamps, it felt as if we were enveloped by an infinite black cloak. The temperature had dropped below freezing, but I forgot about that just for a bit. The woods, the mountains, and the sky melted into one endless expanse. Once my eyes adjusted, I still could only barely make out the silhouettes of trees faintly illuminated by starlight. I knew the Big Dipper and Orion, and then Grace pointed out the Little Dipper so I guess I now know that one too. the big dipper :) I thought it was a firefly at first, by the way its glow darted from one corner of the sky to another. Then I realized, it was a shooting star!! I’ve seen them once before in the White Mountains a few summers ago, and I just saw my second one in the Green Mountains. Sometimes I forget that shooting stars are real. Meteors are just like the rest of us, in a hurry to get from one place to another. I’m just glad that amongst all of the possible trajectories it could’ve taken through space, it crossed mine for a brief moment. ✨✨✨ We woke up bright and early to stuff in another hot meal, courtesy of Winnie’s grillmaster skills, and to hit the roads for Peru, a rural town in upstate New York that happened to be in the dead center of the totality path. A t𝜩p alum’s uncle owns a farmhouse there and kindly let several groups of t𝜩p alumni come over for eclipse festivities. I loved telling people that I was chasing totality in Peru without mentioning the upstate New York part. There should’ve been two more cars of undergrad t𝜩ps to meet up with us at Peru. But noooo, they decided that the forecasted 40% cloud cover in upstate NY was too high for them and veered off towards northern Vermont instead. (Did they not consider that they just ditched the food car??) Our car talked it over, ultimately deciding that hanging out with alumni was a big part of this trip and forging ahead with what we had planned. Farmhouse in Peru, NY We frolicked in the farmland, caught the alums up with current t𝜩p matters, grilled potatoes, and accidentally burned potatoes down to charcoal. Someone had a fancy telescope setup whose resolution allowed you to see sunspots freckling the brilliant orange surface of the sun. I borrowed glasses to peer at the shrinking sliver of sun once in a while. But really I was most happy to be touching grass out in the middle of nowhere and taking in the warmth of the sun after sleeping outside in below freezing conditions… Until it suddenly got chilly. The birds must’ve felt it too, taking flight in all directions. When the sun slipped behind the moon, a collective woah fell across the group. I felt many of the same things as I did the night before gazing at the stars. But at this moment, when the sky quickly fell into a velvety shade of dark cobalt, I was also reminded of one of my favorite novel scenes: “It’s just incredible. I can’t believe you’ve given me the sky to sleep under. But I can’t tell if it’s dawn or dusk you’ve painted.” She smiled up at the ceiling. “It’s neither. It’s both. Does that unnerve you?” from Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg It was dusk. It was dawn. It was neither, it was both in the most beautiful of ways. We were simultaneously nothing compared to the celestial bodies that just aligned and and in that moment I swear we were infinite. ⁠ 07 from <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower </em>by Stephen Chbosky I’m not sure if I’ve already written about this here, but I find the insignificance of my being to be more comforting than unnerving, as it means I can create significance in whatever way I choose. I tried to think about what this eclipse meant in terms of higher beings and such, but at the end of the day, the fact that I could witness all this alongside my friends bore the most significance to me. grace and ilani right before totality grace and ilani during totality sungazing setup An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Also cloud cover had nothing on us. :) stolen from winnie because her photo was better than mine 🌘🌘🌘 We packed up the car as soon as dusk-dawn gave way to day. The birds went on their merry way and so did we. Rural upstate New York wasn’t too bad in terms of traffic, but we immediately hit a standstill upon crossing the border to Vermont. There was a bar/inn/convenience store (I’m not sure which one) on the side of the highway, whose owner took us gridlocked townies as a business opportunity. “VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP!!!! JUST [X] DOLLARS A GALLON!!!!” “SORRY NEXT TIME!!!” we yelled back through our windows. Inching through traffic allowed us to take in the local scenery, which often included cows. What did the cow say to the eclipse traffic? MOOOOOOOOOVE It was quite obvious that the trip back would take way longer than the 5 hours it took to get there, but the question became how long. Google maps claimed there to be no traffic on the main highway we were crawling through, but the unending centipede of taillights stretching before us begged to differ. Right… there was no cell service in the middle of the Green Mountains, and Google maps pulls traffic data from people’s cell phones. meme courtesy of winnie Grace called her mom for advice on how to avoid crawling through the next 200 miles in gridlock. We could keep following Google maps, but that’s what most people are going to do. It’s worth at least checking out the back roads if they’re any better, and lo and behold they were! Again Grace pulled through with the insane driving stamina, Winnie with the navigation, and Terrin, Ilani and I with the backseat cheer crew. The drive back took 7-8 hours including rest stops, which was considered speedy compared to what I’ve heard. ☀️☀️☀️ That was a lot. I gazed at the stars, I witnessed the flight of a meteor, and I beheld the alignment of the moon and the sun against the most brilliant of dusk-dawns. I am so so glad to have chased totality, and so so thankful for the people who I went with.

I had a solar filter placed on it and a Canon EOS Rebel T3i with an eyepiece adaptor that I borrowed (thank you Mike!) I was originally planning on using that cardboard made solar filter you can see in the photo in the left being used by Daina to look at the Sun. I got that borrowed by the Astrogazers at MIT and it is a few sizes bigger than my telescope in diameter, which ofc I was aware of. What I didn’t realize is that the fact the sizes don’t match would make it impossible for the inside of the filter+telescope system to be totally dark. So it didn’t work. Fortunately, Isaac had an extra filter that can be assembled to be placed in the lenses of a camera, and the cap of my telescope has a hole in the middle that I can open in case I want a smaller amount of light entering the telescope (for example, when looking at the Full Moon) and although Isaac’s extra filter was not big enough for the diameter of my telescope, it was bigger than the middle hole of my telescope cap. There was a concern on whether the structure that holds the secondary mirror would cause weird diffraction patterns if I use the central hole but fortunately it didn’t! ⁠ back to text ↑ He didn’t put his camera on a telescope but he had a 300mm lenses in his camera, which was shooting automatically based on some software in his laptop, and his mount was a tracking mount. ⁠ back to text ↑ Educational Studies Program, a club I’m in that runs educational programs for middle and high schoolers ⁠ back to text ↑ seriously, this poor employee 😭 ⁠ back to text ↑ Fiona would like you to know that she is the coolest person ever, and because she’s provided me with this wonderful framing device, I wholeheartedly endorse this message ⁠ back to text ↑ from The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky ⁠ back to text ↑ Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

'23, MEng '24 on impact, art, external validation, and remembering to be kind April 21, 2024 in Art, Literature, Music part 1: impact One of my strongest core beliefs is that the answer to the question “what is the meaning of life?” is not “to change the world,” at least in the way that phrase is typically meant. I think it is very easy to be sold that story, especially at MIT—to be told that your job, your mission , is to solve the world’s great challenges, and that nothing else will suffice, nothing else will make your life meaningful. And, it’s admirable, in a way, to declare this the meaning of life. The world faces many, many great challenges that must be solved, and, surely, it must be our job to fix them. The problem with this framing, I think, is that it makes the “everything else” of our lives mundane and unimportant, in a way that I just don’t believe. If you think about it for a few more moments, the chance that you or any other person will ever have a major, measurable impact on the world is slim to none, but each of us must have a reason to continue living. It may not be true that life itself has a meaning—but we must all have our own meanings to keep going. And, in truth, I do think there is a meaning of life. I wrote three years ago, back in sophomore spring , that for me the meaning of life, in essence, is other people —in the communities we make and the relationships we have, the support we receive from other people and the support we give. I think this because it is the one thing in this world which makes me feel most human , that we interact with one another to make our lives better as a collective. ⁠ 01 this presents a rather naïve view of human nature on the surface, but I think it <em>is</em> ultimately true. If the instinct to war and to act in our self-interest at any given turn was the dominant one, I don't think would have built cities and societies in the way that we have now. It is the one thing that gives me hope about humanity. I am sure there is probably an economic argument to be made that there are systems where self-interest <em>can</em> generate the complexities of our modern lives, but I find those models generally unconvincing because I'm ultimately not sure how many of these attributes of humans can be accurately modeled. Deep down, I’ve believed this even since high school, where I wrote that “to be little, positive parts of other people’s stories is perhaps the best we can hope to be, as we ourselves travel through life.” One other reason that I dislike the idea that one’s mission is to “change the world” is that it fails to present a comprehensive theory of change. ⁠ 02 thanks, Petey. When we say we want something to change, the natural question in my mind is always “how?” When people say, “here’s something I’m mad about and here’s what I’m going to do,” I’m always thinking, “and then what?” How do we get from a point where you do something to a point where the thing you want changed is actually concretely better? This has always been a pet peeve of mine, and, at this point, probably something I’m overly sensitive to, having spent a number of years in various student government positions here. People love saying “this is bad” without really having any idea about how to change it, or going to administrators without doing any kind of proactive work to build relationships and collaborate in a way that actually creates positive progress. And, although I, too, understand the cathartic effects of griping and the legitimacy of many frustrations, I can’t help but think that the ultimate focus needs to be on actions which will, ultimately, drive a specific, positive impact. The “change the world” approach, to me, feels like one of these problematic cases—a mission statement without any sort of theory of change. This may seem like a strawman argument to you, but I do genuinely think there are lots of people who view their mission in life as “changing the world” without any regard as to the “how, specifically?” It’s the same reason that people in Silicon Valley keep trying to found new things rather than improving existing ones. In contrast, the intent to keep making other people’s lives better at a micro-local level, at least to me, presents a coherent theory of change—when we do kind things, other people become more likely to pay it forward, and slowly, but surely, things get better. ⁠ 03 will a kinder world on its own solve climate change, or income inequality, or any of the other billion things facing our species? No, probably not. But, I think 1) we still have an obligation to make the world less sucky while we're still here and 2) kindness does facilitate the kind of collaborations, I think, that will need to solve these kinds of Big Problems. Again, maybe naïve, but, something I feel ultimately to be true. So, that’s what I think. You don’t have to change the world. If you set that as your goal, your one true mission statement, you will more likely end up sad than anything else. But, if you aim at being, on net, a positive influence on the people around you, things might just work out. part 2: art One thing I’m very grateful to MIT for is that it has really allowed me to explore the limits of what I can do, in ways that I never quite imagined. I’ve picked up skills I didn’t think I’d ever learn; last year, in the playwright’s note for a play I wrote called Remembering Her , I put: It is also a play about imagination. Inside and outside the theater, I want you to imagine boldly who you could be. For the prefrosh among us, MIT is a place where you have the opportunity to challenge yourself to do things you never thought possible. Dream big. If you’d told me four years ago that I’d be involved in student government, or conducting a pit orchestra, or writing a show for people to see, I’d have told you that you were mad. But here we are. When you find yourself stuck, imagine a different world, and then find a way to get there. You may find that it is easier than you think. Let’s talk about that play. I wrote it in three days as an emergency back-up for Next Act ⁠ 04 every year since 1985 (excepting the COVID years), a student group called Next Act has put on a musical in Next House during Campus Preview Weekend, meant to <del>inculcate</del> help encourage the prefrosh to come to MIT!. 2023, for reasons that I don’t really want to get into right now. I honestly don’t really remember how I wrote it—I just know I spent a lot of time at my laptop, basically talking to myself, imagining these characters talking to each other, until suddenly there were fifty pages of script in front of me, ready to be rehearsed and revised as necessary. I really struggled during the rehearsal process for the show. I was constantly anxious, between the feeling of having my words read back to me and just the knowledge that I didn’t have a lot of time, if any, to revise anything that felt off. Every once in a while, I would begin to feel hopeful, like the play just might work, only to have it come crashing back down on me a couple of days later—up and down and up and down. I wanted to get off the train. Tech week ⁠ 05 the week before a show goes up, when all the <em>technical elements</em>, i.e., sets and props and costumes and lights and orchestra and Everything™, come together. and shows were like a fever dream. Suddenly, we had a stage and lights and chairs and a steering wheel ⁠ 06 in the play, <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/telling-the-tale/\">Paolo played a teenager named Kevin</a>, who drives a Prius. The Prius is incredibly important, because it is, in fact, eco-friendly <em>and</em> compact. Shyeah. and a pit, and then an audience, and then suddenly it was all over. And, even during shows, my rollercoaster of emotions continued. Every audience was different, responding to different parts of the story night to night; they clapped for different scenes, ⁠ 07 one of the parts of Next Act I'm proudest of—both for myself and for the actors—is when people applauded scenes that were purely dialogue; i.e., without music or singing. On the other hand, this happened most consistently after the absolutely dumbest comedic scene that has no relation to the rest of the plot, which was a bit humbling (but well-deserved for those actors), but it did happen with a couple other plot-related scenes which I am still quite happy about. laughed and “aw”ed at different moment. One day, I’d talk to a friend in more depth about the things I cared about the most in the story, the depiction of two different kinds of families or the mix between comedy and drama, and I’d feel happy about achieving my goals; the next day, I’d wake up and feel listless and hopeless again. After the second show, I wrote in my journal: I am gaining confidence that the script is a good one, but I am increasingly faced with the fact that it is a musical that is not really a musical, and a play that is not really a play, and, apart from this brief moment in which it is producible, I am not sure exactly what value it brings— And, there it is, that funny word. Value . I think the fundamental question, the question which I still haven’t really resolved, is “was it good enough?” It’s the reason I haven’t written about the show until now, a whole year later. I don’t know if it was good enough . Sure, it was well-received, certainly by my friends, and in general, by the audiences that saw it, but it also received so much additional effort above the text. The show had great actors, great lighting designers, great directors, great musicians; it was not my work on stage, but my work modulated and focused by the people around me. When I’m on this train of thought, I often think about Elizabeth Bishop’s ⁠ 08 a poet who wrote \"One Art\", <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/one-art/\">which I parodied a long time ago</a>. One of my favorite poets, she also taught at MIT for some time, although I have never been able to figure out when, exactly. words about creative writing classes. In describing the comparative prevalence of students interested in writing courses, rather than English or literature courses, she once said: It’s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged. The thought is there: maybe I’m not good enough. Maybe I haven’t read enough of the classics, or even the moderns; maybe I don’t yet know or enough to produce great art, or maybe I’m just not built to produce it. I’ve found it very hard to write these past few months. I feel like nothing I write will ever really be good enough; it will never have true, artistic merit, or, at the very least, it will not have the impact I want it to have on readers. I want my words to be able to reach out from the page, grab the reader, and spin them around until they see the world my way, at least for a moment, to make them truly, deeply feel something . I want my writing to have meaning , for it to be edifying, to make people feel like they’ve gotten something out of each and every sentence. But, language is imprecise, and I don’t know if I will ever achieve that in the way I truly, deeply want to. I can feel this question—“was it good enough?” or “what’s the point?”—starting to creep outwards into my life. There are places where the point is clear, or, at the very least, it seems plausible that the things I’m doing have positive societal value. I still love teaching; I still love working on computer systems, however nerdy that pursuit is. It is really in the art where the questions sit at the forefront of my mind. Why conduct? Why sing? Why write? I don’t have any answers beyond this primal desire to do so, this feeling that when I’m conducting or when I’m writing, I’m losing myself in the music and the text, but, the question recurs: why do art when I might not ever be good enough to do it professionally, when I might not ever be able to do anything world-changing? part 3: reconciliation It is very hard to reconcile these two worlds of thoughts—this feeling that the idea of impact is overrated, and this overwhelming feeling that the art I make must have artistic value . Everything about art feels so fleeting and vulnerable that the importance of impact is magnified; after all, the relationship between a person and your art is always transitory. The moment of interaction is always brief, fleeting, and uncertain; a show happens, a poem is written and read, and then it is on to the next thing. How can I make something that lasts or that matters within that context? In this sense, one of the only things that grounds me is, strangely enough, external validation. I often feel uncertain about my relationship with external validation. It seems that for one’s happiness to be truly, deeply complete, ⁠ 09 and there we are, back to the Aristotle. it must be lasting, and external validation is anything but. Yet, it is the thing that most often reminds me that I am achieving my goals, in whatever little ways I can. It reminds me that my art is doing the thing , that when people respond to my work, when they say they “feel seen,” it is becoming a small, positive part of someone else’s life, and that I can release it into the wild. In other words, it provides me a theory of change. I’ve often thought of writing as this kind of deeply lonely task. You sit at your desk, or, in my case, on my bed or on a couch, somewhere, and you type away until you either have a product or you give up. Your writing is founded on observation, sure, but that observation process, I think, is also more often conducted alone, in the solitary moments you have, passing through the world rather than living fully in it. I feel this way about music, too, sometimes. You practice and you learn your music on your own, and then you show up at rehearsal just to put it all together, and, yes, there’s a back and forth, but, ultimately, the practice of it, the individualness of it, feels solitary. You might say, and you would be right, that the writing is just one part of the story. A theatre production—especially one like Next Act, where the whole goal of the project is accepting everyone ⁠ 10 as in, we literally cast everyone who auditions for a show, and we teach them to act, sing, and dance, no matter their skill level. and building community—involves so many people working together in ways that are hard to express, and that, too, is an opportunity to make other people’s lives better, to be a kind collaborator and to work together to make something beautiful. And, similarly, I am grateful for all the feedback I’ve gotten over the years, in poetry workshops and orchestra rehearsals, and for all the work people have invested in things for me , from pit musicians to first readers ⁠ 11 almost everything I've written for the blogs, for instance, goes through a first read, usually from Paolo, Shuli, or CJ. this post was read by my roommate, Krit! to actors to everyone else in between, which has made my life and my work better in countless ways. But, in the moment, when you are working away on a project on your own, it is very easy to forget. It is easy to feel like the audience is the void. That nothing is ever going to respond to your work, to these collections of glyphs on a screen or to the music you are making. And when the audience is the void, it is easy to forget why you should be making art in the first place. Since childhood, I’ve been a big fan of keeping memorabilia . I have so many different objects, from brochures to maps to countless programs from all the shows and concerts I’ve seen or been involved in. I’d like to think I have a pretty good memory, but the concrete objects remind me of the things I’ve done and the places I’ve been in a way that feels more visceral and important. One of my special collections lives outside of my memorabilia crate, ⁠ 12 and, yes, it is a crate. residing instead in the top-most drawer in my desk. It’s a collection of every hand-written thank you note and birthday card and everything else I’ve ever received. Whenever I get a kind email, a note, I file it away for moments where I feel like I am treading water in the void. I read them to remind me that my art and my life have a purpose, and that, as I work, I am still making steps towards achieving it. That the little actions we take each day to make each other’s lives better do matter . And so it is these kinds of moments which kept me going through and after Next Act. I’ve written before that I believe one of the highest compliments that an artist can receive is “this made me cry”; when the things we make can evoke an emotion strong enough in someone else to make them cry. After the first performance, my Head of House, ⁠ 13 at MIT, there is usually a faculty member who lives in the house and helps manage the team of Graduate Residential Assistants and generally serves as a positive influence to the house. Our HoH is Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, who does <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/twists-magic-angle-graphene-map-0508\">some pretty cool stuff with \"magic angle\" graphene</a>. who’d been a part of my time at Next House all four years, told me that it made him cry. Another friend told me it was the first time he’d seen a non-conventional family represented so movingly on stage. It worked. I had added something positive to their lives, however small and transitory. Even still, you forget. It’s so hard to remember the joy and the purpose of making art—every time I put down the pen, it takes me so much more energy to pick it back up again, because I just worry and worry and worry, that it won’t be good enough , rather than thinking about the small, positive differences I could make. I’ve been working on a play again this semester, and it is has been so much harder to write than anything I’ve written before. The expectations and the stakes feel higher, in a way that makes it hard to keep making forward progress, rather than just throwing one’s arms up and giving up. I came back to Next Act this year, this time in a much smaller role: I helped vocal direct and then played percussion ⁠ 14 I kinda got drafted into doing this, but, honestly, I didn't know how much of a joy it would be to just sit around and make noises—I had a glockenspiel, a xylophone, a slapstick, a shaker, some sleigh bells, and a keyboard with which I could make a library of other noises. Truly lovely. On the other hand, I am <em>very</em> not used to counting rests. in the pit orchestra. The show was Legally Blonde , which is one of my favorite musicals, and our conductor was one of my good friends, who lives on 4W ⁠ 15 a living community in Next House, where I lived during my four years of undergrad. and played in the pit for Heathers , my very first conducting gig, just over a year ago. I enjoyed feeling like I was serving a purpose—imparting the wisdom which I’ve sopped up from years of choir in the first role, and then just making a bunch of noises at the right time ⁠ 16 well, most of the time. in the second one. At the second show, during intermission, somebody came up to me and thanked me for Remembering Her . They said that it’d helped them cope with their friend’s passing a month before. And I remembered again. I remembered why it all matters so much. part 4: be kind Really, that’s all there is, at the end of the day. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. Use your life to be a little, positive part of someone else’s story. And, hey, maybe along the way you’ll solve one of the world’s great challenges; maybe you’ll find a job you really love, or a passion that keeps you going, or both, or neither. But, in any case, you’ll have done something that mattered. Maybe you’re not the kind of person who needs a drawerful of notes and anecdotes to remind you that, occasionally, the things you do in the world help other people, that they matter. Maybe you’re not even convinced that these things matter at all in the long run, and we must agree to disagree on the premise entirely. Even still, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s someone in your life who might believe these things, who might need those notes to keep going. So, you know, check in on them. Say “thank you.” Because, at the end of the day, who are we except for the people who made us, us? I want to leave you with a monologue from the play, which is kind of about all of this and is kind of about the passage of time, but is certainly something I believe. It is one of the only pieces of my writing I stand by without a hint of reservation. RACHEL: I guess, when we lost your dad… I didn’t know what we were gonna do. And I was so afraid that we would forget him. And, in some ways, we have. People we love will always be entering and leaving our lives. We’ll never be able to remember every moment precisely, every laugh and smile, every kiss and every disagreement. These things fade, and that’s okay. KEVIN: But what if I don’t want to forget? RACHEL: Memories fade, but their impacts don’t. You know how people say “you are the company you keep”? That’s what they mean. The people you spend time with change you, and if you remember that, and you honor the ways they changed you, well—maybe that’s the best way we can remember them. this presents a rather naïve view of human nature on the surface, but I think it is ultimately true. If the instinct to war and to act in our self-interest at any given turn was the dominant one, I don't think would have built cities and societies in the way that we have now. It is the one thing that gives me hope about humanity. I am sure there is probably an economic argument to be made that there are systems where self-interest can generate the complexities of our modern lives, but I find those models generally unconvincing because I'm ultimately not sure how many of these attributes of humans can be accurately modeled. ⁠ back to text ↑ thanks, Petey. ⁠ back to text ↑ will a kinder world on its own solve climate change, or income inequality, or any of the other billion things facing our species?

Being from The Great State of South Dakota, I am obligated to tell you at least one South Dakota fact before I continue: did you know that South Dakota has a cow-to-human population ratio of over 4 to 1? Okay, on with the other stuff. I live in Next House and have a very extensive list of topics I find interesting and activities I find enjoyable. I like learning about CS and writing, of course, but also about constitutional law, the logistics of airports, and the vast mural of human history. I like walking long distances to take in the surrounding environment, singing along to musicals, taking pictures of scenery, playing the piano poorly, making very specific low-quality memes, and consuming fruit. I love talking about the many other small random things I enjoy and hearing about the same from others. I was once told that by a friend “there is a statistically significant probability...that you are actually a unicorn.” I’m still trying to figure out whether or not that is true, along with many other aspects of who I am and who I want to be, but for now there are many detours to be taken, and many stories to be found.

'23, MEng '24 on impact, art, external validation, and remembering to be kind April 21, 2024 in Art, Literature, Music part 1: impact One of my strongest core beliefs is that the answer to the question “what is the meaning of life?” is not “to change the world,” at least in the way that phrase is typically meant. I think it is very easy to be sold that story, especially at MIT—to be told that your job, your mission , is to solve the world’s great challenges, and that nothing else will suffice, nothing else will make your life meaningful. And, it’s admirable, in a way, to declare this the meaning of life. The world faces many, many great challenges that must be solved, and, surely, it must be our job to fix them. The problem with this framing, I think, is that it makes the “everything else” of our lives mundane and unimportant, in a way that I just don’t believe. If you think about it for a few more moments, the chance that you or any other person will ever have a major, measurable impact on the world is slim to none, but each of us must have a reason to continue living. It may not be true that life itself has a meaning—but we must all have our own meanings to keep going. And, in truth, I do think there is a meaning of life. I wrote three years ago, back in sophomore spring , that for me the meaning of life, in essence, is other people —in the communities we make and the relationships we have, the support we receive from other people and the support we give. I think this because it is the one thing in this world which makes me feel most human , that we interact with one another to make our lives better as a collective. ⁠ 01 this presents a rather naïve view of human nature on the surface, but I think it <em>is</em> ultimately true. If the instinct to war and to act in our self-interest at any given turn was the dominant one, I don't think would have built cities and societies in the way that we have now. It is the one thing that gives me hope about humanity. I am sure there is probably an economic argument to be made that there are systems where self-interest <em>can</em> generate the complexities of our modern lives, but I find those models generally unconvincing because I'm ultimately not sure how many of these attributes of humans can be accurately modeled. Deep down, I’ve believed this even since high school, where I wrote that “to be little, positive parts of other people’s stories is perhaps the best we can hope to be, as we ourselves travel through life.” One other reason that I dislike the idea that one’s mission is to “change the world” is that it fails to present a comprehensive theory of change. ⁠ 02 thanks, Petey. When we say we want something to change, the natural question in my mind is always “how?” When people say, “here’s something I’m mad about and here’s what I’m going to do,” I’m always thinking, “and then what?” How do we get from a point where you do something to a point where the thing you want changed is actually concretely better? This has always been a pet peeve of mine, and, at this point, probably something I’m overly sensitive to, having spent a number of years in various student government positions here. People love saying “this is bad” without really having any idea about how to change it, or going to administrators without doing any kind of proactive work to build relationships and collaborate in a way that actually creates positive progress. And, although I, too, understand the cathartic effects of griping and the legitimacy of many frustrations, I can’t help but think that the ultimate focus needs to be on actions which will, ultimately, drive a specific, positive impact. The “change the world” approach, to me, feels like one of these problematic cases—a mission statement without any sort of theory of change. This may seem like a strawman argument to you, but I do genuinely think there are lots of people who view their mission in life as “changing the world” without any regard as to the “how, specifically?” It’s the same reason that people in Silicon Valley keep trying to found new things rather than improving existing ones. In contrast, the intent to keep making other people’s lives better at a micro-local level, at least to me, presents a coherent theory of change—when we do kind things, other people become more likely to pay it forward, and slowly, but surely, things get better. ⁠ 03 will a kinder world on its own solve climate change, or income inequality, or any of the other billion things facing our species? No, probably not. But, I think 1) we still have an obligation to make the world less sucky while we're still here and 2) kindness does facilitate the kind of collaborations, I think, that will need to solve these kinds of Big Problems. Again, maybe naïve, but, something I feel ultimately to be true. So, that’s what I think. You don’t have to change the world. If you set that as your goal, your one true mission statement, you will more likely end up sad than anything else. But, if you aim at being, on net, a positive influence on the people around you, things might just work out. part 2: art One thing I’m very grateful to MIT for is that it has really allowed me to explore the limits of what I can do, in ways that I never quite imagined. I’ve picked up skills I didn’t think I’d ever learn; last year, in the playwright’s note for a play I wrote called Remembering Her , I put: It is also a play about imagination. Inside and outside the theater, I want you to imagine boldly who you could be. For the prefrosh among us, MIT is a place where you have the opportunity to challenge yourself to do things you never thought possible. Dream big. If you’d told me four years ago that I’d be involved in student government, or conducting a pit orchestra, or writing a show for people to see, I’d have told you that you were mad. But here we are. When you find yourself stuck, imagine a different world, and then find a way to get there. You may find that it is easier than you think. Let’s talk about that play. I wrote it in three days as an emergency back-up for Next Act ⁠ 04 every year since 1985 (excepting the COVID years), a student group called Next Act has put on a musical in Next House during Campus Preview Weekend, meant to <del>inculcate</del> help encourage the prefrosh to come to MIT!. 2023, for reasons that I don’t really want to get into right now. I honestly don’t really remember how I wrote it—I just know I spent a lot of time at my laptop, basically talking to myself, imagining these characters talking to each other, until suddenly there were fifty pages of script in front of me, ready to be rehearsed and revised as necessary. I really struggled during the rehearsal process for the show. I was constantly anxious, between the feeling of having my words read back to me and just the knowledge that I didn’t have a lot of time, if any, to revise anything that felt off. Every once in a while, I would begin to feel hopeful, like the play just might work, only to have it come crashing back down on me a couple of days later—up and down and up and down. I wanted to get off the train. Tech week ⁠ 05 the week before a show goes up, when all the <em>technical elements</em>, i.e., sets and props and costumes and lights and orchestra and Everything™, come together. and shows were like a fever dream. Suddenly, we had a stage and lights and chairs and a steering wheel ⁠ 06 in the play, <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/telling-the-tale/\">Paolo played a teenager named Kevin</a>, who drives a Prius. The Prius is incredibly important, because it is, in fact, eco-friendly <em>and</em> compact. Shyeah. and a pit, and then an audience, and then suddenly it was all over. And, even during shows, my rollercoaster of emotions continued. Every audience was different, responding to different parts of the story night to night; they clapped for different scenes, ⁠ 07 one of the parts of Next Act I'm proudest of—both for myself and for the actors—is when people applauded scenes that were purely dialogue; i.e., without music or singing. On the other hand, this happened most consistently after the absolutely dumbest comedic scene that has no relation to the rest of the plot, which was a bit humbling (but well-deserved for those actors), but it did happen with a couple other plot-related scenes which I am still quite happy about. laughed and “aw”ed at different moment. One day, I’d talk to a friend in more depth about the things I cared about the most in the story, the depiction of two different kinds of families or the mix between comedy and drama, and I’d feel happy about achieving my goals; the next day, I’d wake up and feel listless and hopeless again. After the second show, I wrote in my journal: I am gaining confidence that the script is a good one, but I am increasingly faced with the fact that it is a musical that is not really a musical, and a play that is not really a play, and, apart from this brief moment in which it is producible, I am not sure exactly what value it brings— And, there it is, that funny word. Value . I think the fundamental question, the question which I still haven’t really resolved, is “was it good enough?” It’s the reason I haven’t written about the show until now, a whole year later. I don’t know if it was good enough . Sure, it was well-received, certainly by my friends, and in general, by the audiences that saw it, but it also received so much additional effort above the text. The show had great actors, great lighting designers, great directors, great musicians; it was not my work on stage, but my work modulated and focused by the people around me. When I’m on this train of thought, I often think about Elizabeth Bishop’s ⁠ 08 a poet who wrote \"One Art\", <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/one-art/\">which I parodied a long time ago</a>. One of my favorite poets, she also taught at MIT for some time, although I have never been able to figure out when, exactly. words about creative writing classes. In describing the comparative prevalence of students interested in writing courses, rather than English or literature courses, she once said: It’s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged. The thought is there: maybe I’m not good enough. Maybe I haven’t read enough of the classics, or even the moderns; maybe I don’t yet know or enough to produce great art, or maybe I’m just not built to produce it. I’ve found it very hard to write these past few months. I feel like nothing I write will ever really be good enough; it will never have true, artistic merit, or, at the very least, it will not have the impact I want it to have on readers. I want my words to be able to reach out from the page, grab the reader, and spin them around until they see the world my way, at least for a moment, to make them truly, deeply feel something . I want my writing to have meaning , for it to be edifying, to make people feel like they’ve gotten something out of each and every sentence. But, language is imprecise, and I don’t know if I will ever achieve that in the way I truly, deeply want to. I can feel this question—“was it good enough?” or “what’s the point?”—starting to creep outwards into my life. There are places where the point is clear, or, at the very least, it seems plausible that the things I’m doing have positive societal value. I still love teaching; I still love working on computer systems, however nerdy that pursuit is. It is really in the art where the questions sit at the forefront of my mind. Why conduct? Why sing? Why write? I don’t have any answers beyond this primal desire to do so, this feeling that when I’m conducting or when I’m writing, I’m losing myself in the music and the text, but, the question recurs: why do art when I might not ever be good enough to do it professionally, when I might not ever be able to do anything world-changing? part 3: reconciliation It is very hard to reconcile these two worlds of thoughts—this feeling that the idea of impact is overrated, and this overwhelming feeling that the art I make must have artistic value . Everything about art feels so fleeting and vulnerable that the importance of impact is magnified; after all, the relationship between a person and your art is always transitory. The moment of interaction is always brief, fleeting, and uncertain; a show happens, a poem is written and read, and then it is on to the next thing. How can I make something that lasts or that matters within that context? In this sense, one of the only things that grounds me is, strangely enough, external validation. I often feel uncertain about my relationship with external validation. It seems that for one’s happiness to be truly, deeply complete, ⁠ 09 and there we are, back to the Aristotle. it must be lasting, and external validation is anything but. Yet, it is the thing that most often reminds me that I am achieving my goals, in whatever little ways I can. It reminds me that my art is doing the thing , that when people respond to my work, when they say they “feel seen,” it is becoming a small, positive part of someone else’s life, and that I can release it into the wild. In other words, it provides me a theory of change. I’ve often thought of writing as this kind of deeply lonely task. You sit at your desk, or, in my case, on my bed or on a couch, somewhere, and you type away until you either have a product or you give up. Your writing is founded on observation, sure, but that observation process, I think, is also more often conducted alone, in the solitary moments you have, passing through the world rather than living fully in it. I feel this way about music, too, sometimes. You practice and you learn your music on your own, and then you show up at rehearsal just to put it all together, and, yes, there’s a back and forth, but, ultimately, the practice of it, the individualness of it, feels solitary. You might say, and you would be right, that the writing is just one part of the story. A theatre production—especially one like Next Act, where the whole goal of the project is accepting everyone ⁠ 10 as in, we literally cast everyone who auditions for a show, and we teach them to act, sing, and dance, no matter their skill level. and building community—involves so many people working together in ways that are hard to express, and that, too, is an opportunity to make other people’s lives better, to be a kind collaborator and to work together to make something beautiful. And, similarly, I am grateful for all the feedback I’ve gotten over the years, in poetry workshops and orchestra rehearsals, and for all the work people have invested in things for me , from pit musicians to first readers ⁠ 11 almost everything I've written for the blogs, for instance, goes through a first read, usually from Paolo, Shuli, or CJ. this post was read by my roommate, Krit! to actors to everyone else in between, which has made my life and my work better in countless ways. But, in the moment, when you are working away on a project on your own, it is very easy to forget. It is easy to feel like the audience is the void. That nothing is ever going to respond to your work, to these collections of glyphs on a screen or to the music you are making. And when the audience is the void, it is easy to forget why you should be making art in the first place. Since childhood, I’ve been a big fan of keeping memorabilia . I have so many different objects, from brochures to maps to countless programs from all the shows and concerts I’ve seen or been involved in. I’d like to think I have a pretty good memory, but the concrete objects remind me of the things I’ve done and the places I’ve been in a way that feels more visceral and important. One of my special collections lives outside of my memorabilia crate, ⁠ 12 and, yes, it is a crate. residing instead in the top-most drawer in my desk. It’s a collection of every hand-written thank you note and birthday card and everything else I’ve ever received. Whenever I get a kind email, a note, I file it away for moments where I feel like I am treading water in the void. I read them to remind me that my art and my life have a purpose, and that, as I work, I am still making steps towards achieving it. That the little actions we take each day to make each other’s lives better do matter . And so it is these kinds of moments which kept me going through and after Next Act. I’ve written before that I believe one of the highest compliments that an artist can receive is “this made me cry”; when the things we make can evoke an emotion strong enough in someone else to make them cry. After the first performance, my Head of House, ⁠ 13 at MIT, there is usually a faculty member who lives in the house and helps manage the team of Graduate Residential Assistants and generally serves as a positive influence to the house. Our HoH is Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, who does <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/twists-magic-angle-graphene-map-0508\">some pretty cool stuff with \"magic angle\" graphene</a>. who’d been a part of my time at Next House all four years, told me that it made him cry. Another friend told me it was the first time he’d seen a non-conventional family represented so movingly on stage. It worked. I had added something positive to their lives, however small and transitory. Even still, you forget. It’s so hard to remember the joy and the purpose of making art—every time I put down the pen, it takes me so much more energy to pick it back up again, because I just worry and worry and worry, that it won’t be good enough , rather than thinking about the small, positive differences I could make. I’ve been working on a play again this semester, and it is has been so much harder to write than anything I’ve written before. The expectations and the stakes feel higher, in a way that makes it hard to keep making forward progress, rather than just throwing one’s arms up and giving up. I came back to Next Act this year, this time in a much smaller role: I helped vocal direct and then played percussion ⁠ 14 I kinda got drafted into doing this, but, honestly, I didn't know how much of a joy it would be to just sit around and make noises—I had a glockenspiel, a xylophone, a slapstick, a shaker, some sleigh bells, and a keyboard with which I could make a library of other noises. Truly lovely. On the other hand, I am <em>very</em> not used to counting rests. in the pit orchestra. The show was Legally Blonde , which is one of my favorite musicals, and our conductor was one of my good friends, who lives on 4W ⁠ 15 a living community in Next House, where I lived during my four years of undergrad. and played in the pit for Heathers , my very first conducting gig, just over a year ago. I enjoyed feeling like I was serving a purpose—imparting the wisdom which I’ve sopped up from years of choir in the first role, and then just making a bunch of noises at the right time ⁠ 16 well, most of the time. in the second one. At the second show, during intermission, somebody came up to me and thanked me for Remembering Her . They said that it’d helped them cope with their friend’s passing a month before. And I remembered again. I remembered why it all matters so much. part 4: be kind Really, that’s all there is, at the end of the day. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. Use your life to be a little, positive part of someone else’s story. And, hey, maybe along the way you’ll solve one of the world’s great challenges; maybe you’ll find a job you really love, or a passion that keeps you going, or both, or neither. But, in any case, you’ll have done something that mattered. Maybe you’re not the kind of person who needs a drawerful of notes and anecdotes to remind you that, occasionally, the things you do in the world help other people, that they matter. Maybe you’re not even convinced that these things matter at all in the long run, and we must agree to disagree on the premise entirely. Even still, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s someone in your life who might believe these things, who might need those notes to keep going. So, you know, check in on them. Say “thank you.” Because, at the end of the day, who are we except for the people who made us, us? I want to leave you with a monologue from the play, which is kind of about all of this and is kind of about the passage of time, but is certainly something I believe. It is one of the only pieces of my writing I stand by without a hint of reservation. RACHEL: I guess, when we lost your dad… I didn’t know what we were gonna do. And I was so afraid that we would forget him. And, in some ways, we have. People we love will always be entering and leaving our lives. We’ll never be able to remember every moment precisely, every laugh and smile, every kiss and every disagreement. These things fade, and that’s okay. KEVIN: But what if I don’t want to forget? RACHEL: Memories fade, but their impacts don’t. You know how people say “you are the company you keep”? That’s what they mean. The people you spend time with change you, and if you remember that, and you honor the ways they changed you, well—maybe that’s the best way we can remember them. this presents a rather naïve view of human nature on the surface, but I think it is ultimately true. If the instinct to war and to act in our self-interest at any given turn was the dominant one, I don't think would have built cities and societies in the way that we have now. It is the one thing that gives me hope about humanity. I am sure there is probably an economic argument to be made that there are systems where self-interest can generate the complexities of our modern lives, but I find those models generally unconvincing because I'm ultimately not sure how many of these attributes of humans can be accurately modeled. ⁠ back to text ↑ thanks, Petey. ⁠ back to text ↑ will a kinder world on its own solve climate change, or income inequality, or any of the other billion things facing our species?

'25 There are two wolves inside you April 20, 2024 in Academics & Research , UROP & Other Research Did you know? Of all 7,238 MIT Admissions blog posts before this one, only four ⁠ 01 I’m only counting blogs that explicitly use the LaTeX tag in WordPress contain equations typeset in \\(\\LaTeX\\). And they’re all Paolo’s ! That changes today. MIT exposes us to so many beautiful mathematical concepts, so Paige and Fatima have challenged us bloggers to write posts about these concepts this month. To kick off this challenge, let me tell you about duality – a neat little concept that shows up everywhere, from algorithms to superconducting circuits. What is duality? As a non-mathematician, I think it’s hard to define duality succinctly yet intuitively. I usually just kind of wave my hands and say, “Uhh, it’s like when two things are different, but they’re actually the same.” So instead of attempting to define it, here’s a concrete example. Suppose you draw two points on a sheet of paper. If you want to connect those two points using a straight line, there’s only one way to do it. So we say that two points define a line . Now suppose you draw two lines on a sheet of paper (but make the lines infinitely long). Assuming these lines are not parallel, they intersect each other exactly once. So we say that two (non-parallel) lines define a point . This is a duality! Points and lines are clearly different, but these two statements reveal a striking symmetry between them. (Minor spoiler for Paige’s post: You can represent points as coordinates \\((a, b)\\) and lines as equations \\(ax – b\\). Try turning points into lines and vice versa, and see what happens!) Duality shows up everywhere in mathematics. Wikipedia lists a few dozen famous examples , and I’m sure there are hundreds more that people have discovered. Applications to engineering In addition to being fun to think about, duality is an S-tier mathematical concept to me because it often applies to physical systems and helps simplify complex problems. Specifically, I use duality to analyze electrical circuits. In physics, electric fields (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)) and magnetic fields (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) are duals. For every equation involving \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), there’s an equivalent equation involving \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and vice versa. You can see this symmetry in Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum ⁠ 02 The full Maxwell’s equations involve some more stuff, but don’t worry about that for now. : \\(\\begin{aligned} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0 &\\qquad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 &\\qquad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} \\end{aligned}\\) As a result, every circuit component that does something with electrical charge has a dual component that does the same thing with magnetic flux . For example, capacitors (components that store charge) and inductors (components that store flux) are duals: \\(\\begin{aligned} i = C \\frac{dv}{dt} \\iff v = L \\frac{di}{dt} \\end{aligned}\\) In fact, every circuit has a “dual circuit”, where voltages in the original circuit correspond to currents in the dual circuit, and vice versa: An example of dual circuits taken from Wikipedia Furthermore, the current (flow of electrical charge) in the dual circuit represents how magnetic flux flows through the original circuit! Again, this is thanks to symmetry: \\(\\begin{aligned} v = iR + L \\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{C} &\\qquad v = \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} \\\\ i = \\frac{v}{R} + C \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{\\Phi}{L} &\\qquad i = \\frac{dQ}{dt} \\end{aligned}\\) This particular duality is especially important for me because I do research with superconducting electronics , where it ’s often more convenient to describe circuits in terms of magnetic flux flow instead of current/voltage. For example, Josephson junctions ⁠ 03 The subject of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics are weird devices that require a whole page of quantum mechanics to explain in terms of current/voltage. But when viewed in terms of magnetic flux flow, they’re essentially just switches – much easier to understand than quantum mechanics! Duality is a gift that keeps on giving, and I hope we’ll see even more of it in the other bloggers’ posts this month.

Although you could probably check up on that Olympic thing. > Developer Notes: I suppose this is the part where I give you actual useful information about me, so here we go! I originally planned to major in course 3 (materials science), but after a brief personal crisis, I’m now majoring in course 6-2 (EECS) and minoring in course 3. I always liked software engineering because it makes computers go “beep boop”, but I discovered at MIT that magnets and semiconductors also go “bzzt clang zing”, which is pretty cool. I love making (and breaking) things – I’ll build anything that brings smiles to my friends’ faces, from giant MBTA maps to cursed MIT logos. Hopefully, my blog posts will also make you smile! :D (And just for reference, the “backstory” is adapted from Daria’s homepage on Virtual Lawndale – a now-defunct website about the ‘90s show Daria).

'25 skrt skrt April 20, 2024 in MIT Life Something I learned very quickly when I first got to MIT is that our campus is deceivingly large. Freshman year, I made the unfortunate decision to attend the 9 am option for my physics lectures – which was admittedly a bit optimistic on my part. The mornings I had physics, I would wake up at 8:50 am and frantically dash from my dorm to class. Nothing will ever feel as far as that walk from New Vassar to the physics building. ⁠ 01 Looking it up now, that’s only 0.3 miles… BUT STILL That was my first taste of trekking around campus. MIT’s campus is a whopping 168 acres – which is 1.5x bigger than Vatican City! To get from one end of campus to another, such as from Tang Hall to the Sloan School of Management, it would be a 1.2 mile walk. ⁠ 02 Which is about the length of 12,672 standard sized hotdogs, if you’re curious. This may seem a bit daunting, but don’t worry! There is a solution: the almighty MIT time. MIT time is a rule that applies to every single class at MIT ⁠ 03 at least for undergrads that states that class starts 5 minutes later and ends 5 minutes earlier than its scheduled time. While MIT time helps, it’s not quite enough, so all of us have had to come up with some ways of getting around campus a bit faster. That brings us to our topic today! There are many different modes of transportation around campus, and each has its own pros and cons and silly stereotypes. So here’s what your chosen mode of transportation says about you. 1. Bikes You are down-to-earth. You are very diligent, and everyone wants to be your partner in a group project. You probably like to hike or do something outdoors-y. You’re a pro at avoiding the most dangerous thing on planet Earth. ⁠ 04 Boston drivers A car has definitely almost hit you while turning off the bridge, and ever since then you’ve been wearing a helmet. You properly lock up your bike in the rack, although you sometimes forget where you locked it up and for a split second you think someone stole it. You do not cause issues, and everyone should try to be more like you. Safety first! Lowkey this bike is so drippy. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 2. Blue Bikes You are not to be confused with the people that own a bike. You got the $40 yearly Blue Bike deal for students, and now every time you and your friends go somewhere that requires more than 5 minutes of walking you say, “Well, we could just Blue Bike…” You probably take some classes at Sloan, and you will be seen pedaling furiously down the sidewalk with your MIT Sloan backpack bumping along with you as you try to make it to class on time. You are a bit chaotic, but you embrace it, and everyone loves you for it! The Blue Bike station on the Boston side of the bridge. Blue Bike aesthetic An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 3. Razor Scooter If your transportation of choice is a Razor Scooter, you live on campus or in Cambridge – and it is very likely you are a male athlete in a fraternity. You ride the scooter in packs, with three of your fellow male athletes accompanying you on your journey. You never ride them particularly fast – in fact, you rarely scoot faster than walking pace. You usually park them in piles outside of the locker room or outside of the dining halls. You’ve come to terms with the fact that, when it rains, your pants will be perpetually wet from the wheel spray. You are nice and often let your friends use your scooter when they’re in a time crunch. They’re all a bit rusty from overuse, but your Razor scooter has been with you since freshman year, and you will continue to use it until you graduate. Razor scooter + crocs!! Scooter pile outside Vassy D. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 4. Electric Scooter You are a menace, and you most likely live across the bridge in Boston. Other students find you annoying because you zip around campus, narrowly avoid pedestrians, and casually gun 20+ mph on the bridge – yet somehow you’re still always late to class. Your friends always try to convince you to let them hitch a ride on your scooter (which involves a weirdly intimate ride as you both cram onto the scooter and hang on for dear life). You either drive a literal tank (200 pounds, can go 50 mph) or something with two wheels and a slapped-on motor that they then called an electric scooter. You are on your second scooter because the first one was stolen! Because you’ve ridden it so much and because Boston streets aren’t exactly smooth, your scooter is in disrepair, and you should probably go get that fixed instead of duct taping it over and over again. ⁠ 05 This is a direct @ to myself because my scooter battery is currently being held in place by a roll of duct tape… oops Me and my friends scooting across the bridge in the morning! Two of my sorority sisters performing the famous double scoot. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 5. Skateboards You are cool and a bit of an enigma. You like to skateboard over the Charles River – and with the wind whipping your hair and the sun rising over the river, you are definitely giving off main character energy. You are an academic weapon, you always help people out with PSETs, and you do it all while maintaining this certain level of chill-ness. You have unbreakable confidence, and your ability to gracefully roll over cracks and not face plant is awe inspiring. Also, you definitely either ski or snowboard. Look how natural and cool! So chill. So cool. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 6. MIT Shuttle MIT has a couple of shuttle systems: some that take you from your off-campus housing in Boston to campus, some that are inter-campus, and some that take you to places like Trader Joes. If this is your mode of transportation, you are just trying to go about your daily life. You probably have submitted at least a dozen complaints about the inconsistency of the shuttles, but you are still loyal to them because you refuse to get a scooter. Your entire schedule revolves around the shuttle and when it will pick you up. You spend a lot of time at the Stud, your daily workout comes from sprinting to make the shuttle in time, and you like to hang out with others while you do homework. You like seeing your friends on it in the mornings, and when it gets cold and snowy out, riding the shuttle home with the squad always makes you feel cozy. MIT shuttle in the wild. Map of the shuttle route. We <3 the shuttle An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 7. Others If you are any of these other ones, then you’re someone that makes MIT unique and fun. These others include people that rollerblade (especially that person that rollerblades down Massachusetts Avenue with a Hydroflask balanced on their head – you’re so cool) and that one guy that just rides that giant wheel around. Also, shoutout to the people that just walk. That’s what’s up. At the end of the day, just remember folks: “It’s not about how you get around, but how much you get around” – anonymous skateboarder. Have fun whipping around campus and keep doing your best to make it to class on time!

'25 skrt skrt April 20, 2024 in MIT Life Something I learned very quickly when I first got to MIT is that our campus is deceivingly large. Freshman year, I made the unfortunate decision to attend the 9 am option for my physics lectures – which was admittedly a bit optimistic on my part. The mornings I had physics, I would wake up at 8:50 am and frantically dash from my dorm to class. Nothing will ever feel as far as that walk from New Vassar to the physics building. ⁠ 01 Looking it up now, that’s only 0.3 miles… BUT STILL That was my first taste of trekking around campus. MIT’s campus is a whopping 168 acres – which is 1.5x bigger than Vatican City! To get from one end of campus to another, such as from Tang Hall to the Sloan School of Management, it would be a 1.2 mile walk. ⁠ 02 Which is about the length of 12,672 standard sized hotdogs, if you’re curious. This may seem a bit daunting, but don’t worry! There is a solution: the almighty MIT time. MIT time is a rule that applies to every single class at MIT ⁠ 03 at least for undergrads that states that class starts 5 minutes later and ends 5 minutes earlier than its scheduled time. While MIT time helps, it’s not quite enough, so all of us have had to come up with some ways of getting around campus a bit faster. That brings us to our topic today! There are many different modes of transportation around campus, and each has its own pros and cons and silly stereotypes. So here’s what your chosen mode of transportation says about you. 1. Bikes You are down-to-earth. You are very diligent, and everyone wants to be your partner in a group project. You probably like to hike or do something outdoors-y. You’re a pro at avoiding the most dangerous thing on planet Earth. ⁠ 04 Boston drivers A car has definitely almost hit you while turning off the bridge, and ever since then you’ve been wearing a helmet. You properly lock up your bike in the rack, although you sometimes forget where you locked it up and for a split second you think someone stole it. You do not cause issues, and everyone should try to be more like you. Safety first! Lowkey this bike is so drippy. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 2. Blue Bikes You are not to be confused with the people that own a bike. You got the $40 yearly Blue Bike deal for students, and now every time you and your friends go somewhere that requires more than 5 minutes of walking you say, “Well, we could just Blue Bike…” You probably take some classes at Sloan, and you will be seen pedaling furiously down the sidewalk with your MIT Sloan backpack bumping along with you as you try to make it to class on time. You are a bit chaotic, but you embrace it, and everyone loves you for it! The Blue Bike station on the Boston side of the bridge. Blue Bike aesthetic An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 3. Razor Scooter If your transportation of choice is a Razor Scooter, you live on campus or in Cambridge – and it is very likely you are a male athlete in a fraternity. You ride the scooter in packs, with three of your fellow male athletes accompanying you on your journey. You never ride them particularly fast – in fact, you rarely scoot faster than walking pace. You usually park them in piles outside of the locker room or outside of the dining halls. You’ve come to terms with the fact that, when it rains, your pants will be perpetually wet from the wheel spray. You are nice and often let your friends use your scooter when they’re in a time crunch. They’re all a bit rusty from overuse, but your Razor scooter has been with you since freshman year, and you will continue to use it until you graduate. Razor scooter + crocs!! Scooter pile outside Vassy D. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 4. Electric Scooter You are a menace, and you most likely live across the bridge in Boston. Other students find you annoying because you zip around campus, narrowly avoid pedestrians, and casually gun 20+ mph on the bridge – yet somehow you’re still always late to class. Your friends always try to convince you to let them hitch a ride on your scooter (which involves a weirdly intimate ride as you both cram onto the scooter and hang on for dear life). You either drive a literal tank (200 pounds, can go 50 mph) or something with two wheels and a slapped-on motor that they then called an electric scooter. You are on your second scooter because the first one was stolen! Because you’ve ridden it so much and because Boston streets aren’t exactly smooth, your scooter is in disrepair, and you should probably go get that fixed instead of duct taping it over and over again. ⁠ 05 This is a direct @ to myself because my scooter battery is currently being held in place by a roll of duct tape… oops Me and my friends scooting across the bridge in the morning! Two of my sorority sisters performing the famous double scoot. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 5. Skateboards You are cool and a bit of an enigma. You like to skateboard over the Charles River – and with the wind whipping your hair and the sun rising over the river, you are definitely giving off main character energy. You are an academic weapon, you always help people out with PSETs, and you do it all while maintaining this certain level of chill-ness. You have unbreakable confidence, and your ability to gracefully roll over cracks and not face plant is awe inspiring. Also, you definitely either ski or snowboard. Look how natural and cool! So chill. So cool. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 6. MIT Shuttle MIT has a couple of shuttle systems: some that take you from your off-campus housing in Boston to campus, some that are inter-campus, and some that take you to places like Trader Joes. If this is your mode of transportation, you are just trying to go about your daily life. You probably have submitted at least a dozen complaints about the inconsistency of the shuttles, but you are still loyal to them because you refuse to get a scooter. Your entire schedule revolves around the shuttle and when it will pick you up. You spend a lot of time at the Stud, your daily workout comes from sprinting to make the shuttle in time, and you like to hang out with others while you do homework. You like seeing your friends on it in the mornings, and when it gets cold and snowy out, riding the shuttle home with the squad always makes you feel cozy. MIT shuttle in the wild. Map of the shuttle route. We <3 the shuttle An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 7. Others If you are any of these other ones, then you’re someone that makes MIT unique and fun. These others include people that rollerblade (especially that person that rollerblades down Massachusetts Avenue with a Hydroflask balanced on their head – you’re so cool) and that one guy that just rides that giant wheel around. Also, shoutout to the people that just walk. That’s what’s up. At the end of the day, just remember folks: “It’s not about how you get around, but how much you get around” – anonymous skateboarder. Have fun whipping around campus and keep doing your best to make it to class on time!

In particular, this means the aurora borealis/australis are at their brightest, and since flights were also relatively cheap,  for spring break my friends and I decided to travel to Iceland!! This was my first time ever traveling with just friends (no Real Adults^TM?!?), and it was a lot of fun! We planned out an itinerary, booked a hotel, found places to eat, and somehow explored a different country without falling into any volcanos. The scenery was beautiful, the food was tasty, the nearby park had mini trampolines, and the wind was trying to eat us. It felt so very college :D I won’t bore you with the details, even though it was AMAZING and I feel so lucky, but I did write a handful of rhymes for giggles on our bus rides, so here’s those interspersed with some photos of Iceland (that kinda? match? not really? maybe?).

I had happened to see the total eclipse in 2017 in Idaho during an emergency burnout vacation when I drove ~2,300 miles around the mountain west, and it was an incredible experience, so I knew I had to see it again, and bring my family this time. what if we gathered in vermont and stared directly at the sun…ha ha jk…unless? I know some current bloggers went, too, and will be posting their experiences soon. But a number of alum bloggers did too, so I asked if I could collect their old-timey tales. To be honest, the experience isn’t describable, and I didn’t even attempt to take pictures. But some of our cruft are better at words and cameras than me, so here are some of those who responded to me. Michael C ’16 Here in Dallas, the cloud forecast was looking gloomy all month and up to the morning of April 8. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time staring at the blue and gray contours of satellite weather imagery and learning the difference between GFS, ECMWF, and NAM. But like magic, 8 minutes before totality the clouds totally dissipated and we had perfect views of the eclipse. In these images you can see ruby-colored solar prominences, planet-sized loops of plasma hanging off the sun. You can also see Bailey’s Beads right on the edge of the eclipse, caused by rugged craters on the moon’s surface. Truly a magical experience that you have to see in person. (Minor digression: through a stroke of luck, my car rental reservation for a sedan was upgraded to an enormous fuel-guzzling pickup truck. As a Californian who normally drives a pragmatic efficient EV I’ve now been radicalized to being a Truck Guy, much to the chagrin of my wife Steph C ’15). An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Caroline M. ’18 Had lots of clouds, but got to see it last min!! My coworker made it into album art and it gives *Halloween* An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Laura N. ’09 These days I am a high school science teacher. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to travel to the path of totality and I didn’t take any pictures, but I did collect temperature and cloud data for NASA with the Globe Observer citizen science project. This graph shows the temperature change experienced at my location, which saw about 93% coverage. I’ll be using this in my classes in a few weeks to introduce radiation heat transfer to my physics students! Lydia K. ’14, MEng ’16 My partner Cory ’13 and his high school friend Robert and I roadtripped to Bangor, Maine, to see totality in Millinocket, Maine. In total we drove (well, Robert drove; I worked in the back of the car and Cory played Mario and Rabbids) 12 hours, including four there, four back, and four in traffic from Millinocket back to Bangor. We hiked in the snow during the eclipse leading up to totality, squinting up at the sun getting eaten by the moon like a cookie through eclipse glasses and the Celestron 12x50mm solar binoculars I’d bought for the occasion (one of the very last two from Walmart online, the other of which went to my dad for his birthday). Robert and Cory had rescued a guy whose car got stuck in the snow-mud, and he and his dog Radar hiked with us until they got to their eclipse-watching spot. When we got back to the car, another guy’s car was stuck in the snow-mud, but he was embarrassed and didn’t want help. We watched the rest of the lead-up from the car, and then, when it started getting dark, from outside. It got dark, and grey, but not like at sunset, and sharp shadows came out, not at all like the soft shadows at sunset. It got cold. I put on my sweater (it had been t-shirt weather all day) and then my jacket over it. We could see planets shining in the sky. Everyone was quiet; even the sound of traffic was gone. Dogs barked. The actual event was extraordinary. It was like everyone here describes it, and it looked just like the photos in this blog post. It was worth the drive.

As Director of Special Projects at MIT Admissions + Student Financial Services, I work on a bunch of stuff in our office, including the blogs you're reading right now. Sometimes, I teach courses in CMS/W , from which I earned my grad rat in 2013. While MIT attracts people from all over the world, I'm a fairly local guy: I was born a few towns north of Cambridge, and for a good while had the accent to prove it (now it mostly comes out during Bruins games ). But I'd never been to MIT, or even known anyone to attend here, before I showed up for my interview to be an admissions counselor for web communications. I was a senior in college. I'd applied to 63 jobs and only MIT had called me back. I got lost, first parking, then along the Infinite . But Matt decided to hire me anyway. And MIT has been my home ever since. In my life I've attended or worked at public schools and private schools; schools in cities and schools in the sticks; schools with sterling international reputations for brilliance and schools with sterling international reputations for rioting. But I've never been anywhere quite like MIT. The character of the campus community is truly unique - supported by a robust intelligence and animated by a thrumming trickster spirit . Where else can you get up from your desk, walk past Woodie Flowers' office to cross the street for the best burrito in Boston helpfully irradiated by the local nuclear reactor ? Where else can you leave your exhausting research at the Laboratory for Chocolate Science and run to catch your friends for a round of underwater hockey , a game which combines the thrilling rush of hypoxia with the club rave psychedelia of swallowing dissolved lead? It's an awesome place to work, an incredible place to live, and I'm ecstatic to be a part of it. I spend a lot of time geeking out about various things, eating hamburgers , and occasionally escaping Boston for the New Hampshire woods where I feel most at home. I’m allergic to cats and cat macros. I like bouldering, Archer , and helping students.

I had happened to see the total eclipse in 2017 in Idaho during an emergency burnout vacation when I drove ~2,300 miles around the mountain west, and it was an incredible experience, so I knew I had to see it again, and bring my family this time. what if we gathered in vermont and stared directly at the sun…ha ha jk…unless? I know some current bloggers went, too, and will be posting their experiences soon. But a number of alum bloggers did too, so I asked if I could collect their old-timey tales. To be honest, the experience isn’t describable, and I didn’t even attempt to take pictures. But some of our cruft are better at words and cameras than me, so here are some of those who responded to me. Michael C ’16 Here in Dallas, the cloud forecast was looking gloomy all month and up to the morning of April 8. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time staring at the blue and gray contours of satellite weather imagery and learning the difference between GFS, ECMWF, and NAM. But like magic, 8 minutes before totality the clouds totally dissipated and we had perfect views of the eclipse. In these images you can see ruby-colored solar prominences, planet-sized loops of plasma hanging off the sun. You can also see Bailey’s Beads right on the edge of the eclipse, caused by rugged craters on the moon’s surface. Truly a magical experience that you have to see in person. (Minor digression: through a stroke of luck, my car rental reservation for a sedan was upgraded to an enormous fuel-guzzling pickup truck. As a Californian who normally drives a pragmatic efficient EV I’ve now been radicalized to being a Truck Guy, much to the chagrin of my wife Steph C ’15). An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Caroline M. ’18 Had lots of clouds, but got to see it last min!! My coworker made it into album art and it gives *Halloween* An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Laura N. ’09 These days I am a high school science teacher. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to travel to the path of totality and I didn’t take any pictures, but I did collect temperature and cloud data for NASA with the Globe Observer citizen science project. This graph shows the temperature change experienced at my location, which saw about 93% coverage. I’ll be using this in my classes in a few weeks to introduce radiation heat transfer to my physics students! Lydia K. ’14, MEng ’16 My partner Cory ’13 and his high school friend Robert and I roadtripped to Bangor, Maine, to see totality in Millinocket, Maine. In total we drove (well, Robert drove; I worked in the back of the car and Cory played Mario and Rabbids) 12 hours, including four there, four back, and four in traffic from Millinocket back to Bangor. We hiked in the snow during the eclipse leading up to totality, squinting up at the sun getting eaten by the moon like a cookie through eclipse glasses and the Celestron 12x50mm solar binoculars I’d bought for the occasion (one of the very last two from Walmart online, the other of which went to my dad for his birthday). Robert and Cory had rescued a guy whose car got stuck in the snow-mud, and he and his dog Radar hiked with us until they got to their eclipse-watching spot. When we got back to the car, another guy’s car was stuck in the snow-mud, but he was embarrassed and didn’t want help. We watched the rest of the lead-up from the car, and then, when it started getting dark, from outside. It got dark, and grey, but not like at sunset, and sharp shadows came out, not at all like the soft shadows at sunset. It got cold. I put on my sweater (it had been t-shirt weather all day) and then my jacket over it. We could see planets shining in the sky. Everyone was quiet; even the sound of traffic was gone. Dogs barked. The actual event was extraordinary. It was like everyone here describes it, and it looked just like the photos in this blog post. It was worth the drive.

'26 Anika H. '26 Course 6-1 [email protected] Biography Hi! I’m currently a ‘26, living in East Campus. While I hang around most halls on the East parallel, I’m often lounging around in the Tetazoo kitchen, setting hand sanitizer on fire or trying to pet the cats. I come from Bay Area California and have never seen wild bunnies in such a large quantity. I to catch them so bad, but I can’t because they’re bunnies. When I was a small gremlin, I wanted to be rich so I could plant a forest in the middle of a city. I used to spend a ton of time outdoors, and became very proficient at catching bugs, spiders, and lizards. Within the first two weeks of getting here, I have caught a cockroach, a katydid (who I named Greg), and two craneflies (those gangly things that look like giant mosquitos) on campus. I can cook exactly 2 and a half of my family’s dishes, but haven’t gotten anything other than a 20-pound bag of rice so far, which I had to haul up several flights of stairs because East Campus doesn’t have elevators. But that was nice because I do need exercise. My kerb is a weird combination of letters and numbers because I’m a ham radio nerd and used my call sign instead of my name. I like building things, so I hang around Radio Society, MITERS, and a bunch of the makerspaces. I really like art! I draw a lot, as you will probably see from my blog posts. I do digital art, traditional stuff (I like charcoal), and outdoor sketching. I also doodle and can draw cursed fanart on demand.

'27 'twas the night before cpw... April 10, 2024 in Advice , CPW Last week, my photo gallery reminded me that roughly one year ago was my CPW! Interspaced between pictures of Boston and campus were other assorted pictures—midnight karaoke, bleached hair, and lots, lots, lots of free food—that reminded me how much I enjoyed exploring MIT for the first time as a prospective student. In light of it being the night before CPW, I wanted to highlight a few pieces of general advice I had :) Explore the different dorms! I knew I wanted to live in Burton-Conner as soon as I went on a dorm tour during CPW. It helped me get a sense of all the important details, such as the living space, community, distance from campus, etc. Each floor in Burton-Conner also has a different culture (which you can read about more here ), so you can also visit each floor’s events! For example, my floor is holding a few events ⁠ 01 shameless plug in our flounge: ⁠ 02 floor + lounge = flounge Studio Ghibli Movie Night (4/11 @ 10:00pm) Pottery and Paint (4/12 @ 6:30pm): ⁠ 03 I'm hosting this with my roommate! Come say hi and paint with us :) In Burton-Conner Porter Room as part of the BC Bonanza! Super Smash Bros & Other Games (4/12 @ 8:00pm) Nail Salon & Build a Pirate Ship (4/13 @ 4:00pm) Go to Midway! Nearly everyone goes to Midway, so this is kind-of a CPW given, but Midway features student group booths to show student life culture at MIT. Each booth will have club members there, so you have the opportunity to ask any questions about the club or MIT life in general. There’s also lots of free merch, like t-shirts, stickers, ⁠ 04 I think I took like 30+ stickers back home after Midway tote bags, and snacks. This year, I’m on the other side of Midway and helping to run the MIT Society of Women Engineers Chapter and MIT Student Events Board booth. Throughout CPW, there will also be other academic booths set-up by different departments to talk about their research, classes, and program offerings. I actually learned about MIT’s Washington DC Internship Program through one of the undergraduates at a Course 17 booth, which is what I’m doing this summer! Alsooo, go to community-specific events! A lot of clubs will hold CPW events for you to get to know the members of a certain community in a casual, fun way! Nearly every sorority, fraternity, and independent living group hosts CPW events for you all to talk to current members and start thinking about if you want to join one of their communities. For me, I went to one of FLI@MIT ‘s events last year, and I remember it was nice being able to ask students questions in a less formal setting than a traditional Q&A panel. Would highly recommend exploring the different communities on campus and asking students any specific questions you have while you’re there :) On that note, talk to new people! I spent a majority of my CPW talking and going to events with people I already knew, but I wish I had spent more time meeting new people and asking questions instead. You’d be surprised at how many people you meet for the first time that you end up seeing again (and it’s also nice to meet and talk to so many different people in a casual environment)! For example, I talked to someone one time at CPW because we were hosted in the same suite. We both now live on floor C4 now :0 …but also don’t burn yourself out <3 Towards the end of CPW, I was really tired. This isn’t a universal experience—a lot of my friends spent every moment of CPW at an event, talking to people, or doing something around Boston, and they really enjoyed it. For me, though, I wish I took more time to decompress, so also make sure to take care of yourself in the rush of CPW :’) Lightning round advice from the Class of 2027: “Don’t let the rain ruin the vibe, we promise you’ll grow to like the rain (hopefully)” ⁠ 05 better yet, take advantage of the rain and treat killian like a slip-and-slide (don't do this) “Walk around Boston and take at least one sunset picture by the bridge” “Go to events even if you’re not sure you’ll join the club. I ended up joining a lot of clubs I wasn’t initially interested in!” “Highly recommend trying Mike’s Pastries and Toscanini’s” “Go on a lab tour! They are very fun, and you can usually talk to the lab’s professor about their work if you’re particularly interested :)” In short: have fun, come prepared with a raincoat or umbrella ⁠ 06 or brave the rain like I did when I lost my umbrella for a week last semester before caving and buying a new one , picture yourself on campus, talk to new people and upperclassmen, try new things, walk around Boston, take breaks when you need to, and eat lots of free food. Welcome to campus! By the last day of CPW, I was already mentally committed to MIT for the next four years, and I hope you all will feel the same :) shameless plug ⁠ back to text ↑ floor + lounge = flounge ⁠ back to text ↑ I'm hosting this with my roommate!

'27 Jessica Z. '27 Undeclared [email protected] Biography Hi! I’m Jessica, a first-year student living in Burton-Conner with an ever-growing (1,245 and counting) amount of notes app entries on my phone, which hopefully explains my love for writing. At MIT, I’m planning to study Course 20 and Course 15-1 (biological engineering and business management), but I’m interested in lots of other fields, like public policy, design, and sustainability. When I’m not in the classroom or exploring the BioMaker Space, I enjoy baking cute desserts, watching studio ghibli movies, and going on night walks with friends. I’m an avid stationary connoisseur, strawberry pocky enthusiast, and boba lover; I also love creating different forms of art through painting, bullet journaling, and origami. I’m originally from Jim Thorpe, a small town in Pennsylvania that holds a special place in my heart. I also went to a super small high school with a graduating class of twenty-four students—needless to say, I have a lot to get used to in Boston and at MIT. I’m admittedly nervous about many aspects of college but equally excited to learn, and I can’t wait to share my discoveries of all the hidden gems that make MIT, MIT. *:･ﾟ✧ Recent Posts Welcome to CPW!

'27 'twas the night before cpw... April 10, 2024 in Advice , CPW Last week, my photo gallery reminded me that roughly one year ago was my CPW! Interspaced between pictures of Boston and campus were other assorted pictures—midnight karaoke, bleached hair, and lots, lots, lots of free food—that reminded me how much I enjoyed exploring MIT for the first time as a prospective student. In light of it being the night before CPW, I wanted to highlight a few pieces of general advice I had :) Explore the different dorms! I knew I wanted to live in Burton-Conner as soon as I went on a dorm tour during CPW. It helped me get a sense of all the important details, such as the living space, community, distance from campus, etc. Each floor in Burton-Conner also has a different culture (which you can read about more here ), so you can also visit each floor’s events! For example, my floor is holding a few events ⁠ 01 shameless plug in our flounge: ⁠ 02 floor + lounge = flounge Studio Ghibli Movie Night (4/11 @ 10:00pm) Pottery and Paint (4/12 @ 6:30pm): ⁠ 03 I'm hosting this with my roommate! Come say hi and paint with us :) In Burton-Conner Porter Room as part of the BC Bonanza! Super Smash Bros & Other Games (4/12 @ 8:00pm) Nail Salon & Build a Pirate Ship (4/13 @ 4:00pm) Go to Midway! Nearly everyone goes to Midway, so this is kind-of a CPW given, but Midway features student group booths to show student life culture at MIT. Each booth will have club members there, so you have the opportunity to ask any questions about the club or MIT life in general. There’s also lots of free merch, like t-shirts, stickers, ⁠ 04 I think I took like 30+ stickers back home after Midway tote bags, and snacks. This year, I’m on the other side of Midway and helping to run the MIT Society of Women Engineers Chapter and MIT Student Events Board booth. Throughout CPW, there will also be other academic booths set-up by different departments to talk about their research, classes, and program offerings. I actually learned about MIT’s Washington DC Internship Program through one of the undergraduates at a Course 17 booth, which is what I’m doing this summer! Alsooo, go to community-specific events! A lot of clubs will hold CPW events for you to get to know the members of a certain community in a casual, fun way! Nearly every sorority, fraternity, and independent living group hosts CPW events for you all to talk to current members and start thinking about if you want to join one of their communities. For me, I went to one of FLI@MIT ‘s events last year, and I remember it was nice being able to ask students questions in a less formal setting than a traditional Q&A panel. Would highly recommend exploring the different communities on campus and asking students any specific questions you have while you’re there :) On that note, talk to new people! I spent a majority of my CPW talking and going to events with people I already knew, but I wish I had spent more time meeting new people and asking questions instead. You’d be surprised at how many people you meet for the first time that you end up seeing again (and it’s also nice to meet and talk to so many different people in a casual environment)! For example, I talked to someone one time at CPW because we were hosted in the same suite. We both now live on floor C4 now :0 …but also don’t burn yourself out <3 Towards the end of CPW, I was really tired. This isn’t a universal experience—a lot of my friends spent every moment of CPW at an event, talking to people, or doing something around Boston, and they really enjoyed it. For me, though, I wish I took more time to decompress, so also make sure to take care of yourself in the rush of CPW :’) Lightning round advice from the Class of 2027: “Don’t let the rain ruin the vibe, we promise you’ll grow to like the rain (hopefully)” ⁠ 05 better yet, take advantage of the rain and treat killian like a slip-and-slide (don't do this) “Walk around Boston and take at least one sunset picture by the bridge” “Go to events even if you’re not sure you’ll join the club. I ended up joining a lot of clubs I wasn’t initially interested in!” “Highly recommend trying Mike’s Pastries and Toscanini’s” “Go on a lab tour! They are very fun, and you can usually talk to the lab’s professor about their work if you’re particularly interested :)” In short: have fun, come prepared with a raincoat or umbrella ⁠ 06 or brave the rain like I did when I lost my umbrella for a week last semester before caving and buying a new one , picture yourself on campus, talk to new people and upperclassmen, try new things, walk around Boston, take breaks when you need to, and eat lots of free food. Welcome to campus! By the last day of CPW, I was already mentally committed to MIT for the next four years, and I hope you all will feel the same :) shameless plug ⁠ back to text ↑ floor + lounge = flounge ⁠ back to text ↑ I'm hosting this with my roommate!

'26 April 7, 2024 in Uncategorized finding place Note: these are some retrospective thoughts on my experiences finding place at MIT. I reflected back on the patterns and evolutions, but in the moment I mostly don’t think about this stuff consciously. I haven’t posted in a while. Too long. It’s been one of the semesters. MIT has taught me a lot of things about community. I was in a small high school, and although I made good friends, I always felt a bit isolated within my technical interests. When I got to MIT, looking back I think I felt like I was a little kid walking into his first candy store. I was astounded by all these people with whom I had a lot of shared technical context/passions, organized into all these different colorful communities. Here are some pics, looking back (omitting a lot because I don’t want to personally identify anyone) bacon quesadilla ramen hike with friend At the same time, it was a hard semester for me due to all the life changes of being frosh (first sem is hard!) and a challenging math class. So I spent the social time I had everywhere and nowhere. Dashing around, not sticking around long enough to build anything solid, with some lucky exceptions. You can’t rely on serendipitously bumping into people at university and a huge campus. You need to be more intentional, unless they literally live next to you. I was not on top of things and was mostly unaware of how things were playing out. I remember, during IAP (Independent Activities Period), I was out watching the stars with a good friend when he called me out and said man, you need to be careful because last semester you came into some people’s lives for a quick burst and then flaked out . I am very grateful for that call out. He put himself out there and give me an outside persective that was very important. I had been volatile. On the other hand, that period was also illuminating. It gave me perspective on MIT; the different scenes, as well as the type of people I want to hang out with. And that there many people I’d like to see but won’t have the capacity to make it happen unless they do. At the end of fall semester I was starting to feel tired of some of these shallow things and had met people I really appreciated. But then I got hosedddddddddd in the spring. The people I interacted with became a small group of friends and the people I would work with. Many of the latter became the former (MIT students would utter the words trauma bonding , I won’t go that far). Community got submerged. I don’t recommend doing that, but it did teach me my limits. Some pics: galois math montreal for spring break boston cruise physics symmetries Finally, spring ended (and with it the hosure), summer passed, fall rolled around, East Campus closed, and I moved to Burton Conner (these are two different dorms) with a good roommate. I had more time, and I was definitely no longer wanting to explore as much. So I got closer to some. But my friends are spread out and my interactions were one on one. It’s a lot of effort sometimes though! It means you mostly have to interact with people through focused conversations or situations where you’re using your brain and talking about life. went to rave party in room I threw a party in my room with roommate! This was really interesting. It was spontaneous but fun. Throwing a good party is really exhilarating and in general putting on events where your friends meet each other/grow the cohesion to turn into a group is nice. Now, I live in Pika . Pika is very fun, and I feel at home. I’m trying to do more outings and have a bit of a group going on, which is great. This semester I went to Mexico with some besties. pyramids cricket taco Nearing the end of my second year, I have a much stronger sense of place at MIT. This happened mostly through just putting myself out there and trying to bring people together to do fun stuff. For example, a few days ago, a friend and I decided we wanted to drive down for the eclipse so we hit up some other people and now it’s happening. I am much more grounded and maybe less socially excited than that bright eyed kid freshamn fall. But I still feel the wonder of this place. I know myself and where I am, a bit more.

I used to live in EC, and am now in BC, and I spend a lot of time at Pika. I want to walk with people, listen to music and look around at the world to understand it. I like building software that allows people to do new things. I think building intelligent and safe agents is a fascinating problem that I'll work on for a while. I like mathematics because it feels like a space where you are allowed to just sit in the void and think about something for a long time, and that can actually be very aesthetic. aesthetics are fun. thinking about awareness and where i draw my meaning has helped me grow a lot. I like meeting people who are curious and reflective and bring me to different ways of understanding the world. Here's a portrait of myself through my music taste: *Postcards from the Road, Tom Adams*, *Tech Noir by Gunship*, *Let the bad times roll by The Offspring*, *God Moving over the face of the water by Vikingur Olafsson*, *Candyman Revisited by Philip Glass*, *Believe by Eminem*, *Civilisation de Orelsan*.

I spent my time there playing drums, making board games, and cookin’ pizza at my local pizzeria. I don’t know what I want to do in the future, but when asked as a 10 year old, I told the class I wanted to work at Party City and that isn’t totally off the table yet. I’m thinking about majoring in Course 2A, but dropping out and enrolling in Clown College (Harvard) isn’t looking too bad… I like bad movies, New Zealand Indie Rock, and just about anything Charlie Brown. I’ve played percussion for the last eight years, and I was once in a band called “Willy Nilly and the Black Friday Crowd,” but that’s a story for another time. I’m a Christian, and now I’m part of Cru, which is pretty cool. At my old church, we used to compete at the AG National Fine Arts Festival, and I once built a replica of King Solomon’s temple entirely out of playing cards. It was pretty neat, until it fell down…twice. I wanted to be a blogger because I remember how impactful the blogs were when I was applying to MIT, and I want to encourage future applicants to pursue their dreams. But in all honesty, this blog will probably be a continuous stream of random stories inevitably relating to Australian Survivor, loose references to philosophy articles I read senior year, and obscure Charlie Brown references.

'25 spring break in nova scotia, nyc, and dc March 31, 2024 in Personal Travel the spring force, as expressed by Hooke’s Law This past spring quarter, I felt like a spring. Specifically, like an undamped oscillator. My days swung wildly up and down. The more I pushed myself, the greater response force I’d feel on my energy levels. Calmness remained at a distance. But, as I approached spring break, assignments finally wound down and days became less packed. My graph dampened into a steady state. Nine days of spring break: what to do with them? I feel like I’ve experienced both ends of activity levels: doing all the things and doing mostly nothing. Last year, my friends and I packed our bags for a bustling East Coast adventure. This year, we went on a Canadian road trip and spent our days chilling in the woods. Here are the tales of how both of these trips came together: 2023: New York, NY and Washington, DC Last spring, we (Asal V. ‘25, Caitlin O. ‘25, Isaac L. ‘25, and I) had an ambitiously packed schedule. Our agenda came together by reaction. During the winter, I found out through the news that the Phantom of the Opera, the longest running Broadway show of all time, was ending its 35-year run. So, we booked tickets and set on going to New York to catch the production in its final days. That was all we planned to do. But then… A few weeks after making that decision, I got an email that I originally thought was a phishing scam but was actually a message from the White House. I think I had reason to raise an eyebrow because it requested for sensitive information like my social security number. I even forwarded it to my friends to ask if they, too, thought the email was suspicious. The email was an invitation to Washington, DC for a celebration of the team that worked on the 2020 Biden Presidential Campaign. Back then, I worked as a Community Organizing Fellow and, later on, Data Analyst for my home state of Nevada. I was really thrown off by the email because it came 2.5 years after my time on the team but, I guess, made sense because COVID-19 had finally become manageable. I was allowed to bring a few guests, so spring break made the most logistical sense. Suddenly, our group was tasked with hitting two major cities of the East Coast. Day 1 (3/24, Friday): Drive to New York We (and by “we” I mean Caitlin) ⁠ 01 She‘s such a pro at driving. Also, Isaac wants me to add that he drove, like, 10% of it. drove from Boston to New York. I always enjoy long car rides with my friends. We blast tunes, indulge in snacks, and share stories. Some of my best laughs have happened while sitting in the back of a mini-van, slightly delirious from being in one space for such a long time. Every ride feels the same—like home. Day 2 (3/25, Saturday): Broadway Our one big thing, which was the impetus for this leg of the trip, was to see Phantom of the Opera that evening. It felt like we were just filling in the rest of the day with things in anticipation of the show. We… Explored the Google store because Caitlin is a Google fanatic Bought an Apple Airtag to stow in our car because we were paranoid the car would be stolen. We were staying in the cheapest reasonable Airbnb we could find, which meant being in a sketchy neighborhood. Visited Stonewall Inn for fun Thrifted some fun clothing pieces at the Buffalo Exchange Stocked up on stationary at MUJI Saw Phantom of the Opera <3!!! Caitlin and I saw Phantom while Isaac and Asal elected to see Hamilton . Phantom was simply breathtaking. Day 3 (3/26, Sunday): Comedy Show We had a more-chill day after such a packed day prior. We… Ate fantastic Malaysian food Walked the High Line , which is a beautiful train track turned public walkway Tagged along with Isaac to B&H , a film store, because he needed something for his camera. There was a really cool open transportation system in the ceiling where you could put a package into a machine on one end of the store and have it transported to the other. Naively sat in the front row of Sunday Sqool Comedy , a comedy show by Ashley Gavin (who used to work at MIT!), during which Isaac got roasted. We all had watched her TikToks and were amazed we got to see her in-person. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 4 (3/27, Monday): Quintessential NYC This was our last day in New York, so we made sure to check off quintessential New York activities. We… Ate lunch with MIT Concourse professors and staff Perused the MET Strolled Central Park Visited the 9/11 Memorial Wandered The Oculus , a mall inside the World Trade Center Had dinner in Chinatown An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Then, Cait drove us to Washington, DC, we settled into our new home for a few days, and drifted off to bed. Day 5 (3/28, Tuesday): White House The scheduling for our White House visit had a short, rigid time window, so the planning of this leg of the trip revolved around it. We came in aware that most museums—even the really huge ones—are free, so had a full-on museum day. We… Toured the White House . It was very cool to be able to actually walk inside after hearing about it our entire lives. It’s kinda small when you compare it to other Washington buildings. Ate breakfast at Founding Farmers DC Met up with our MIT friend Jade D. ‘25 and enjoyed the cherry blossoms . This time of year was peak bloom, so it was especially nice to see the flowers. Visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture Visited the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Visited the Washington National Cathedral the green room! the red room! jade! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 6 (3/29, Wednesday): Museums The weather was beautiful, so we decided to spend much of this day outdoors and soak it all in. We… Visited the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Visited the National Gallery of Art Went paddleboarding in Tidal Basin Frolicked in tulip gardens at the Floral Library Laid in the grass in front of the Washington Monument Perused the Lincoln Monument we split up bc cait and i wanted to paddleboard some more hehe isaac took this very ~dramatic~ photo An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 7 (3/30, Thursday): Capitol Tour Several months ahead of our trip, I contacted my Congressional representative to see if they could show my friends and I around. Their office kindly arranged for one of their staff members to give us a private tour, which was the centerpiece of our day. We… Toured the US Capitol , during which we also got to go inside the House Chamber !!! ⁠ 02 fyi no photos were allowed We didn’t realize that was part of the tour. It was surreal. My policy minor heart was pumping. Politicians that we normally only saw in news articles and videos were now right in front of us. The only thing between us and them was air. We even got to watch them vote and actually pass something. It was especially cool watching what groups they self-arranged in. I also didn’t fully understand that the house reps work together in the same big room. Like, they are working physically near their closest colleagues and fiercest opponents. We could’ve spent all day watching the chamber in action, but had to move on with our days. Stopped by the S tatue of Liberty , per Asal’s request, on our drive back to Boston. isaac took another very ~dramatic~ photo An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next We did so much and had so much fun but, boy, were we so tired. I’m glad we embarked on the journey together, but made a mental note to bring it down a few notches the following year. 2024: Nova Scotia, Canada We learned our lesson from last year. We needed to take an actual break. Instead of doing many things, we decided to do essentially nothing. This year, we were the same crew plus Malachi M. ‘25! While planning for our trip, we searched for places we could get to by car and that were more woodsy. We’re more of a “cute cabin in the foggy forest” type-of-crowd than an “island beach getaway” type-of-crowd, at least for this year. A week prior to our planning meet-up, I discovered the song You’re So Vain by Carly Simon and Malachi discovered the song Fire & Flame by The Longest Johns, both of which were respectively our first exposures to the name “Nova Scotia.” I volunteered the idea of this place and, after ruminating amongst our options, we decided to take the province on. Our group found an adorable A-frame cottage tucked in the woods and right up next to a lake. Off to Canada we went… Day 1 (3/25, Monday): Drive to Nova Scotia We underestimated our endurance for the long drive. Google Maps said it would take 11.5 hours but, with our food stops and border control in-between, it took us 15 hours to get there. The drive up was beautiful: wistful fog that faded into endless rows of trees, soft rain trickling down, and an orange sun that gleamed in quaint ponds. When we reached the province of Nova Scotia, I frequently turned my head to look around, only finding endless darkness trailing behind us. It was opaquely black. We were, indeed, deep in the woods. I kept thinking “wow, this would be a good place to get murdered right now” which, of course, did not happen. I also kept finding myself thinking happy thoughts about my friends. Despite all the cold and foreignness of the weather around us, we were safe in our little pocket of warmth. In that car was an air of comfort and love. When not singing songs or telling tales, I looked around the car and thought about reasons why I loved each individual person. I’m really thankful for my friends. We eventually arrived around 3am, ⁠ 03 2am Boston time because we had a time zone shift unloaded our car, and immediately knocked out. i brought a voltage tester (which lights up when its top and bottom are connected to a complete circuit) for fun and isaac held it to his head what the cottage looked like (pulled from the listing bc our photos did not do it justice) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 2 (3/26, Tuesday): Errands Because of our late arrival, we woke up very late the next day. We felt hungry and wanted to spend most of the day in, so we went to a diner, Walmart, and headed back home. The American diner was… questionable. It was inside of a gas station and took up half of the building’s interior. I think the youngest customer aside from us was probably in their 60s. We felt somewhat watched by everyone else because we were a young, diverse group, but not in a bad way. Just an “oh that’s new” kind of way. At Walmart , we spent too much time searching for basic foods. The girlies who live in cook-for-yourself dorms volunteered to cook dinner: Cait for today and Asal for tomorrow. After we got all food ingredients and some firewood, we headed back home. That night, we played Tetris and Street Fighter on Isaac’s Raspberry Pi, ate Penne a la Vodka pasta prepared by Cait, and watched Nimona on an outdoor movie projector while soaking in the Airbnb jacuzzi . I slept well that night. the outdoor theater set up (pulled from the listing bc we didn't take a photo ourselves) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 3 (3/27, Wednesday): Lounging Around We planned to go out and then we didn’t. We, once again, woke up quite late. So late that we pushed our plans to go out to Halifax, the main city in Nova Scotia, to the following day. The only “outing” we had was visiting the nearest convenience store, buying firewood , and coming back home. Day 4 (3/28, Thursday): City of Halifax We planned to go out and then we actually did! We… Ate lunch at Gangnam Korean BBQ Visited the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site Grabbed pastries from Pan e Circo per recommendation by Isaac’s cousin, who works for the city of Halifax. Tasted ciders at Bulwark Cider House & Cafe per recommendation by Ceri Riley ’16 . I knew she had been to Nova Scotia before, so I asked her for recs before we embarked on our trip. Though we couldn’t pursue most of the recs because we were staying in a different area that she was in, I’m glad we were able to check off one place. Went on a nature walk at Point Pleasant Ate dinner at an Italian place Played video games at home Watched Poor Things isaac tying his shoe looked kinda funny here sorry for the nature walk through the rain xd An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next they look so cute 🥺 Day 5 (3/29, Friday): Drive back to MIT I’m currently sitting in the back of the car typing this out. This morning, we checked out at 11am and headed on our route home. Our ride so far has been mostly the same as the way in, but the fog is absolutely insane. I’m impressed by Cait’s driving. The fog was so dense that, at times, we could barely see beyond a few feet in front of the car. Snow started to heavily pour down after we passed the border. We’re 4 hours from home. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next On arrival, we’ll be dropped off one-by-one at our dorms and return to our normal, academic lives. We’ll miss the time we’ve had, though we’ll still continue to see each other basically every day. Travelling has a way of bonding friends: you experience the new with the old—foreign sights with familiar people. We’ll leave this trip with stories. As the sludge of the final stretch of the semester catches up to us, I’m confident that we will, together, make it through the oscillations of this coming spring.

Let’s travel around. Where should we head? Perhaps to Thailand, where my family is originally from. We can wade in the soft teal waters, indulge in the tasty delights of street markets, and come to understand why it’s dubbed the “Land of Smiles.” Maybe we can go back in time to my gap year, when I learned 2 songs on the guitar, underwent a 10-day silent meditation retreat, and other fun pursuits. I enjoy leaning into my intuition and letting its ideas come to fruition whenever I can. Next stop will be my dorm: Simmons (previously, I lived at East Campus, but it’s currently undergoing renovation). Here, you can find me doing mechanical engineering things (building stuff) and political science things (thinking too much about stuff), especially because I’m studying both. When I find small time pockets in the day, I enjoy experimenting with tea mixology and playing with polyhedral puzzles. One thing I like to do at night is firespin with my rope dart and dragon staff. One thing I like to do during the day is ride my bike, lovingly named Saph, aimlessly through the winding streets of Boston. I’ll keep my favorite place on campus to myself, but I’ll at least take you to my second favorite: Guennette, 1977. It’s a quiet, geometric sculpture that lives in the heart of Killian Court. We could sit there at midday and gaze in awe of the Charles River calmly coursing in juxtaposition with the bustling campus. Complete stillness. Isn’t it lovely? Alright. I’m not sure where we’re headed next, but I hope you relish the ride. Recent Posts F=-kx spring break in nova scotia, nyc, and dc by Kanokwan T.

Day 5 (3/28, Tuesday): White House The scheduling for our White House visit had a short, rigid time window, so the planning of this leg of the trip revolved around it. We came in aware that most museums—even the really huge ones—are free, so had a full-on museum day. We… Toured the White House . It was very cool to be able to actually walk inside after hearing about it our entire lives. It’s kinda small when you compare it to other Washington buildings. Ate breakfast at Founding Farmers DC Met up with our MIT friend Jade D. ‘25 and enjoyed the cherry blossoms . This time of year was peak bloom, so it was especially nice to see the flowers. Visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture Visited the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Visited the Washington National Cathedral the green room! the red room! jade! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 6 (3/29, Wednesday): Museums The weather was beautiful, so we decided to spend much of this day outdoors and soak it all in. We… Visited the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Visited the National Gallery of Art Went paddleboarding in Tidal Basin Frolicked in tulip gardens at the Floral Library Laid in the grass in front of the Washington Monument Perused the Lincoln Monument we split up bc cait and i wanted to paddleboard some more hehe isaac took this very ~dramatic~ photo An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 7 (3/30, Thursday): Capitol Tour Several months ahead of our trip, I contacted my Congressional representative to see if they could show my friends and I around. Their office kindly arranged for one of their staff members to give us a private tour, which was the centerpiece of our day. We… Toured the US Capitol , during which we also got to go inside the House Chamber !!! ⁠ 02 fyi no photos were allowed We didn’t realize that was part of the tour. It was surreal. My policy minor heart was pumping. Politicians that we normally only saw in news articles and videos were now right in front of us. The only thing between us and them was air. We even got to watch them vote and actually pass something. It was especially cool watching what groups they self-arranged in. I also didn’t fully understand that the house reps work together in the same big room. Like, they are working physically near their closest colleagues and fiercest opponents. We could’ve spent all day watching the chamber in action, but had to move on with our days. Stopped by the S tatue of Liberty , per Asal’s request, on our drive back to Boston. isaac took another very ~dramatic~ photo An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next We did so much and had so much fun but, boy, were we so tired. I’m glad we embarked on the journey together, but made a mental note to bring it down a few notches the following year. 2024: Nova Scotia, Canada We learned our lesson from last year. We needed to take an actual break. Instead of doing many things, we decided to do essentially nothing. This year, we were the same crew plus Malachi M. ‘25! While planning for our trip, we searched for places we could get to by car and that were more woodsy. We’re more of a “cute cabin in the foggy forest” type-of-crowd than an “island beach getaway” type-of-crowd, at least for this year. A week prior to our planning meet-up, I discovered the song You’re So Vain by Carly Simon and Malachi discovered the song Fire & Flame by The Longest Johns, both of which were respectively our first exposures to the name “Nova Scotia.” I volunteered the idea of this place and, after ruminating amongst our options, we decided to take the province on. Our group found an adorable A-frame cottage tucked in the woods and right up next to a lake. Off to Canada we went… Day 1 (3/25, Monday): Drive to Nova Scotia We underestimated our endurance for the long drive. Google Maps said it would take 11.5 hours but, with our food stops and border control in-between, it took us 15 hours to get there. The drive up was beautiful: wistful fog that faded into endless rows of trees, soft rain trickling down, and an orange sun that gleamed in quaint ponds. When we reached the province of Nova Scotia, I frequently turned my head to look around, only finding endless darkness trailing behind us. It was opaquely black. We were, indeed, deep in the woods. I kept thinking “wow, this would be a good place to get murdered right now” which, of course, did not happen. I also kept finding myself thinking happy thoughts about my friends. Despite all the cold and foreignness of the weather around us, we were safe in our little pocket of warmth. In that car was an air of comfort and love. When not singing songs or telling tales, I looked around the car and thought about reasons why I loved each individual person. I’m really thankful for my friends. We eventually arrived around 3am, ⁠ 03 2am Boston time because we had a time zone shift unloaded our car, and immediately knocked out. i brought a voltage tester (which lights up when its top and bottom are connected to a complete circuit) for fun and isaac held it to his head what the cottage looked like (pulled from the listing bc our photos did not do it justice) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 2 (3/26, Tuesday): Errands Because of our late arrival, we woke up very late the next day. We felt hungry and wanted to spend most of the day in, so we went to a diner, Walmart, and headed back home. The American diner was… questionable. It was inside of a gas station and took up half of the building’s interior. I think the youngest customer aside from us was probably in their 60s. We felt somewhat watched by everyone else because we were a young, diverse group, but not in a bad way. Just an “oh that’s new” kind of way. At Walmart , we spent too much time searching for basic foods. The girlies who live in cook-for-yourself dorms volunteered to cook dinner: Cait for today and Asal for tomorrow. After we got all food ingredients and some firewood, we headed back home. That night, we played Tetris and Street Fighter on Isaac’s Raspberry Pi, ate Penne a la Vodka pasta prepared by Cait, and watched Nimona on an outdoor movie projector while soaking in the Airbnb jacuzzi . I slept well that night. the outdoor theater set up (pulled from the listing bc we didn't take a photo ourselves) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Day 3 (3/27, Wednesday): Lounging Around We planned to go out and then we didn’t. We, once again, woke up quite late. So late that we pushed our plans to go out to Halifax, the main city in Nova Scotia, to the following day. The only “outing” we had was visiting the nearest convenience store, buying firewood , and coming back home. Day 4 (3/28, Thursday): City of Halifax We planned to go out and then we actually did! We… Ate lunch at Gangnam Korean BBQ Visited the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site Grabbed pastries from Pan e Circo per recommendation by Isaac’s cousin, who works for the city of Halifax. Tasted ciders at Bulwark Cider House & Cafe per recommendation by Ceri Riley ’16 . I knew she had been to Nova Scotia before, so I asked her for recs before we embarked on our trip. Though we couldn’t pursue most of the recs because we were staying in a different area that she was in, I’m glad we were able to check off one place. Went on a nature walk at Point Pleasant Ate dinner at an Italian place Played video games at home Watched Poor Things isaac tying his shoe looked kinda funny here sorry for the nature walk through the rain xd An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next they look so cute 🥺 Day 5 (3/29, Friday): Drive back to MIT I’m currently sitting in the back of the car typing this out. This morning, we checked out at 11am and headed on our route home. Our ride so far has been mostly the same as the way in, but the fog is absolutely insane. I’m impressed by Cait’s driving. The fog was so dense that, at times, we could barely see beyond a few feet in front of the car. Snow started to heavily pour down after we passed the border. We’re 4 hours from home. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next On arrival, we’ll be dropped off one-by-one at our dorms and return to our normal, academic lives. We’ll miss the time we’ve had, though we’ll still continue to see each other basically every day. Travelling has a way of bonding friends: you experience the new with the old—foreign sights with familiar people. We’ll leave this trip with stories. As the sludge of the final stretch of the semester catches up to us, I’m confident that we will, together, make it through the oscillations of this coming spring. Post Tagged #canada #dc #nyc #spring #spring break She‘s such a pro at driving. Also, Isaac wants me to add that he drove, like, 10% of it. ⁠ back to text ↑ fyi no photos were allowed ⁠ back to text ↑ 2am Boston time because we had a time zone shift ⁠ back to text ↑ Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

'26 and what led up to it! March 28, 2024 in Events , MIT History & Culture , MIT Life ★ a recounting of Premiere (Oops, it’s been like 1.5 months since) Ring Premiere happened! For almost a year now, I’ve had the privilege of being on the Class of 2026 Ring Committee! Ring Committee, also known as RingComm, is a group of twelve students tasked with designing the Brass Rat for their class. If you don’t already know, the Brass Rat is a class ring that MIT undergraduates receive at the end of their second year. It has an extensive history (that I won’t go into but you can read about it here and here ) and has made appearances on the fingers of Tony Stark, the John Harvard statue, and soon, my classmates. In the several months leading up to Premiere, RingComm had been moving in silence. standing on business, even. working on the ring design in private. In order to ensure the secrecy of the design until Premiere, we even resorted to taping CVS pharmacy receipts and crumpled pset packets over the door window of the classroom where we’d meet twice a week. But on February 10th, it was finally time to unveil the design to the entire class! The day started off rather unassuming. For the first few hours, my tasks consisted of lugging boxes of t-shirts and toothpick holders, ⁠ 01 i wasn't talking about shot glasses at all. why would you even think that. blowing up balloons and fluffing up decorative pom-poms, and testing how far I could reasonably chuck various mini beaver Squishmallows into the auditorium seats. By 5pm, we’d finished running through our dress rehearsals and setting up decorations. All that was left for the committee was to get changed and get hyped. At 6:30pm, doors opened. I was holed up backstage as my classmates were filtering into Kresge Auditorium, but I could slowly hear the ambient sounds get louder and rowdier as more and more people filed in. At some point, I poked my head out to assess the crowd situation, and saw various greek life/living communities and friend groups dressed in funky hats and group costumes, as is custom for Premiere. Finally, at 7:05pm, lights dimmed to outrageous cheer. This year RingComm tried something a little new for Premiere – we filmed short little video skits to play before each duo walked on stage to present. By the time Hailey P. ‘26 and Sean H. ‘26, our Co-Premiere chairs, walked on stage to kick us off with the Hacker’s Map, the decibel levels in the room were insane. Shrieks and hollers broke out every half a sentence, and the crowd only got louder as the presentation progressed. Sabrina C. ‘26 and Jamie O. ‘26 were up next with the Cambridge and Boston skylines, followed by Nathan K. ‘26 and Vicky C. ‘26 with the Class Shank, and then Marco A. ‘26 and Katrina L. ‘26 with the Seal Shank. I practically knew everyone’s lines by heart and I could still barely figure out what anyone was saying over the noise. shoutout b1 sophomores for supporting <3 get mogged living groups dressing up!!! kresge is starting to fill up! hype! so hype! even more hype! hype ft. cowboy hats! more cowboy hats! more hype! HYPE!!! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Jamie came back to present the winner of the Puzzle Sprint, ⁠ 02 which is super cool, and you can check it out at this link: http://brassrat.mit.edu/2026/puzzlesprint who won a free 14k gold ring! After that, at long last, it was time for me and Ann L. ‘26, two of the artists on RingComm, to present the Bezel! As our video faded out and we walked on stage, we were greeted by a wall of sound . The sheer enormity of Premiere kind of hit me all at once. We forgot to track attendance, but Kresge seats around 1200, ⁠ 03 so basically somewhere between twelve and twelve-hundred people attended, i think and from what I could see squinting against the bright lights, it looked pretty damn close to being full. People always say that Ring Premiere and Ring Delivery are some of the few events in your undergraduate career where you get to see so many people in your class all gathered in one place, and I knew this, but it was still absurd to witness. After months and months of hard work and sealed lips, we were finally getting to show the class of 2026… the Bezel! enraptured... it's bezel time! here we go... tada! huh? wait a second... An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next …just kidding. Ann and I actually had the honor of presenting the Joke Bezel , i.e. a silly, fake Bezel that usually precedes the actual Bezel, because we haven’t kept our class waiting long enough. After getting boo’d offstage (lovingly, I’m sure), we handed the batons to Helena U. ‘26 and Maggie Y. ‘26, RingComm Chair and Vice-Chair, to finally present the real Bezel! With that, the entire ring design had been unveiled! Overall, lots of elements of the design remain similar to what you traditionally see on a Brass Rat, but we added a few unique elements that I particularly like. On various sides of the ring, we show an archer beaver, a sailing beaver, a pistol beaver, and a fencing beaver, to represent the four P.E. classes needed to obtain a Pirate’s License at MIT. Additionally, we included a night sky motif across the ring as a nod to how, like the beaver, our best work as MIT students often happens at night. For example, the Cambridge Skyline, which is usually depicted in the daytime, was shown against the night sky in our rendition. Even the hacker’s map took the form of a starry constellation, to guide us through the tunnels just as people once used stars to navigate the seas. (Also, if you look closely, you can see a beaver hidden in the Hacker’s Map constellation – we managed to feature a beaver on every face of the ring!) If you’re curious about the rationale behind other design details, feel free to read more here ! the bezel! the seal shank! the class shank! the boston skyline! the cambridge skyline! the hacker's map! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next The hype hadn’t ended just yet though. Marco and Katrina, our co-Delivery chairs, returned to announce where the class of 2026’s Ring Delivery would be held! Ring Delivery is the big fancy event where everyone actually gets the rings that they ordered post-Premiere. This year, our Delivery is going to be on May 5th, at the top of the Prudential Center ! Finally, the night was coming to an end. Ring Premiere concluded with the committee members each launching an aforementioned beaver Squishmallow into the crowd! With that, it was a wrap! premiere is coming to an end... tim takes a bow! rip the people in the back... surprisingly hard to throw a squishy, soccer-ball-sized projectile An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next ★ a recounting of being on RingComm Just to be upfront, being a member of the class of 2026 Ring Committee is a lot of work. The first time the twelve of us all met as a group was actually volunteering for the class of 2025’s Ring Delivery. Our first opportunity to get to know each other was through forced proximity – the ‘25 Ring Committee had us running around sorting over a thousand rings alphabetically, breaking down cardboard boxes, squinting at IDs and spamming Ctrl + F on a check-in spreadsheet, desperately tracking down literally any person who knew how to refill the water dispensers, and whatever other mundanities our class of 2025 overlords demanded ⁠ 04 just kidding, the 25s are chill, and so was ring delivery <3 fear not, future class of 2027 ring committee members ^_^ of us. However, our work didn’t really begin until a few months later, during the summer. Our first task was to design a logo that would be used later down the line for all of our posters, brochures, website, etc. After many car-ride sketches, Zoom calls in a hotel kitchen in the Canadian Rockies, and only an hour (not bad!) of mulling over slightly different hex codes of gold, we finally had our logo! early sketches! the process... the final logo! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Our next biggest undertaking was actually designing the ring, which took six hours of meetings per week over a big chunk of fall semester. I think a lot of people, MIT students included, have kind of a misconception about how this process actually goes. Not everyone on the committee is an artist; rather, roles range from web chair to publicity chair to treasurer to being in charge of the various events we hold throughout the year, such as study break, Premiere, and Delivery. (Also, shout out to our Chair and Vice-Chair <3) Historically, a minority of the committee actually has the title of an artist. The class of 2026 RingComm, for example, has three – me, Ann, and Vicky. By no means are we the only ones who played a hand in the design of the ring, though! In fact, it truly is a group effort. All of the committee members spent a lot of time poring over past websites , logos, ring designs, etc. picking out elements we liked or didn’t like. This helped us decide our direction for the ring design and/or the general ~vibes~ ⁠ 05 we ended up going for a more playful, unserious vibe as opposed to a more professional one, shown through the doodles on our instagram posts and the silly pictures when you hover over the committee member headshots on the website :) we wanted to give off. On top of that, each member brainstormed various elements we thought would memorialize the class of 2026’s MIT undergraduate experience. As artists, our job was to help turn the ideas of the committee into reality. If someone wanted to play around with the idea of including a solar eclipse on the seal shank, or see what the soccer players on the bezel would look like shifted a millimeter to the left, we were on hand to quickly sketch or make adjustments so the committee could see how the design was shaping up in real time. On top of that, we worked closely with professional artists from Herff Jones, the company that manufactures our rings. They gave us immediate feedback on how well certain details would translate to the small surface of the ring, and ultimately they were the ones who drew the final designs and 3d models in order to manufacture the actual rings. Each side of the ring came with a lot of iterations. Each time we’d meet, we’d add new ideas or cut back on others; we’d make the tiniest microadjustments, like changing the beaver’s tuft of cheek fur on the Bezel or making sure the Lobby 10 doors are centered on the Class Shank; we’d do everything we could to make sure the design was as close to perfect as we could get it. Below are just a few out of the dozens of iterations ⁠ 06 the google doc we used to document bezel changes/ideas is literally 60 pages long... we made for the Bezel! some car-ride sketches i did playing around with beaver poses and stylization! ann's initial rough draft... so cute!!! you can already see lots of elements of the final bezel design take shape getting the pose down, blocking in the background elements ooh, fun river swirls...? woah too much, dial it back looking good!! time to clean it up! this is like playing spot the difference... An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Artists had other responsibilities, too! We were in charge of making designs for everything from posters to stickers to t-shirts! A lot of our work was concentrated around fall semester, but we were on call year-round to help make pubbing materials and merch for all the events. graphic i made for the ringcomm website! stickers!!! via me and vicky :) poster i made for study break poster i made for study break ann's awesome t-shirt design... we gave a free one out to everyone in the class! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next So yeah, RingComm is undoubtedly a lot of work. But I love it nonetheless! I think it’d come out kind of cheesy and try-hard if I attempt to explain how much RingComm means to me. It’s become a huge part of my life, not just because of the six hours of meetings every week. Everyone on RingComm is so awesomely clever and fun to work with. They’ve become my ride-or-dies; we’ve weathered many ups and downs as a committee, and I’m so excited to see all of our hard work be celebrated at Ring Delivery. Not to mention, to know that I got to play a part in designing something so iconic, so steeped in tradition and ceremony, is amazing to me. I’ve seen Brass Rats on superheroes and in local cafes, and soon, come May 5th, nearly 98% of my classmates will own the very Brass Rat I helped create. It’s unbelievably fulfilling and mind-blowing. As a preview, all twelve members of RingComm have a temporary, sample Brass Rat ⁠ 07 mine is a 10k white gold ring with a small bezel size! in various colors and sizes so our classmates can get an idea of what they’ll actually look like. At Ring Delivery, we’ll swap in our placeholder ring and receive our actual ring alongside everyone else! As it stands, I’m pretty used to wearing chunky rings, but the Brass Rat carries a different weight to it altogether. I guess the knowledge that donning one means I’m joining the ranks of decades-worth of Brass-Rat-wielding MIT students gives it a little extra heft. pre-premiere! post-premiere... some of us were eager to change lol shoutout ringcomm. love you guys <3 the artists!!! me, ann, and vicky :) ooooh rings...

'26 and what led up to it! March 28, 2024 in Events , MIT History & Culture , MIT Life ★ a recounting of Premiere (Oops, it’s been like 1.5 months since) Ring Premiere happened! For almost a year now, I’ve had the privilege of being on the Class of 2026 Ring Committee! Ring Committee, also known as RingComm, is a group of twelve students tasked with designing the Brass Rat for their class. If you don’t already know, the Brass Rat is a class ring that MIT undergraduates receive at the end of their second year. It has an extensive history (that I won’t go into but you can read about it here and here ) and has made appearances on the fingers of Tony Stark, the John Harvard statue, and soon, my classmates. In the several months leading up to Premiere, RingComm had been moving in silence. standing on business, even. working on the ring design in private. In order to ensure the secrecy of the design until Premiere, we even resorted to taping CVS pharmacy receipts and crumpled pset packets over the door window of the classroom where we’d meet twice a week. But on February 10th, it was finally time to unveil the design to the entire class! The day started off rather unassuming. For the first few hours, my tasks consisted of lugging boxes of t-shirts and toothpick holders, ⁠ 01 i wasn't talking about shot glasses at all. why would you even think that. blowing up balloons and fluffing up decorative pom-poms, and testing how far I could reasonably chuck various mini beaver Squishmallows into the auditorium seats. By 5pm, we’d finished running through our dress rehearsals and setting up decorations. All that was left for the committee was to get changed and get hyped. At 6:30pm, doors opened. I was holed up backstage as my classmates were filtering into Kresge Auditorium, but I could slowly hear the ambient sounds get louder and rowdier as more and more people filed in. At some point, I poked my head out to assess the crowd situation, and saw various greek life/living communities and friend groups dressed in funky hats and group costumes, as is custom for Premiere. Finally, at 7:05pm, lights dimmed to outrageous cheer. This year RingComm tried something a little new for Premiere – we filmed short little video skits to play before each duo walked on stage to present. By the time Hailey P. ‘26 and Sean H. ‘26, our Co-Premiere chairs, walked on stage to kick us off with the Hacker’s Map, the decibel levels in the room were insane. Shrieks and hollers broke out every half a sentence, and the crowd only got louder as the presentation progressed. Sabrina C. ‘26 and Jamie O. ‘26 were up next with the Cambridge and Boston skylines, followed by Nathan K. ‘26 and Vicky C. ‘26 with the Class Shank, and then Marco A. ‘26 and Katrina L. ‘26 with the Seal Shank. I practically knew everyone’s lines by heart and I could still barely figure out what anyone was saying over the noise. shoutout b1 sophomores for supporting <3 get mogged living groups dressing up!!! kresge is starting to fill up! hype! so hype! even more hype! hype ft. cowboy hats! more cowboy hats! more hype! HYPE!!! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Jamie came back to present the winner of the Puzzle Sprint, ⁠ 02 which is super cool, and you can check it out at this link: http://brassrat.mit.edu/2026/puzzlesprint who won a free 14k gold ring! After that, at long last, it was time for me and Ann L. ‘26, two of the artists on RingComm, to present the Bezel! As our video faded out and we walked on stage, we were greeted by a wall of sound . The sheer enormity of Premiere kind of hit me all at once. We forgot to track attendance, but Kresge seats around 1200, ⁠ 03 so basically somewhere between twelve and twelve-hundred people attended, i think and from what I could see squinting against the bright lights, it looked pretty damn close to being full. People always say that Ring Premiere and Ring Delivery are some of the few events in your undergraduate career where you get to see so many people in your class all gathered in one place, and I knew this, but it was still absurd to witness. After months and months of hard work and sealed lips, we were finally getting to show the class of 2026… the Bezel! enraptured... it's bezel time! here we go... tada! huh? wait a second... An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next …just kidding. Ann and I actually had the honor of presenting the Joke Bezel , i.e. a silly, fake Bezel that usually precedes the actual Bezel, because we haven’t kept our class waiting long enough. After getting boo’d offstage (lovingly, I’m sure), we handed the batons to Helena U. ‘26 and Maggie Y. ‘26, RingComm Chair and Vice-Chair, to finally present the real Bezel! With that, the entire ring design had been unveiled! Overall, lots of elements of the design remain similar to what you traditionally see on a Brass Rat, but we added a few unique elements that I particularly like. On various sides of the ring, we show an archer beaver, a sailing beaver, a pistol beaver, and a fencing beaver, to represent the four P.E. classes needed to obtain a Pirate’s License at MIT. Additionally, we included a night sky motif across the ring as a nod to how, like the beaver, our best work as MIT students often happens at night. For example, the Cambridge Skyline, which is usually depicted in the daytime, was shown against the night sky in our rendition. Even the hacker’s map took the form of a starry constellation, to guide us through the tunnels just as people once used stars to navigate the seas. (Also, if you look closely, you can see a beaver hidden in the Hacker’s Map constellation – we managed to feature a beaver on every face of the ring!) If you’re curious about the rationale behind other design details, feel free to read more here ! the bezel! the seal shank! the class shank! the boston skyline! the cambridge skyline! the hacker's map! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next The hype hadn’t ended just yet though. Marco and Katrina, our co-Delivery chairs, returned to announce where the class of 2026’s Ring Delivery would be held! Ring Delivery is the big fancy event where everyone actually gets the rings that they ordered post-Premiere. This year, our Delivery is going to be on May 5th, at the top of the Prudential Center ! Finally, the night was coming to an end. Ring Premiere concluded with the committee members each launching an aforementioned beaver Squishmallow into the crowd! With that, it was a wrap! premiere is coming to an end... tim takes a bow! rip the people in the back... surprisingly hard to throw a squishy, soccer-ball-sized projectile An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next ★ a recounting of being on RingComm Just to be upfront, being a member of the class of 2026 Ring Committee is a lot of work. The first time the twelve of us all met as a group was actually volunteering for the class of 2025’s Ring Delivery. Our first opportunity to get to know each other was through forced proximity – the ‘25 Ring Committee had us running around sorting over a thousand rings alphabetically, breaking down cardboard boxes, squinting at IDs and spamming Ctrl + F on a check-in spreadsheet, desperately tracking down literally any person who knew how to refill the water dispensers, and whatever other mundanities our class of 2025 overlords demanded ⁠ 04 just kidding, the 25s are chill, and so was ring delivery <3 fear not, future class of 2027 ring committee members ^_^ of us. However, our work didn’t really begin until a few months later, during the summer. Our first task was to design a logo that would be used later down the line for all of our posters, brochures, website, etc. After many car-ride sketches, Zoom calls in a hotel kitchen in the Canadian Rockies, and only an hour (not bad!) of mulling over slightly different hex codes of gold, we finally had our logo! early sketches! the process... the final logo! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Our next biggest undertaking was actually designing the ring, which took six hours of meetings per week over a big chunk of fall semester. I think a lot of people, MIT students included, have kind of a misconception about how this process actually goes. Not everyone on the committee is an artist; rather, roles range from web chair to publicity chair to treasurer to being in charge of the various events we hold throughout the year, such as study break, Premiere, and Delivery. (Also, shout out to our Chair and Vice-Chair <3) Historically, a minority of the committee actually has the title of an artist. The class of 2026 RingComm, for example, has three – me, Ann, and Vicky. By no means are we the only ones who played a hand in the design of the ring, though! In fact, it truly is a group effort. All of the committee members spent a lot of time poring over past websites , logos, ring designs, etc. picking out elements we liked or didn’t like. This helped us decide our direction for the ring design and/or the general ~vibes~ ⁠ 05 we ended up going for a more playful, unserious vibe as opposed to a more professional one, shown through the doodles on our instagram posts and the silly pictures when you hover over the committee member headshots on the website :) we wanted to give off. On top of that, each member brainstormed various elements we thought would memorialize the class of 2026’s MIT undergraduate experience. As artists, our job was to help turn the ideas of the committee into reality. If someone wanted to play around with the idea of including a solar eclipse on the seal shank, or see what the soccer players on the bezel would look like shifted a millimeter to the left, we were on hand to quickly sketch or make adjustments so the committee could see how the design was shaping up in real time. On top of that, we worked closely with professional artists from Herff Jones, the company that manufactures our rings. They gave us immediate feedback on how well certain details would translate to the small surface of the ring, and ultimately they were the ones who drew the final designs and 3d models in order to manufacture the actual rings. Each side of the ring came with a lot of iterations. Each time we’d meet, we’d add new ideas or cut back on others; we’d make the tiniest microadjustments, like changing the beaver’s tuft of cheek fur on the Bezel or making sure the Lobby 10 doors are centered on the Class Shank; we’d do everything we could to make sure the design was as close to perfect as we could get it. Below are just a few out of the dozens of iterations ⁠ 06 the google doc we used to document bezel changes/ideas is literally 60 pages long... we made for the Bezel! some car-ride sketches i did playing around with beaver poses and stylization! ann's initial rough draft... so cute!!! you can already see lots of elements of the final bezel design take shape getting the pose down, blocking in the background elements ooh, fun river swirls...? woah too much, dial it back looking good!! time to clean it up! this is like playing spot the difference... An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next Artists had other responsibilities, too! We were in charge of making designs for everything from posters to stickers to t-shirts! A lot of our work was concentrated around fall semester, but we were on call year-round to help make pubbing materials and merch for all the events. graphic i made for the ringcomm website! stickers!!! via me and vicky :) poster i made for study break poster i made for study break ann's awesome t-shirt design... we gave a free one out to everyone in the class! An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next So yeah, RingComm is undoubtedly a lot of work. But I love it nonetheless! I think it’d come out kind of cheesy and try-hard if I attempt to explain how much RingComm means to me. It’s become a huge part of my life, not just because of the six hours of meetings every week. Everyone on RingComm is so awesomely clever and fun to work with. They’ve become my ride-or-dies; we’ve weathered many ups and downs as a committee, and I’m so excited to see all of our hard work be celebrated at Ring Delivery. Not to mention, to know that I got to play a part in designing something so iconic, so steeped in tradition and ceremony, is amazing to me. I’ve seen Brass Rats on superheroes and in local cafes, and soon, come May 5th, nearly 98% of my classmates will own the very Brass Rat I helped create. It’s unbelievably fulfilling and mind-blowing. As a preview, all twelve members of RingComm have a temporary, sample Brass Rat ⁠ 07 mine is a 10k white gold ring with a small bezel size! in various colors and sizes so our classmates can get an idea of what they’ll actually look like. At Ring Delivery, we’ll swap in our placeholder ring and receive our actual ring alongside everyone else! As it stands, I’m pretty used to wearing chunky rings, but the Brass Rat carries a different weight to it altogether. I guess the knowledge that donning one means I’m joining the ranks of decades-worth of Brass-Rat-wielding MIT students gives it a little extra heft. pre-premiere! post-premiere... some of us were eager to change lol shoutout ringcomm. love you guys <3 the artists!!! me, ann, and vicky :) ooooh rings...

We also coordinate the Educational Council, an international network of over 3,500 alumni who serve as local ambassadors and conduct interviews , and host more than 45,000 visitors a year who attend our information sessions and campus tours . MIT Admissions was established in 1929, and is currently led by Stu Schmill ’86 , Dean of Admissions and Student Financial Services. Our team of admissions officers , support staff, admissions bloggers , tour guides, and student workers take pride in the mission, vision, tradition , and integrity of our work on behalf of the Institute and those who aspire to attend it. As one of our colleagues once wrote, we believe that working at MIT Admissions is more than a job : i t is a privilege, an honor, and a responsibility, and requires a public and institutional trust that we do not take for granted and work very hard to keep. Our Mission The MIT Office of Undergraduate Admissions enrolls a talented and diverse undergraduate student body composed of some of the world’s most intelligent and creative individuals interested in an education centered on science and technology. The students we enroll add to a vibrant campus community and will become the leaders and innovators of our global society. We uphold a commitment to meritocracy and fair access to our admissions process for students from all backgrounds. Our Principles In pursuing our mission, and realizing our vision, we are guided by several principles that help us do the right thing by our applicants and our institution. We are egalitarian For us, egalitarian means that we evaluate all students on equal terms, and on the basis of their own individual interests and aptitudes as opposed to their resources or connections. All admitted students pass through the same demanding process ⁠ 02 Before any applicant is accepted, that person’s application passes through at least five distinct stages of review and is evaluated by several different committees composed of admissions officers and faculty reviewers. This <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/selection/\">process</a>, which is unique in its particular design and has held fast for more than 50 years, guards against an individual’s biases, preferences, or familiarity with a given applicant swaying a decision unfairly. and meet the same demanding standard, regardless of legacy status , donor affiliation, or athletic recruitment. We have no quotas by school, state, region, or socioeconomic background, but we also value diversity and believe that it contributes to the merit of each class. We are fortunate to be able to consider all applicants without regard for their ability to pay for the MIT education, and meet their full financial need with our generous aid . We acknowledge that there are many ways to define the “the best” students , and that it’s very difficult to disentangle privilege from opportunity and act not only equally but equitably on every applicant.  However, we do the best we possibly can to consider each student’s achievements and potential relative to their context , and to allocate scarce seats in the class where they will have the highest impact: for the student, for the Institute, and for the world. We are accessible For us, accessible means that anyone should be able to understand how to apply to MIT, be able to complete an application, ⁠ 03 For example, we routinely <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/for-those-impacted-by-hurricane-michael-and-other-disasters/\">extend deadlines on account of disasters</a>, and routinely <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/application-fee-fee-waiver/\">waive fees</a> if they might present any hardship. and, if admitted, be able to afford to attend. ⁠ 04 Our <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/afford/cost-aid-basics/\">full-need financial aid</a> meets 100% of all students’ demonstrated financial need. We are committed to making MIT financially accessible. To do this, describe our admissions process, in print and online, in as comprehensive and comprehensible a manner as we can. ⁠ 05 Including annotations where necessary. We are as transparent about our work as possible: we tell you what we are looking for , publish admissions statistics , and avoid any unnecessary complexities or hidden preferences ⁠ 06 For example, we don't care if you apply Early or Regular, we don't consider demonstrated interest, we're need-blind, and so on. that could give some applicants an unfair advantage through access to ‘insider’ knowledge. We also believe in truth-in-advertising and try to present MIT accurately : good, bad, and otherwise. When we travel, we try to recruit from the broadest possible public, and our Educational Council offers interviews to as many students as it can to help demystify MIT. We are easy to contact, and try to respond to all 70,000+ emails we receive per year as quickly and personally as we can. We acknowledge that that there is an ironic tension between our goal of being accessible and the reality that the vast majority of our applicants will not be offered admission. However, we believe that our work to demystify both MIT and the admissions process, as well as our commitment to a level playing field, contributes to the well-being of our applicants, their families, and the broader ‘system’ in which we collectively have a stake. We are responsible For us, being responsible means acknowledging that we have a moral obligation to act ethically, on behalf of our institution and the public we serve . To that end, we routinely reconsider, and reflect upon, our programs and processes to ask ourselves if they are student-centered, institutionally aligned, and in the public interest . We understand that our actions and expectations influence the behavior of students, parents, and others with a stake in our work, and try to support initiatives and affirm principles that we hope will positively influence the conversation around college admissions. We encourage students to be their best selves rather than conform to what they imagine might get them into MIT, and we try to remind them that their application is not the end, but the beginning, of a set of choices that will cumulatively determine their life.

We are located on our own domain (i.e., not on mit.edu) for historical reasons: when we started our blogs back in 2004, we had to use external hosting and an external domain name in order to do so. Since then, we’ve built up a following and sense of home at this domain, so we’ve just stayed here. This website is a resource about first-year and transfer admissions. We do not conduct admissions for graduate education or professional and continuing education . We update our website regularly and strive to keep it as accurate (and accessible) as possible. As a general rule, you may consider as authoritative any static page ⁠ 01 Basically, any page on this website that isn't a blog post and lives somewhere in the navbar structure. , or help page. Blog posts, particularly those regarding the admissions process or financial aid, may be out of date . About the blogs The MIT admissions blogs are an institution we started in 2004 to help our students (and staff) speak directly to our applicants and the broader public. As Ben Jones put it : Social media as we know it today didn’t exist when we launched our great experiment of promoting unfiltered/uncensored narratives and connecting prospective and current students directly. Facebook was only a few months old and restricted to a handful of colleges, which ruled out pretty much all of our prospective students. Twitter was still a couple of years away, as was Tumblr. The lack of third-party resources, in large part, enabled the blogs to become the epicenter of the online community we hoped to build around MIT Admissions. We think our blogs are a little different from other sites because we don’t give our bloggers talking points: they simply get an account and can immediately begin posting directly to our homepage. The only standards we give them are: be reasonably readable: we aren’t SNOOTs but avoid anything that would give a copywriter an aneurysm be factually accurate: freely blog about the good, bad, and ugly parts of your life (and MIT), but just make sure it’s true write for a general audience of applicants: don’t use too much impenetrable jargon, or try to advance your own ~*~influencer~*~ career, at the expense of the audience don’t get the blogs shut down: catchall for doing anything really unconscionably stupid However, we also tell our bloggers that, if they meet all these reasonable standards, we will defend them to the hilt on their right to blog whatever they want. Students and staff are speaking for themselves in their blog posts, and not on behalf of the Institute, unless stated specifically otherwise. A final note on accuracy: because we’ve been blogging for years and years, and because we’ve kept the entire corpus up, there are some old blog posts that may not be accurate in specific operational details (e.g. when that year’s decisions will be released) or facts about the institution (e.g. how many clubs there are at any particular time). However, the blogs typically have a long shelf life at the cultural and philosophical level, because those things have stayed consistent at MIT for decades, which we are very proud about. About the comments Since 2004 we have offered an open comment section to our readers, because we want them to be part of our community and its conversations. We have also always offered the ability to comment anonymously, because we understand that some readers might worry about whether their comments would impact their applications. We try to avoid removing comments, or banning commenters, whenever possible, including those that may disagree with our bloggers, office, or institution. Such comment sections were once a mainstay of blogs on the open web, but have been largely choked off by trolls, as well as the migration of conversations to walled gardens like Facebook. We want to keep ours alive, nurtured, and cultivated, with an absolute minimum of “weeding” required to let everything else bloom . As Ta-Nehisi Coates, who long ran a great comments section , once said at a talk at MIT on the subject: Coates wants his blog to be a place where people feel safe– not that they won’t face hard arguments– but that people wouldn’t feel a pariah status while reading. He compares a blog post to a dinner party. A good host simply won’t allow some things to be said, and a blog conversation is much the same. “Once you take out the rubbish and clear away the weeds, flowers begin to grow.” There’s a lot of rubbish out there, Coates tells us. People who don’t normally comment will come forward if you cultivate a good garden. To cultivate this garden, all we ask is that you don’t be a jerk . We reserve the right to remove comments and ban people who are libelous, bigoted, or acting in bad faith. But we welcome everything—and everyone—else. About the illustrations All the little illustrations you see around the site were drawn by Lydia K. ’14, MEng ’16, a former blogger and always artist. If you visit MIT, you might see these characters painted around campus, especially if you visit Random Hall . You can follow her work @ nightlyfieldlog .

If you are a citizen of a foreign country, you may apply for fall entry (September) only. For fall entry (September), we must receive your final application with all supporting documents by March 15, 2024 .

We recommend that one evaluation be from a math or science instructor. We find that the best recommendations are written by professors who know an applicant well as both a student and a person. You are also welcome (but not required) to submit two supplemental letters of recommendation from high school teachers, employers, etc. School Official Report We also require a School Official Report from your advisor, registrar, or another school official. Applicants are encouraged to use the electronic form built into the MIT transfer application to request the School Official Report. If a hard copy of the form is required by your current (or most recent) institution, you can download a PDF version of the School Official Report . The school official should submit the completed report to [email protected] , by fax to 617.687.9174, or by mail to MIT Admissions . Transcripts Transfer applicants are required to upload a copy of their transcripts within the MIT transfer application from each institution they have attended—including all secondary/high schools, colleges, and universities. Official transcripts are only required for transfer students who are admitted and choose to enroll at MIT. Standardized tests We require the SAT or the ACT for both first year and transfer applicants. We do not require the ACT writing section or the SAT optional essay. We accept both the paper and digital SAT. In order to apply for transfer admission, you must take the required tests before October 31 for spring entry, and before March 31 for fall entry. Superscoring If a student takes the same test multiple times, we will consider the highest score achieved in each section. We do this in order to consider all applicants in their best light. Please note that our office will verify scores for all enrolling students. Any discrepancies between official and self-reported scores may affect a student’s offer of admission.

If you are a citizen of a foreign country, you may apply for fall entry (September) only. For fall entry (September), we must receive your final application with all supporting documents by March 15, 2024 . Spring ENTRY October 15, 2023: Spring semester application deadline Mid-November: Applicants for spring semester are notified of admissions decisions Mid-December: Deadline for enrollment for admitted spring semester transfer students Fall ENTRY March 15, 2024: Fall semester application deadline Early May: Applicants for fall semester are notified of admissions decisions Early June: Deadline for enrollment for admitted fall semester transfer students Evaluations We require two academic evaluations from college professors or instructors. We recommend that one evaluation be from a math or science instructor. We find that the best recommendations are written by professors who know an applicant well as both a student and a person. You are also welcome (but not required) to submit two supplemental letters of recommendation from high school teachers, employers, etc. School Official Report We also require a School Official Report from your advisor, registrar, or another school official. Applicants are encouraged to use the electronic form built into the MIT transfer application to request the School Official Report. If a hard copy of the form is required by your current (or most recent) institution, you can download a PDF version of the School Official Report . The school official should submit the completed report to [email protected] , by fax to 617.687.9174, or by mail to MIT Admissions . Transcripts Transfer applicants are required to upload a copy of their transcripts within the MIT transfer application from each institution they have attended—including all secondary/high schools, colleges, and universities. Official transcripts are only required for transfer students who are admitted and choose to enroll at MIT. Standardized tests We require the SAT or the ACT for both first year and transfer applicants. We do not require the ACT writing section or the SAT optional essay. We accept both the paper and digital SAT. In order to apply for transfer admission, you must take the required tests before October 31 for spring entry, and before March 31 for fall entry. Superscoring If a student takes the same test multiple times, we will consider the highest score achieved in each section. We do this in order to consider all applicants in their best light. Please note that our office will verify scores for all enrolling students. Any discrepancies between official and self-reported scores may affect a student’s offer of admission.

If you are still in high school, you are considered a first-year applicant regardless of how many classes you may have taken at the university or college level. The transfer application is closed in the MIT application portal . One application per entry year Transfer students may only submit one application per entry year , meaning if you apply to enter in the spring term, you cannot reapply for the fall term of the same calendar year. (For example, if you apply for the spring 2024 term, you cannot also apply for the fall 2024 term, because both terms occur in the same entry year.) If you are a citizen of a foreign country, you may apply for fall (September) entry only. Term eligibility Minimum of two terms of full-time study Students who will have completed at least two terms of study with high academic standing at an accredited college, university, technical institute, or community college may apply for transfer admission. If you are in your first year of college, the earliest you can apply to transfer to MIT is during your second term of study. Maximum of five terms of full-time study Students who at the time of entry to MIT will have completed more than two and a half years (i.e., five terms) of college may not be eligible because of our residency requirements. If you have been enrolled in college part-time, you should calculate your full-time term equivalency in order to estimate your eligibility. Keep in mind that eligibility will be assessed by the Admissions Committee in the application review process. MIT does not award second bachelor’s degrees MIT does not award second bachelor’s degrees—even if you are interested in pursuing a different field of study from the bachelor’s degree you hold. If you are ineligible for either first-year or transfer admissions, yo u may consider MIT’s opportunities for graduate education , open learning , or professional education .

To prepare for MIT’s academic program , we recommend that transfer students complete the following college courses before entering MIT: Single variable calculus Multivariable calculus Calculus-based physics Introductory biology Introductory chemistry If you received college credit through advanced exams (AP, IB, etc.), then you should enroll at the appropriate level for each of the disciplines mentioned above. Core graduation requirements General Institute Requirements for undergraduate students of all majors at MIT include a science core that consists of two semesters of college calculus and calculus-based physics, and one semester each of chemistry and biology. For more details about the GIRs, please refer to the MIT Bulletin . GPA There is no minimum required GPA, but competitive applicants generally have a GPA of 3.5 or above, and mostly A’s in mathematics and science courses. Testing must be completed by the October test date for spring (February) entry and by the March test date for fall (September) entry. These dates change each year and are set by the testing agency. Click here for specifics on our testing requirements. Activities Choose your activities because they really delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, research, activities, internships, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers who bring out your best, and that please you so much you don’t mind the work involved. Credit transfer If we admit you as a transfer student, you can expect to receive credit for subjects of study that are substantively equivalent to corresponding MIT subjects. If your academic record doesn’t appear to merit credit in a certain subject, you may be allowed to demonstrate that you are entitled to such credit by passing an Advanced Standing Examination . Academic credit is not assessed until after you are admitted to MIT, at which point it is evaluated by the relevant academic departments. If you would like to compare the courses offered at your institution to those offered at MIT, you can refer to the MIT Bulletin (Course and Degree Catalog). Transfer students typically lose at least one semester of coursework. Most students enter MIT as sophomores, regardless of the amount of coursework they completed at their previous college(s).

This includes the secondary school materials required of all transfer applicants . Letters of support We often recommend that non-traditional applicants take some courses at a community college or in a non-degree program to brush up on their classroom experience and get some recent teacher evaluations. While we do require evaluations from educators, supplemental recommendations from your employers or mentors can provide useful information, especially if teacher evaluations are difficult to obtain.

If you are a veteran interested in an MIT education, please know that we deeply appreciate your interest and your service, and we look forward to supporting you through the admissions process. How to apply Veterans may apply for admission through the same process as other prospective students. While most veterans are eligible to apply for transfer admission , some are eligible for first-year admission , so please review our eligibility information to determine which application you should use. If you have already completed an undergraduate degree elsewhere, you may explore MIT’s options for continuing/professional education or graduate education . Academic preparation A strong academic foundation with preparation in advanced math and science both improves your odds of getting into MIT, and helps you make the most of the Institute when you’re here. Strong applicants for both first-year and transfer admission will have demonstrated recent success in advanced math and science, including: Math through calculus Calculus-based physics Chemistry Biology MIT’s General Institute Requirements demand that all undergraduate students must take (or place out of, through an Advanced Standing Examination ) the following while at MIT: Two semesters of calculus Two semesters of calculus-based physics One semester of chemistry One semester of biology Applicants who have not completed this academic preparation should consider first enrolling at a different institution (like a community college or another four-year college) to brush up on their academics before applying to MIT. Students may also explore MIT’s online and open learning courses offered through MITx and MIT OpenCourseWare . Affordability and financial benefits MIT’s offers full-need financial aid through need-blind admissions for all undergraduate students. If you are accepted for undergraduate study, we will make sure that you can afford to come to MIT . As a veteran of the U.S. armed forces, you may be eligible for benefits that can significantly aid in your costs to attend MIT. Information specific to veterans (including Post-9/11 GI Bill®, Yellow Ribbon Program, and other financial support benefits) is available on the Student Financial Services site. Note: as a Veteran of the U.S. armed forces, you are considered independent of parental financial support. When you apply for aid, your financial need will be calculated according to your individual income and assets without regard to your parents’ financial circumstances. Application guidance Our applications ask straightforward questions about who you are, where you come from, what you’ve done so far, and what you hope to do. We also ask for information about your academic coursework, test scores, and letters of recommendation from people who know you well. We look at each application as a whole—taking into account the many different factors that have shaped each applicant’s experience—and spend the next few months reading what you’ve written and assembling the best class to go through MIT together. Keep in mind that your story is uniquely yours, and that everyone is on their own journey. As cliché as it sounds, simply being yourself is the best approach to our application. Military history We encourage you to share as much about your military experience on the MIT application as you feel comfortable sharing. We provide space in the application to reflect on your military experience and provide any additional information as it pertains to your service. Activities, jobs, and distinctions We ask about an applicant’s work experience, extracurricular activities, summer activities, and any awards and distinctions they have earned, not only to understand how applicants spend their time, but also to gather context about the opportunities and resources available to them. Some sections of the application may seem geared toward traditional applicants—but veteran applicants should feel free to complete these sections to the best of their ability. Veterans may choose to complete these sections with only military-related content, or they may have other experiences and commitments they wish to include (like internship, research, or other work experiences, community involvement and volunteering, or home and family responsibilities). Essays The short essays on the MIT application are not a writing test—they are an opportunity to share your voice. We want to learn more about who you are, what motivates you, and what’s important to you. The essays provide you an opportunity to reflect on your past experiences and share information about your future goals. While your responses should be written clearly and answer the questions posed, the most important thing is to be your authentic self. We are using the content of your essays to get to know you as a potential member of the MIT community, so use the short essays as an opportunity to reflect on who you are. If you have specific questions about the application process for veterans, please contact the MIT Admissions veteran liaison . Veterans resources Service to School MIT has a proud partnership with Service to School (S2S) , a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that provides free college application assistance to transitioning service members and veterans. S2S was founded by veterans and is led by veterans who are committed to transforming the veteran community through the power of higher education. Student Veteran Success MIT also has an office of Student Veteran Success (SVS), run by program administrator Liam Gale, who served in the Air Force as an enlisted aviator and emergency management specialist for nearly eight years. SVS serves as a direct point of contact for students, providing support, advocacy, and programming designed to improve the experience of veterans, students currently serving in the military, and military families who are studying at MIT. To reach SVS, please email [email protected] .

'18 thoughts on being a (pure) math major March 11, 2017 in Academics & Research , Challenges , Classes , Majors & Minors , MIT Life View all As some of you may know, I am majoring in math and economics. Michelle has already written a lovely post about Course 14 (economics); I want to also talk a little about my experience being Course 18 and how it has differed from my experience doing math in high school. Basics: There are four types of math major at MIT— pure math , general math , applied math , and math with computer science . I do pure math , which will be the subject of this blog post. It’s important to note that there are significant differences among the different tracks—applied math has a whole different set of requirements, of which I have taken very few, and general math has super flexible requirements. Math with computer science, or 18C, requires several computer science classes and math classes that double as computer science classes; I have also taken very few of those. My perspective is that of someone who has been firmly on the pure math track for a few years and who hasn’t taken many of the more applied or CS-related classes. So let me now talk about my pure math classes. The requirements are: one differential equations class, a real analysis class, two algebra classes, one topology class, one additional analysis class (manifolds, functional analysis, or Fourier analysis), one or two seminars (depending on whether you took the “communication-intensive” version of real analysis or another “communication-intensive” class), and at least two additional math classes of your choosing. Here’s a page describing the communciation-intensive math classes–basically, they’re math classes with a heavy writing/presentation component, so that math majors learn how to talk and write (in LaTeX ) about their work. I recently realized that I am almost done with my major requirements (as in, I just dropped the one remaining class that would fill them out. It has been very abstract and mentally demanding but also satisfying). My college math classes require a lot more mental legwork than my high school ones did, in the sense that I’ve had to do much more struggling and wrestling with many new abstract concepts in my head for long periods of time, and it has been difficult! But worth it!! Differences from high school: I think I came into college with the expectation that my classes would be noticeably harder and more time-consuming than they were in high school, and for the most part that turned out to be true, though they ramped up in difficulty gradually rather than all at once. However, I also used to have the sense that I could learn anything I wanted as fast as I wanted, and I have definitely changed my mind on this front and come to terms with my limits in the past 2.5 years of school. One thing I want to note is that if you don’t think high-school math is particularly exciting or do math competitions, but you like to think about abstract concepts, please do keep an open mind about college math classes! My math classes in high school demanded a lot of memorization, and the problem-solving often turned out to be pretty algorithmic. Apply the concept you learned in class to a problem like the one from class, but with different numbers. After a certain amount of “training,” a sizeable chunk of competition math was like this for me, too. Specifically, I got better at math competitions by taking a lot of old practice tests, so that many of the problems I encountered were variations on old problems I had seen before. I guess I performed moderately well at math competitions, and they were part of what made me want to come to MIT, but I don’t think they were particularly good at showing me what being a math major would be like. Some things haven’t changed—as in high school, it helps to do practice problems, so you’re familiar with all the possible concepts and theorems you might be able to apply on an exam. It’s just that now there isn’t often enough time to practice enough, depending on what the rest of your schedule looks like. Also, there’s less emphasis on memorizing material for exams, and homework is often weighted equally with exams. As a whole, homework is served in larger chunks than it is in high school, so it’s important to learn to manage your time. There are also fewer examples in class and fewer problems that are near identical to those in the textbook. Finally, a big change is that everything is proof-based (as I write this, I struggle to remember what it meant for math to not be proof-based). You’re basically given an ever-expanding toolbox of definitions and lemmas and theorems and have to tinker until you can assemble them into solutions to the problems you’re asked to solve—it is a creative activity with strict rules and very little grounding in reality and applications. A great benefit of college math classes (besides GIRs) is that they’re full of people who actively like to think about math, and hopefully, if you’re a math major, you think math is pretty cool, too. It’s nice doing math with no expectation that it will be applicable in any way. I recently had to teach a section of a textbook for my math seminar, and it was all about applying the theory in the previous sections of the book to a physics problem (the displacement of a cantilever beam at rest with only the force of gravity acting on it, if you’re interested!!!). Even though I was tasked with presenting this part of the book, it was definitely not the section of the book I would consider the most interesting. I personally thought the fact that the material was applicable to a physics problem was much less exciting than the proofs in the previous sections. I am pretty sure no one is taking that seminar to learn about the ways in which math is applicable to physics. The main trend I have noticed is that math in college is much more intellectually stimulating and abstract than what I encountered in high school. By the way, if you’re at all peeved by the way math is taught in your high school, or curious about what math is like when it’s separated from its applications, I urge you to read Lockhart’s Lament , which was required reading for the communication-intensive real analysis class (18.100C, now renamed 18.100Q) I took my freshman spring. It criticizes math education in grade school and argues that math is an artistic and creative pursuit that is not taught as such—but should be. He laments the fact that students find math boring and suggests that the mainstream pedagogy is at fault. Struggles: It really helps to develop a strong intuitive understanding of the material you’re learning, although sometimes it gets difficult because there are no good analogies to real life. Sometimes you get stuck rereading a definition over and over and over, trying to flip back to earlier definitions that the current definition refers to in an effort to regain understanding of all the concepts that the concept at hand relies on, but to no avail, because there’s some other relevant concept from a math class you took two years ago that you need to revisit, so you look it up on Wikipedia, but by the time you understand it again, you forget what you were originally looking at, so you’re left scrambling to retrace the string of things you referred to, and at this point you still haven’t even started to solve the actual problem… Sometimes. But most of the time it’s not that bad. Sometimes it’s just tedious, and sometimes you have to write out long expressions with a lot of symbols in order to rigorously explain something that’s much easier to explain intuitively. Lockhart’s Lament is nice, but at some point you also have to buckle down and slosh around in tedium and make sure that all your symbols are written correctly. Getting used to math in college and dealing with impostor’s syndrome: I took 18.022 my freshman fall and found that it helped ease me into the sort of proofs and thinking that the rest of my math classes required. Perhaps if I had jumped immediately into 18.100 I would have been overwhelmed; I know for sure that I wouldn’t have been able to handle 18.701. There are people who can, and seeing other freshmen sail through more advanced classes definitely freaked me out at times and stoked my first touches of impostor’s syndrome. Now, though, I don’t think I can adequately stress the importance of not going too fast. Because math classes often rely on definitions and material from prerequisites, these prerequisites are often super useful, unless you’ve actually learned the exact material from the class you want to skip. Of course, there are exceptions, but I often find it a lot more difficult to grasp mathematical concepts that I’ve forgotten or skipped than to pick up other new material, like a programming language. I took 18.701 sophomore fall, and I attempted to take 18.702 last spring, but I ended up dropping it because I was overwhelmed by all the other stuff I was trying to do/learn. I was taking 18.125 concurrently. This semester, I once again made the poor choice of taking three math classes simultaneously, but I ended up dropping one of them last week because I simply could not handle it. I did not have enough time or energy to wrap my head around all the material, and I’m finally ( finally ) coming to recognize the importance of learning things well and deeply rather than learning them as fast as possible. Bear in mind that this sequence just happens to be what I ended up with, and it is not a recommendation that everybody should take those classes in this order. I am hesitant to give general advice about what classes to take and when because it depends so much on your personal background and how much time you have to devote to the class! A relevant article about impostor’s syndrome and the feeling of “racing” to learn math is “ The Wrong Way to Treat Child Geniuses ” by Jordan Ellenberg, a former “child prodigy” who is now a math professor at UW-Madison. This one might be particularly relevant to people who didn’t grow up being praised for being “good at math” or winning awards at math competitions. (This one’s also particularly hard to access without a WSJ subscription, sigh…) I’ve reproduced a relevant paragraph below: One of the most painful aspects of teaching mathematics is seeing my students damaged by the cult of the genius. That cult tells students that it’s not worth doing math unless you’re the best at math–because those special few are the only ones whose contributions really count. We don’t treat any other subject that way. I’ve never heard a student say, “I like ‘Hamlet,’ but I don’t really belong in AP English–that child who sits in the front row knows half the plays by heart, and he started reading Shakespeare when he was 7!” Basketball players don’t quit just because one of their teammates outshines them. But I see promising young mathematicians quit every year because someone in their range of vision is “ahead” of them. I think that MIT students, especially freshmen, are prone to psyching themselves out comparing themselves to all the people around them who have won the IMO or who were doing calculus in middle school—but Ellenberg points out that this type of thinking sounds absurd when applied to other fields and skills–and there is no reason that it should apply to math more than any other field. One of the first math majors I met at MIT had never done math competitions in high school and hadn’t had much exposure to higher-level math (i.e. calculus and beyond) coming into MIT, but he loved the math classes he was taking in college, so he began to register for more and more of them until he was thinking seriously about pursuing it as a profession. He was initially intimidated by his peers but enjoyed math so much that it was not a chore at all for him to devote significant amounts of time to mastering his coursework. He later became involved in research and is now pursuing his PhD in math at MIT! In summary, if you think math is cool, please consider continuing to study it in college, but bear in mind that college classes aren’t exactly like high school classes. And if you don’t think math is cool, maybe it hast to do with the way math is taught in your school. Or maybe not–not everyone is destined to be a math major! And if you’re intimidated and convinced that you’ll never be “good enough at math”, because other people seem to be so far “ahead,” well that’s almost certainly not the case–it’s much more important that you enjoy the subject and don’t try to jump ahead so quickly that you lose enjoyment of the subject in an attempt to “catch up.” If anyone has specific questions about classes or anything like that, I would also be happy to try to help you individually. I know I have been pretty absent from the blogs–life update coming soon–but I’m getting back in the swing of things. Sending you all strength and luck for pi day and all subsequent college and major choosing!

'18 thoughts on being a (pure) math major March 11, 2017 in Academics & Research , Challenges , Classes , Majors & Minors , MIT Life View all As some of you may know, I am majoring in math and economics. Michelle has already written a lovely post about Course 14 (economics); I want to also talk a little about my experience being Course 18 and how it has differed from my experience doing math in high school. Basics: There are four types of math major at MIT— pure math , general math , applied math , and math with computer science . I do pure math , which will be the subject of this blog post. It’s important to note that there are significant differences among the different tracks—applied math has a whole different set of requirements, of which I have taken very few, and general math has super flexible requirements. Math with computer science, or 18C, requires several computer science classes and math classes that double as computer science classes; I have also taken very few of those. My perspective is that of someone who has been firmly on the pure math track for a few years and who hasn’t taken many of the more applied or CS-related classes. So let me now talk about my pure math classes. The requirements are: one differential equations class, a real analysis class, two algebra classes, one topology class, one additional analysis class (manifolds, functional analysis, or Fourier analysis), one or two seminars (depending on whether you took the “communication-intensive” version of real analysis or another “communication-intensive” class), and at least two additional math classes of your choosing. Here’s a page describing the communciation-intensive math classes–basically, they’re math classes with a heavy writing/presentation component, so that math majors learn how to talk and write (in LaTeX ) about their work. I recently realized that I am almost done with my major requirements (as in, I just dropped the one remaining class that would fill them out. It has been very abstract and mentally demanding but also satisfying). My college math classes require a lot more mental legwork than my high school ones did, in the sense that I’ve had to do much more struggling and wrestling with many new abstract concepts in my head for long periods of time, and it has been difficult! But worth it!! Differences from high school: I think I came into college with the expectation that my classes would be noticeably harder and more time-consuming than they were in high school, and for the most part that turned out to be true, though they ramped up in difficulty gradually rather than all at once. However, I also used to have the sense that I could learn anything I wanted as fast as I wanted, and I have definitely changed my mind on this front and come to terms with my limits in the past 2.5 years of school. One thing I want to note is that if you don’t think high-school math is particularly exciting or do math competitions, but you like to think about abstract concepts, please do keep an open mind about college math classes! My math classes in high school demanded a lot of memorization, and the problem-solving often turned out to be pretty algorithmic. Apply the concept you learned in class to a problem like the one from class, but with different numbers. After a certain amount of “training,” a sizeable chunk of competition math was like this for me, too. Specifically, I got better at math competitions by taking a lot of old practice tests, so that many of the problems I encountered were variations on old problems I had seen before. I guess I performed moderately well at math competitions, and they were part of what made me want to come to MIT, but I don’t think they were particularly good at showing me what being a math major would be like. Some things haven’t changed—as in high school, it helps to do practice problems, so you’re familiar with all the possible concepts and theorems you might be able to apply on an exam. It’s just that now there isn’t often enough time to practice enough, depending on what the rest of your schedule looks like. Also, there’s less emphasis on memorizing material for exams, and homework is often weighted equally with exams. As a whole, homework is served in larger chunks than it is in high school, so it’s important to learn to manage your time. There are also fewer examples in class and fewer problems that are near identical to those in the textbook. Finally, a big change is that everything is proof-based (as I write this, I struggle to remember what it meant for math to not be proof-based). You’re basically given an ever-expanding toolbox of definitions and lemmas and theorems and have to tinker until you can assemble them into solutions to the problems you’re asked to solve—it is a creative activity with strict rules and very little grounding in reality and applications. A great benefit of college math classes (besides GIRs) is that they’re full of people who actively like to think about math, and hopefully, if you’re a math major, you think math is pretty cool, too. It’s nice doing math with no expectation that it will be applicable in any way. I recently had to teach a section of a textbook for my math seminar, and it was all about applying the theory in the previous sections of the book to a physics problem (the displacement of a cantilever beam at rest with only the force of gravity acting on it, if you’re interested!!!). Even though I was tasked with presenting this part of the book, it was definitely not the section of the book I would consider the most interesting. I personally thought the fact that the material was applicable to a physics problem was much less exciting than the proofs in the previous sections. I am pretty sure no one is taking that seminar to learn about the ways in which math is applicable to physics. The main trend I have noticed is that math in college is much more intellectually stimulating and abstract than what I encountered in high school. By the way, if you’re at all peeved by the way math is taught in your high school, or curious about what math is like when it’s separated from its applications, I urge you to read Lockhart’s Lament , which was required reading for the communication-intensive real analysis class (18.100C, now renamed 18.100Q) I took my freshman spring. It criticizes math education in grade school and argues that math is an artistic and creative pursuit that is not taught as such—but should be. He laments the fact that students find math boring and suggests that the mainstream pedagogy is at fault. Struggles: It really helps to develop a strong intuitive understanding of the material you’re learning, although sometimes it gets difficult because there are no good analogies to real life. Sometimes you get stuck rereading a definition over and over and over, trying to flip back to earlier definitions that the current definition refers to in an effort to regain understanding of all the concepts that the concept at hand relies on, but to no avail, because there’s some other relevant concept from a math class you took two years ago that you need to revisit, so you look it up on Wikipedia, but by the time you understand it again, you forget what you were originally looking at, so you’re left scrambling to retrace the string of things you referred to, and at this point you still haven’t even started to solve the actual problem… Sometimes. But most of the time it’s not that bad. Sometimes it’s just tedious, and sometimes you have to write out long expressions with a lot of symbols in order to rigorously explain something that’s much easier to explain intuitively. Lockhart’s Lament is nice, but at some point you also have to buckle down and slosh around in tedium and make sure that all your symbols are written correctly. Getting used to math in college and dealing with impostor’s syndrome: I took 18.022 my freshman fall and found that it helped ease me into the sort of proofs and thinking that the rest of my math classes required. Perhaps if I had jumped immediately into 18.100 I would have been overwhelmed; I know for sure that I wouldn’t have been able to handle 18.701. There are people who can, and seeing other freshmen sail through more advanced classes definitely freaked me out at times and stoked my first touches of impostor’s syndrome. Now, though, I don’t think I can adequately stress the importance of not going too fast. Because math classes often rely on definitions and material from prerequisites, these prerequisites are often super useful, unless you’ve actually learned the exact material from the class you want to skip. Of course, there are exceptions, but I often find it a lot more difficult to grasp mathematical concepts that I’ve forgotten or skipped than to pick up other new material, like a programming language. I took 18.701 sophomore fall, and I attempted to take 18.702 last spring, but I ended up dropping it because I was overwhelmed by all the other stuff I was trying to do/learn. I was taking 18.125 concurrently. This semester, I once again made the poor choice of taking three math classes simultaneously, but I ended up dropping one of them last week because I simply could not handle it. I did not have enough time or energy to wrap my head around all the material, and I’m finally ( finally ) coming to recognize the importance of learning things well and deeply rather than learning them as fast as possible. Bear in mind that this sequence just happens to be what I ended up with, and it is not a recommendation that everybody should take those classes in this order. I am hesitant to give general advice about what classes to take and when because it depends so much on your personal background and how much time you have to devote to the class! A relevant article about impostor’s syndrome and the feeling of “racing” to learn math is “ The Wrong Way to Treat Child Geniuses ” by Jordan Ellenberg, a former “child prodigy” who is now a math professor at UW-Madison. This one might be particularly relevant to people who didn’t grow up being praised for being “good at math” or winning awards at math competitions. (This one’s also particularly hard to access without a WSJ subscription, sigh…) I’ve reproduced a relevant paragraph below: One of the most painful aspects of teaching mathematics is seeing my students damaged by the cult of the genius. That cult tells students that it’s not worth doing math unless you’re the best at math–because those special few are the only ones whose contributions really count. We don’t treat any other subject that way. I’ve never heard a student say, “I like ‘Hamlet,’ but I don’t really belong in AP English–that child who sits in the front row knows half the plays by heart, and he started reading Shakespeare when he was 7!” Basketball players don’t quit just because one of their teammates outshines them. But I see promising young mathematicians quit every year because someone in their range of vision is “ahead” of them. I think that MIT students, especially freshmen, are prone to psyching themselves out comparing themselves to all the people around them who have won the IMO or who were doing calculus in middle school—but Ellenberg points out that this type of thinking sounds absurd when applied to other fields and skills–and there is no reason that it should apply to math more than any other field. One of the first math majors I met at MIT had never done math competitions in high school and hadn’t had much exposure to higher-level math (i.e. calculus and beyond) coming into MIT, but he loved the math classes he was taking in college, so he began to register for more and more of them until he was thinking seriously about pursuing it as a profession. He was initially intimidated by his peers but enjoyed math so much that it was not a chore at all for him to devote significant amounts of time to mastering his coursework. He later became involved in research and is now pursuing his PhD in math at MIT! In summary, if you think math is cool, please consider continuing to study it in college, but bear in mind that college classes aren’t exactly like high school classes. And if you don’t think math is cool, maybe it hast to do with the way math is taught in your school. Or maybe not–not everyone is destined to be a math major! And if you’re intimidated and convinced that you’ll never be “good enough at math”, because other people seem to be so far “ahead,” well that’s almost certainly not the case–it’s much more important that you enjoy the subject and don’t try to jump ahead so quickly that you lose enjoyment of the subject in an attempt to “catch up.” If anyone has specific questions about classes or anything like that, I would also be happy to try to help you individually. I know I have been pretty absent from the blogs–life update coming soon–but I’m getting back in the swing of things. Sending you all strength and luck for pi day and all subsequent college and major choosing!

'19 Art, science, and agriculture in Palestine April 29, 2019 in Academics & Research , Class Projects , Classes , MIT Life , Projects , Study Abroad , Travel , Uncategorized View all To set the mood: Feeling Blue “When I’m in New York I listen to Palestinian hip hop, but when I’m in Palestine, I listen to the blues.” — Nida Sinnokrot, Palestine Blues Spring break, I embarked on a site visit to a small village next to Ramallah, Palestine, with my HASS class, 4.314 Common Ground: Art, Science & Agriculture , offered under the MIT Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT) . I signed up for this class out of the blue, not really knowing what I was getting myself into. The syllabus sounded interesting, and I wanted to do something totally out of the ordinary, something beyond the confines of computer science or even STEM. The course description read: The history of art is also a history of agriculture, marking humanity’s complex relationship with the land…In this era of impending climate catastrophe, it is essential to seek diverse knowledges and build new narratives around humanity’s relationship to the environment. and suggested that we’d: examine historic typologies of Palestinian architectural and agrarian technologies, bringing them into conversation with contemporary technoscientific and artistic discourses … and travel to Palestine over spring break to study Sakiya’s physical site and work with the local community to build prototypes of their projects. After the first class, I was sold. I even passed up an offer to skate in a charity show the weekend we’d depart for Palestine. But this was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I took a leap of faith and was ready to be out of my depth. I was also looking into ways I could intersect my technical background with an entirely different domain. I mean…what better time to try than senior spring? We spent the first day exploring the Old City of Jerusalem and some of its holy sites. I was amazed with the hustle and bustle and the flow of people, conversation, and goods to and from shops and storefronts and in between narrow and winding footpaths and alleyways and streetcorners. After enjoying a refreshing family-style breakfast consisting of generous portions of various varieties of fresh humus, spreads, vegetables, and breads, we did some shopping, picked up some local pastries and fruits, and headed to the Rockefeller Museum , exploring a rich collection of local archaeological artifacts dating back to some of the world’s oldest civilizations. We then crossed some checkpoints and arrived at the base of Sakiya, the top accessed only by foot (or donkey). After a short but challenging hike up to the top of the main hill, we were rewarded by the most stunning sunset, the perfect culmination of a long day’s worth of travels and sightseeing. It was absolutely breathtaking, a sunset I’ll never forget. I’m still in awe. The next morning, we explored historic dry-stone walls and mintars (dry-stone homes) that weave in and out of the landscape, and began our week-long inquiry into the local flora and fauna of the landscape as well. With the help of an agroecological professor, we engaged in a survey of the local wild relatives —including the ancestors of modern wheat and legumes, and even snacked on wild asparagus, almonds, mustard grass, and other tasty delights—and discussed the ecological impact of modern-day agricultural practices and technology in the region. Before we arrived, my group prototyped a rocket stove to be developed and tested on site as part of our midterm project. We tested a scaled down version out of clay on campus, but one afternoon, we decided to test one on site out of the same stones used for the dry-stone walls. Bridging their separate domain expertise into the intersection of art, science, and agriculture, my classmates worked on their own projects on site: soil chromatography, seed bombs, ceramics, glass-blowing, 3D imaging, and more. The last few years, I’ve pursued human-computer interaction through various UROPs, classes, and projects. Since taking this course, however, I’ve surprised myself in starting to break away from human-centered exceptionalism and explore the implications of putting human-centric mental models at the forefront without a second thought on their impact on ecological sustainability. Often, classes and even projects seem too theoretical and impractical beyond the confines of the classroom or academia, but this class has completely transformed the way I think and approach problem-solving. The literature we’ve read and discussed in class has enabled me to rationalize much more critically and intentionally about the things I build and my relationship with the land we live on, the technology we use, and the systems, infrastructure, and power dynamics that govern our communities—more so than any class I’ve taken, ever . In fact, the most interesting classes I’ve taken have been my HASS classes, whether it’s in history, political science, theater arts, or languages. Each semester, it’s nice to take a step back from the psets and exams, explore a different domain, take on different modes of inquiry, make connections, explore parallels and alternate perspectives, and use all that to better inform how I approach my work within Course 6. This class, not only brought me to the other side of the globe, but has opened up an entirely new domain of inquiry that I’ll continue to debate and explore far beyond the confines of this course. For my final project, however, although I intended not to work on anything digital or technical, I ended up focusing on a project that involves sensors and microcontrollers. You can never escape those hardy Arduinos! One afternoon, I quickly prototyped a mini weather station to collect temperature, humidity, and magnetic field data in a portable unit, and went around the hillside to capture data in dry-stone walls all around the site. I’m now using what I learned on site to design the next iteration of my project back here on campus. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I loved how fresh and wholesome the foods we ate were. A local family cooked many of our midday meals and suppers with ingredients sourced locally, many even coming from Sakiya’s land too. Freshly baked pitas, rich humus, goat cheese, and labneh (thick yogurt), smooth olive oil and za’atar (dried thyme), refreshing tomatoes and cucumbers and citrus—I can still taste and smell it all. We also tried stretchy ice cream , the predecessor to the ice cream we know and eat today. This was by far my favorite delicacy. The texture is so unique and fun and delicious, even in its plain form. Our professor suggested we all try the “taste of childhood,” a colorful combination of various fruity flavors popular amongst the younger crowd. Another favorite of mine is kanafeh , a hot desert made from sweetened cheese and other toppings. On a morning off, we got a chance to explore Ramallah and its shops and street-side vendors. Even in the morning, the whole city was bustling with people and energy. Another afternoon, we got a private tour of the Palestinian Museum and a sneak preview of its newest exhibition, Intimate Terrains: Representations of a Disappearing Landscape , quite pertinent to the themes that we’ve been discussing in class. Each piece was centered around one of the four themes: erasure , loss , fragmentation , and resistance , and how these themes can apply to any part of the world. Our professor even has a piece in the exhibition that we got to check out. I spent most of the week off the grid. I cherished being temporarily outside the campus bubble, on a completely different continent, mostly disconnected from news, social media, and the drudgery of responding to emails, putting all my work for my other classes on pause. This was spring break after all. Our days started fairly early and ended pretty late. But my goal for this trip was to soak everything in, the environment, people, and stories, apply what we’ve learned in class earlier in the semester in a true Mens et Manus fashion, find inspiration for my final project, my life, my career, and appreciate each and every moment we had here. I spent many hours hiking, climbing rocks, exploring the hillside terrain and ecology, taking pictures, playing with Tutti the dog and Shareefa the donkey (my two new habibi ‘s!), and sitting and staring out into the mountains, reflecting and internalizing my experiences here. There is something just so beautiful about this place, Sakiya, so raw, pure and authentic. Maybe it’s because the landscape feels oddly familiar. It reminds me much of where I grew up in the Bay Area and the unique Mediterranean climate it offers. Here, I was content and relaxed. Near the end of the week, we spent an evening at a home of a local artist and, for hours and hours, were captivated by all these absolutely incredibly powerful and moving stories of strength, resilience, and beauty of the land and people through a showcase of a wide variety of Palestinian art pieces. As I look back and reminisce about the week, beyond the stunning sunsets and landscape, I will forever cherish how warm and welcoming everyone was to each of us throughout our trip. It has hard to say goodbye. شكراً Post Tagged #4.314 #act #agriculture #Art #science #spring break Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

'19 Kevin S. '19 Course 6-3 [email protected] Biography Hello! I’m Kevin, and I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the sun shines for most of the year, it never snows, rain isn’t really a thing. Basically, it's chill all day every day. Since I was 6, I’ve spent the majority of my life in frigid ice rinks. I’m a figure skater on Team USA, which means I’m often out and about traveling to destinations across the globe for training and competitions. Throughout my travels, I’ve gotten accustomed to living out of a suitcase on months on end. Stuffing my suitcases so full but barely topping out the weight limit has become second nature. Aside from being a nomadic rink rat, I also love good food, books, movies, music, and photography. My life wouldn’t be complete without late night food runs, Netflix marathons, or impossibly-long Snapchat stories. And in case you were wondering, I have no clue what I want to do with my life. But, hey, that’s what the next 4 years are for, right? tl;dr: MIT HERE I COME. Recent Posts 12 / Let’s try law school What's a computer scientist doing in DC? by Kevin S.

'20 Joonho K. '20 Course 6-3 [email protected] Biography One day, my kindergarten teacher called me Joon instead of Joonho during attendance and the nickname of sorts has stuck. You can call me whichever. :D Before settling into East Campus (and then Next House), I lived the majority of my life on a rather flat piece of land called Long Island, New York. Here are some of the things I like (to do): write (poetry) (especially at ridiculous hours like 3am) play euphonium (it’s like a mini tuba) singing streetlight manifesto in the shower minimalistic playing cards fuzzy socks abelian groups take pretty pictures!* *I’m just starting to get into photography and I bought my first DSLR over the summer, so you are now at the mercy of my amateur photography muahahahah My weakness is that I become interested in a new thing every other week and proceed to spend an arguably detrimental proportion of my time on said thing. I think my blogs will follow this same trend, for better or for worse. I love to write and I love sharing things with others. I hope you’ll find some happiness or usefulness in the twisty, windy journey through MIT that I will share with you. :) Recent Posts since i’ve been home by Joonho K.

'15 Goodbye GIRs and Intro Classes, hello course 6! October 6, 2012 in Academics & Research , Best of the Blogs , Classes With another add date passing and classes in full swing, I thought I’d take a moment to tell you guys what I’m up to for the semester. This semester is going to be class heavy because I’m doubling up on HASS classes to make up for a humanities free freshman spring semester. Finishing 6.01 and 6.042 (both intro classes to course 6-3 that I absolutely despised) last semester I’m finally able to jump into a couple of the CS classes that interest me. The report is in after 4 weeks and I absolutely love all of my classes.  After genuinely considering changing my major at the end of last semester, it’s a nice change of pace. 6.006 Introduction To Algorithms – 12 Unit This has to be my favorite class so far. Professor Rivest (the R in RSA encryption and CLRS) and Professor Indyk (a leader in the field of Computational Geometry) are both wonderful lecturers and the material is not only relevant but extremely useful in everyday coding life. A staple course for anyone hoping to have technical interviews, 006 has yet to disappoint. 6.034 Artificial Intelligence – 12 Units 034 is a class that I’m slowly enjoying more and more. Hearing mixed reviews about Winston and his no electronics policy I was wary coming in but all my fears have dissipated. Professor Winston is an amazingly consistent lecturer whose multi colored chalk and well prepared lectures make the 10am time slot worth it. 6.004 Computation Structures – 12 Units 004 is the course 6 class that everyone recommends you take before you judge the major. Starting from transistors you move your way up digital logic and at the end of the class have your own virtual 32bit processor. And with the class being taught the same way for over 18 semesters there are a ton of resources and help to be found. On top of that, the lecturer, Professor Terman, is wonderful and amazingly consistent. 21F.571 Japanese 1 – 9 Units (kind of) To clarify the “kind of”, whenever you take a language course with globalization both of them become 9 unit classes (this is for freshman with a credit cap) but you do all the work of your 12 unit counterparts. Japanese is an interesting class that keeps you on your feet with 2-3 quizzes a week. Every day is filled with situational sentence drilling and grammar lessons. While I love the language, it’s definitely a difficult class and I wonder how it’ll end up. 21F.076 Globalization – 9 Units The idea behind Globalization is to offer a CI-H that you can take with a language class without falling behind in your HASS requirement. Going from no hass classes to two this semester has been an interesting change of pace that’s led to hundreds of pages of readings. While I still have mixed feelings about this class it’s no doubt that both of the professors are splendid. Professor Resnick’s stories alone make this class worth it. ES.200 ESG Teaching Seminar – 6 Units A requirement to TA in ESG, this class is a great time to sit down, eat ice cream and discuss what it takes to be a great TA. This class is an amazing end to stressful weeks.

It wasn’t until I took a moment to sit [&#8230;] <p>A year back I developed a deep interest in understanding what made me who I am. This all started when moving to Cambridge for a year caused a bit of a culture shock that made me want to better understand my personal biases and cultural influences. It wasn’t until I took a moment to sit down and write my opinions on personal and political matters and create a map of what influenced those opinions that I had a better understanding of how my Ethiopian and American roots played a part. For example, I get disproportionately disappointed when a friend is eating near me and doesn’t offer me a bite. 99.999% of the time I don’t actually want the food but the Ethiopian side of me is so used to people begging you to eat their food that it’s become deeply engrained in who I am. The other side of the coin was about understanding where a lot of my opinions actually come from. Growing up, and up until recently, I was a serial flip-flopper. No opinion I held was ever set in stone. All it took was a conflicting opinion from a person that I admired to switch sides completely and abandon any ties to the other side. It was so bad that I would leave a movie having really enjoyed it, hear a friend of mine didn’t like the movie, and would go find reasons why my original opinion was invalid. I found it so difficult to define who I was because I was just a jigsaw puzzle of other people’s opinions. In making this map of opinions I could pinpoint the people and years that my current set of opinions was made of. Now I’m not saying it is bad to be influenced by those around you, in fact that’s how it should be, my problem was that I took these opinions at face value and never questioned them.</p>\n<p>Now you’re probably wondering how any of this is related to MIT or college life in general, or at least I hope that’s what you’re thinking so I can continue with this train of thought. Going to university puts you in a dorm with dozens of people with conflicting ideas. There will almost certainly be times where you have to agree to disagree but talking with people you disagree with forces you to look inwardly in a way that you cannot survive only justifying your opinions at face value. There have been tons of times where I blurt something out, someone calls me out and I have to respond “oh man, you’re right, sorry”. The first few times this would happen I would leave frustrated and dejected but eventually it became a series of growing experiences. I’ve found a group of friends who will question anything I say and vice versa and it has without a doubt been one of the most rewarding parts of college.</p>\n<p>Now if you’ll allow the non-linear nature of this post to continue I want to jump back to my first week in Cambridge and the conversation that sparked all of this. I was having tea with a pair of guys I had met the night before and the topic came to American politics, as a large chunk of my conversations did. We were talking about domestic spying and one of the guys was adamant about the “if you’ve done nothing wrong, you shouldn’t have anything to hide”. This was an argument I was used to but as I listed reasons to reconsider, none of them were landing. We agreed to disagree and parted ways but the more I thought about it the more I realized that a lot of my arguments made assumptions that were specific to Americans and more specifically American college students. That a general distrust of your government isn’t a trait that all countries of the world share and that it was my time spent learning about the US government that had pushed me to these feelings. As the year continued there were many other cultural differences that reared their heads in the places I least expected them. Reading about and immersing myself in this different culture helped me better understand the motivations, opinions and actions of those around me and this was invaluable.</p>\n<p>When I came back to MIT and had a chance to choose the HASS-S class that would round out my graduation requirements I leaned towards sociology to be able to take a scientific approach to everything that I’ve talked about above. The class has done a wonderful job of not only helping me better understand what happened in my time at Cambridge but also better understand my interactions with people at MIT. If you get a chance to take the class, I highly recommend it!</p>\n<p>At the end of the day I don’t think I’ve fully answered the question “who am I?”. Every attempt just raises more questions that require more time to elaborate on. But this is a good start. I&#8217;m a jigsaw puzzle of influenced opinions.</p> Blizzard Barbecuing https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blizzard-barbecuing/ Natnael G.

The titles [&#8230;] <p>Hello all, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done a Hidden Treasures at (and around) MIT so I thought I would bring it back with something I&#8217;ve taken full advantage of this year.</p>\n<h1>Department Lectures</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 396px;\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Presentations.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For anyone that&#8217;s used the elevators in Stata this is a common sight that&#8217;s usually ignored. The titles are in another language, the paragraphs of text are incomprehensible and there&#8217;s a severe lack of the word FOOD in bright red text. To be fair these posters are targeted to professors and graduate students but they present a learning opportunity for undergrads that you can&#8217;t find in most classes.</p>\n<p>The first opportunity is an insight into what&#8217;s actually happening in the fields that you are interested in. A lot of the research that is being done is years from becoming practical and even longer from being taught in classes. I see it as a glimpse into the future and a look at what you might be working on if you go to grad school.</p>\n<p>The second opportunity is through communication with professors. If you sit through a lecture and find you like what you see, there is a whole room of professors to talk to about the subject. This is both great for finding UROP/MEng advisors as well as getting your name out there if you&#8217;re considering grad school.</p>\n<p>The third opportunity is seeing how professors and grad students learn from lectures. Every other slide is filled with dozens of questions about everything from how this works with [INSERT PAPER HERE] to why certain assumptions are necessary. While this level of probing is not possible in 300 person lecture halls, they do become more feasible in smaller capstone classes. It&#8217;s also entertaining to see professors taking the student role. My favorite interaction went like this (paraphrased of course)</p>\n<p><strong>Prof:</strong> Do you use [INSERT THEOREM] as part of your protocol?<br />\n<strong>Presenter:</strong> Yea, that was a bullet on my last slide.<br />\n<strong>Prof:</strong> You didn&#8217;t bold it! I don&#8217;t read bullets that aren&#8217;t bolded!</p>\n<h1>Final Project Presentations</h1>\n<p>2.009 is probably the final project presentation that you have heard of (if not see Kirsten&#8217;s amazing blog on it <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/adventure\">here</a>) but for every 2.009 there are dozens of other capstone presentations that you don&#8217;t hear about. Nearly every major has them and they give you a glimpse into what you&#8217;ll be able to do a few years down the line. My advice is to make a list of the classes that you&#8217;re interested in finishing your major with and attending as many final presentations as you can. They won&#8217;t all be as spectacular as 2.009 but they tend not to disappoint. This semester I was able to make it to four presentation and it&#8217;s mind blowing how far people branch off after GIRs. I swear the course 2&#8217;s are doing magic in that Papa Smurf Lab(I think that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s callled?

Next we hit a series of novels that starts with <em>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, my favorite series of all time.

Could you imagine how much I could get done with two extra arms? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2zo0JN2HE\">Luckily, NCIS has tackled the question.</a></p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/mit-breakthrough-makes-tiny-apartments-feel-three-times-1582146037?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_source=gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">New York Apartments To Finally Be Hospitable</a></h1>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/f8giE7i7CAE\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Having lived in the primarily rural, occasionally suburban, land of Kansas for the last 14 years, I have a largely different definition of how much living space is necessary than my urban dwelling classmates do.

As a kid who went to a high school with an aerospace program, every one of us had read Rocket Boys and looked forward to a future with commercial space travel. While it&#8217;s probably still infeasible from a financial point of  view the news that Elon Musk&#8217;s company SpaceX has unveiled the second iteration in their manned space ship gives us hope that the commercial option is not too far off and maybe I&#8217;ll be able to afford it in my lifetime.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/science/scientists-report-finding-reliable-way-to-teleport-data.html?_r=2\">Quantum Teleportation &#8211; A.K.A Magic</a></h1>\n<p>In a previous life(a.k.a 4 years ago) I wanted to be a physicist because it was articles like this that made me excited about the world. It does a wonderful job of taking the reader step by step through what you think teleportation is, a formal definition of teleportation and how this new research achieves this goal. And the best part is that this teleportation is used to send bits of data. In a world where the speed of light is a limiting factor in all of our transmission of data, this is an interesting way of sidestepping the current issues.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/01/google-making-internet-satellites/\">Google Believes Everyone Should Have Access to Cat Videos</a></h1>\n<p>As a fairly strong proponent of the internet, and all of the good that it&#8217;s spread can do, I enjoy following philanthropic efforts to do just this.

The show was funny, the games were interesting, and it helped kindle a deep love of TableTop gaming. I burnt through all of the episodes in about a week or two and word on the street was that they were going to try to Crowdfund season 3. After a few weeks of doing just that, they&#8217;ve exceeded their goals and will be able to make 20 episodes and a Role-Playing Game show.

I&#8217;ve been reading The Blade Itself sporadically since December but it was becoming increasingly difficult to remember names or what&#8217;s going on.

A huge fan of the original three movies (yes, even the third one)  Spider-Man 2 was always one of my favorite movies and this movie knocked it of its throne.

Sceptical about the title for this one I put off reading it and spent my free time catching up on a few fantasy books. After finishing The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear I decided to pick it up and enjoy the beautiful Spring weather. What I found was a wonderful book filled with useful tips and dozens of anecdotes of when these simple steps made a big difference in how a few greats, such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie, ran the country and their businesses.

One thing most of them have in common though are the scale and weight of the exams.</p>\n<p>Another non-trivial difference between academics at Cambridge and MIT is the way exams and grades work. MIT runs under a continuous assessment school of thought. Throughout the semester you&#8217;ll take 1-3 tests + final and have quite a few problem sets/labs/papers that are continually assessing your knowledge. At Cambridge there is significantly less graded coursework. The supervision work I talked about last week is only graded for your benefit and doesn&#8217;t contribute to your final grade. With that said though the supervisors provide reports where they predict how you&#8217;ll do on the corresponding paper of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW7Op86ox9g\">EXAMS</a>. 1B Computer Scientists have 4 courses that do have graded coursework though.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Further Java &#8211; Six once a week labs during first term. Automatically graded via online ticker with a pass/fail system. (Similar to 6.005 but labs are all or nothing) Also have to orally defend your code in a short code interrogation.</li>\n<li>E-CAD/Architecture Practicals &#8211; Similar to further java, two long term labs with a similar questioning.</li>\n<li>C/C++ or Prolog &#8211; Lecture based classes with a programming assignment at the end of term where you have to meet with the corresponding professor to talk about your work.</li>\n<li>Group Projects &#8211; A term long group project graded both individually and as a group.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind for all of this graded coursework is that they are all based on ticks, a pass/fail system where it&#8217;s all or nothing. And until early June that is all that is graded. Once June hits you take EXAMS.</p>\n<h1>Exam Structure</h1>\n<p>There are 4 papers that are each 9-10 questions long. You have 3 hours for each paper and choose 5 questions to answer on each one. What this means is that you can answer questions for subjects you&#8217;re more comfortable with and ignore classes (*cough*ComputerGraphics*cough) all together. These four papers will collectively cover 20 examinable subjects of which 16 have been covered already. Compsci exams are June 2nd-5th. Luckily we have two hefty 5 week breaks to revise all this material, which is exactly what everyone does.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what a day revising looks like.</p>\n<h1>8:00am Waking Up</h1>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial that I wake up early because while I won&#8217;t BE productive for the next three hours, I&#8217;ll definitely FEEL productive(arguably more important). Now that I&#8217;m awake I can hit snooze for an hour.</p>\n<h1>9:00am Getting Up</h1>\n<p>After the umpteenth alarm goes off I&#8217;ll finally muster up the power to roll out of bed and grab some breakfast making materials. I swipe open the curtains and let out a small groan as my eyes blink themselves awake. With bagels, a tea bag and some peanut butter in hand I make the small trek to the kitchen to start my day.</p>\n<h1>9:15am Eating Breakfast and Interneting</h1>\n<p>Once breakfast is made I usually head back to my room to enjoy the actual eating portion. Because my hands are in use this is the perfect time to catch up on all the wonderful video content the Americans have released while I was sleeping. After that I&#8217;ll watch an episode of whatever TV show I&#8217;m following (currently Samurai Champloo) and make the mistake of going on Reddit. A short time warp later.</p>\n<h1>11:00am Fishing For Excuses</h1>\n<p>It&#8217;s about this time that any feeling of productivity I felt for waking up early is completely gone. I&#8217;ll usually glance over at my pile of papers</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 525px;\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-07-23_30_56.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>and desperately look for excuses to not start studying. A quick peek in the bathroom shows me that my body wash is going to run out! Well, I can&#8217;t have that now, better get dressed and cycle down to Sainsbury&#8217;s.</p>\n<h1>11:20am Sainsbury&#8217;s Run</h1>\n<p>Man, I&#8217;m feeling more productive already. Wait, is that Ernesto &#8217;15 over there! We still haven&#8217;t planned our trip to Amsterdam, I wonder if he&#8217;s busy.</p>\n<h1>11:30am Planning A Trip</h1>\n<p>After a quick chat with Ernesto we&#8217;ve decided to plan the whole trip today. This is a day of productivity packed in a few hours, I&#8217;m so glad I was running out of body wash.</p>\n<h1>1:00pm Grabbing Lunch</h1>\n<p>I say my goodbyes, cycle back home and start to make lunch. 15 minutes later my delicious ramen is ready to be consumed.</p>\n<h1>1:15pm Eating Lunch and More Interneting</h1>\n<p>&lt;See Eating Breakfast and Interneting&gt;</p>\n<h1>3:00pm Getting Serious</h1>\n<p>At this point all the feelings of productivity have washed away. I&#8217;ve realized that planning the trip was productive but it also means that I&#8217;ll be out of comission for 3 full days. Time to start studying. But first I need to find some music/tv/movies for background noise.</p>\n<h1>3:15pm Actual Studying</h1>\n<p>Everyone studies differently but this is how I prefer to do it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go through all of the notes and summarize them.</li>\n<li>Do practice problems and figure out what my weaknesses are.</li>\n<li>Read solutions and mark my work.</li>\n<li>LaTeX my summaries/problem answers(If I&#8217;m feeling particularly keen)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>5:00pm Dinner And More Time Wasting!</h1>\n<p>&lt;See Eating Lunch and More Interneting&gt;</p>\n<h1>8:00pm Give Up</h1>\n<p>It&#8217;s around this point everyday that I realize how much of the day has been wasted. Once I&#8217;ve made this realization I slack off a little bit more and make some final attempt to feel productive. I&#8217;ll either go back to studying, start a blog post or take a walk. And then I&#8217;ll hype myself up for the CRAZY amount of work I&#8217;m going to get done tomorrow.</p>\n<h1>10:00pm Snack And TV</h1>\n<p>Well, if the day is shot anyway might as well watch another episode of Samurai Champloo.</p>\n<h1>12:00am Sleep</h1>\n<p>Need my beauty sleep to get up at 8 for the insane amount of work I&#8217;m going to get done.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And then repeat ad nauseum. At this rate I&#8217;ll be ready for exams by late September. October at the latest.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 6px;\">I know I used this joke on Facebook a few weeks ago.

'15 More Ramblings Of A Spring Semester Senior April 1, 2015 in How to Human , How to MIT , How to School How To Avoid Sounding Stupid* *All advice should be taken with a grain of salt/pepper/Adobo and a pinch of parsley. Don’t ask questions in class; everyone around you will think you’re stupid for not understanding the concept on the first try. Don’t ask the person sitting next to you to clarify what’s on the board; they’ll ridicule you for poor eye sight and tendency to zone out. Don’t ask for clarification in an argument; that’s a sign of weakness that will immediately result in losing. Don’t go to office hours; you don’t want the TAs to put a name to a face and judge all of the stupidity that ends up on your psets. Don’t admit you’re wrong, even in the face of undeniable evidence. You can always question its legitimacy later. Don’t ask your professors to proofread your essays; you don’t want to be there when they find out you can’t remember the difference between affect and effect. Don’t voice any of your opinions; chances are you haven’t thought it through and they will poke holes in everything you hold dear. Don’t leave your room; everyone will see your torn up shoes and tattered jeans and dismiss everything you say. Don’t chime in on discussions about things you haven’t mastered. What do you know about the Palestine Israel situation? There are people who dedicated their lives to the study. Actually, don’t do anything that would be considered “chiming in”. Don’t talk at all, your poor diction and heavy slang use will make you look uneducated and is there anything worse than that? Don’t ask for the definition of a word; just smile, nod, and Google it in your free time. Or, ignore all of this terrible advice because you’re paying for your education and it’s your job to make the most of it. Life became a lot easier when the phrase “I don’t know what that is/means” entered my repertoire.  In the words of Jake from Adventure Time Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

'15 Ramblings Of A Spring Semester Senior March 25, 2015 in MIT History & Culture , MIT Life A year back I developed a deep interest in understanding what made me who I am. This all started when moving to Cambridge for a year caused a bit of a culture shock that made me want to better understand my personal biases and cultural influences. It wasn’t until I took a moment to sit down and write my opinions on personal and political matters and create a map of what influenced those opinions that I had a better understanding of how my Ethiopian and American roots played a part. For example, I get disproportionately disappointed when a friend is eating near me and doesn’t offer me a bite. 99.999% of the time I don’t actually want the food but the Ethiopian side of me is so used to people begging you to eat their food that it’s become deeply engrained in who I am. The other side of the coin was about understanding where a lot of my opinions actually come from. Growing up, and up until recently, I was a serial flip-flopper. No opinion I held was ever set in stone. All it took was a conflicting opinion from a person that I admired to switch sides completely and abandon any ties to the other side. It was so bad that I would leave a movie having really enjoyed it, hear a friend of mine didn’t like the movie, and would go find reasons why my original opinion was invalid. I found it so difficult to define who I was because I was just a jigsaw puzzle of other people’s opinions. In making this map of opinions I could pinpoint the people and years that my current set of opinions was made of. Now I’m not saying it is bad to be influenced by those around you, in fact that’s how it should be, my problem was that I took these opinions at face value and never questioned them. Now you’re probably wondering how any of this is related to MIT or college life in general, or at least I hope that’s what you’re thinking so I can continue with this train of thought. Going to university puts you in a dorm with dozens of people with conflicting ideas. There will almost certainly be times where you have to agree to disagree but talking with people you disagree with forces you to look inwardly in a way that you cannot survive only justifying your opinions at face value. There have been tons of times where I blurt something out, someone calls me out and I have to respond “oh man, you’re right, sorry”. The first few times this would happen I would leave frustrated and dejected but eventually it became a series of growing experiences. I’ve found a group of friends who will question anything I say and vice versa and it has without a doubt been one of the most rewarding parts of college. Now if you’ll allow the non-linear nature of this post to continue I want to jump back to my first week in Cambridge and the conversation that sparked all of this. I was having tea with a pair of guys I had met the night before and the topic came to American politics, as a large chunk of my conversations did. We were talking about domestic spying and one of the guys was adamant about the “if you’ve done nothing wrong, you shouldn’t have anything to hide”. This was an argument I was used to but as I listed reasons to reconsider, none of them were landing. We agreed to disagree and parted ways but the more I thought about it the more I realized that a lot of my arguments made assumptions that were specific to Americans and more specifically American college students. That a general distrust of your government isn’t a trait that all countries of the world share and that it was my time spent learning about the US government that had pushed me to these feelings. As the year continued there were many other cultural differences that reared their heads in the places I least expected them. Reading about and immersing myself in this different culture helped me better understand the motivations, opinions and actions of those around me and this was invaluable. When I came back to MIT and had a chance to choose the HASS-S class that would round out my graduation requirements I leaned towards sociology to be able to take a scientific approach to everything that I’ve talked about above. The class has done a wonderful job of not only helping me better understand what happened in my time at Cambridge but also better understand my interactions with people at MIT. If you get a chance to take the class, I highly recommend it! At the end of the day I don’t think I’ve fully answered the question “who am I?”. Every attempt just raises more questions that require more time to elaborate on. But this is a good start. I’m a jigsaw puzzle of influenced opinions.

'15 MIT's Best Kept Secret December 28, 2014 in Events , MIT History & Culture , MIT Life Hello all, it’s been a while since I’ve done a Hidden Treasures at (and around) MIT so I thought I would bring it back with something I’ve taken full advantage of this year. Department Lectures For anyone that’s used the elevators in Stata this is a common sight that’s usually ignored. The titles are in another language, the paragraphs of text are incomprehensible and there’s a severe lack of the word FOOD in bright red text. To be fair these posters are targeted to professors and graduate students but they present a learning opportunity for undergrads that you can’t find in most classes. The first opportunity is an insight into what’s actually happening in the fields that you are interested in. A lot of the research that is being done is years from becoming practical and even longer from being taught in classes. I see it as a glimpse into the future and a look at what you might be working on if you go to grad school. The second opportunity is through communication with professors. If you sit through a lecture and find you like what you see, there is a whole room of professors to talk to about the subject. This is both great for finding UROP/MEng advisors as well as getting your name out there if you’re considering grad school. The third opportunity is seeing how professors and grad students learn from lectures. Every other slide is filled with dozens of questions about everything from how this works with [INSERT PAPER HERE] to why certain assumptions are necessary. While this level of probing is not possible in 300 person lecture halls, they do become more feasible in smaller capstone classes. It’s also entertaining to see professors taking the student role. My favorite interaction went like this (paraphrased of course) Prof: Do you use [INSERT THEOREM] as part of your protocol? Presenter: Yea, that was a bullet on my last slide. Prof: You didn’t bold it! I don’t read bullets that aren’t bolded! Final Project Presentations 2.009 is probably the final project presentation that you have heard of (if not see Kirsten’s amazing blog on it here ) but for every 2.009 there are dozens of other capstone presentations that you don’t hear about. Nearly every major has them and they give you a glimpse into what you’ll be able to do a few years down the line. My advice is to make a list of the classes that you’re interested in finishing your major with and attending as many final presentations as you can. They won’t all be as spectacular as 2.009 but they tend not to disappoint. This semester I was able to make it to four presentation and it’s mind blowing how far people branch off after GIRs. I swear the course 2’s are doing magic in that Papa Smurf Lab(I think that’s what it’s callled? Idk, I don’t pretend to understand what goes on down there).

'15 Complete with Batman mask, kettle corn, and ticket stubs November 4, 2014 in MIT Life , Residential Life (Click to zoom) Panoramic look at my room in Random Hall, let’s zoom into some of the more interesting parts! On top we have a couple of props from my favorite movies/comics. The first shelf holds the crux of my media collection. It starts off with some classic newspaper comics, Calvin & Hobbes and Dilbert . From there it leads into the defining book of my childhood Squids will be Squids . From there we have a nice split of comics from the big two and independent distributors. Next we hit a series of novels that starts with The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy , my favorite series of all time. Last is a series of DVDs (and the occassional Wii game) that I’ve always loved, from A Knight’s Tale to Terminator 2 . The second shelf has a pair of blank white cardboard boxes that hold individual comics and various CCG cards. In the back there are a couple of CDs that mean a lot to me (from Regina Spektor’s What We Saw From The Cheap Seats to Outkast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below ) and a frisbee signed by the great Woodie Flowers! In front are a couple of coasters collected from my time in Munich. We start at the top with a scarf I picked up at a Barcelona football game followed by a poster I’ve had since sophomore year. It’s adorned with postcards and tickets on both sides from various concerts and museums. And finally we reach my pride and joy, the dual monitor battlestation that has been three years in the making. The final “interesting” wall has a group of posters. The two on the left are from an early Reddit Secret Santa gift exchange that I had a lot of fun participating in. I don’t remember where I got the third poster but hey, it has Spider-Man.

We&#8217;re called Contour now, not Pink Team, and we&#8217;re still figuring out how much of our name to capitalize. We’re digging into market research, learning the ins and outs of team formation, and testing our product with potential users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We held several events to show adMITs our laser cutter, teach them how to use it, and generate hype for MechE.

We&#8217;ve tested with a few outside people, but never a crowd of creative teenagers, and we were curious to see what people would come up with and how they would respond to our constraints. We set up our wood and paper, keychains and stickers and candy in the MechE Lounge, expecting about twenty people to stop by over the next two hours.</p>\n<p>Instead, there were about seventy.</p>\n<p>AdMITs who were all much taller than me filled the MechE Lounge, so much that getting from one side to the other felt like moving through a crowded dance floor. Their bodies blocked the light from the laser cutter; their voices covered the hum of the motors. People poured out of the MechE Lounge and filled the hallway.</p>\n<p>This was glorious and terrifying. I warned the back half of the line that the wait would be long. Contour takes about three minutes to cut out a small shape, so realistically we only had time for about 40 people to cut out their drawings. And that didn&#8217;t account for drawings that weren&#8217;t designed for laser cutters, or times the \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        CV<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-2\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-2\" href=\"#annotation-2\">02</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">computer vision</span>\n</span>\n software messed up.</p>\n<p>And sometimes the software messed up. We spent the first hour and a half with a sub-optimal set-up that led to a number of errors. After we switched things around, we could catch most errors early on, and cutting out shapes went a lot more smoothly.</p>\n<p>Once we got Contour on a roll, it worked so well! I loved watching the machine we&#8217;d built cut out so many designs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100118\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100118\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-100118\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-400x300.jpg\" alt=\"dragon\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-400x300.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-1000x750.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-800x600.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240412_183242146-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100118\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">viking boat dragon I drew</p></div>\n<p>By the time the event was over, there were still 24 hopeful adMITs. Some were holding multiple sheets of paper for their friends.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the team had to leave. There was just one person on Software left, and me. But we felt bad sending the adMITs away, when they&#8217;d waited so long. We kept cutting out projects for a half hour or so. Then my teammate had class, leaving me alone with the machine and small handful of remaining adMITs. I took over and kept cutting their projects.</p>\n<p>I was impressed by how creative everyone was. Some students were clearly artists, and beautiful, complicated shapes came easily to them. Others had no art background at all, and came up with creative ways to design interesting shapes. There were a lot of beavers and Wide Tims traced from phone screens.</p>\n<p>I finished cutting adMIT projects about thirty minutes after the event ended. Then I cut my own viking ship. Finally I cleaned up (another team member skipped a meeting to help me cart all of our supplies back), and began to rush to another meeting, thinking how I&#8217;d barely have time to grab food on the way&#8230; when I found a bench with five trays of Anna&#8217;s Taqueria. I grinned. The free food gods were rewarding me for my labors.</p>\n<p>I loved the adMITs&#8217; energy. They asked good questions about MechE and the workload at MIT, and I felt that as a senior, I was able to answer those better than I had been before. My answers weren&#8217;t universal &#8212; but I tried to keep them unbiased, to be clear about what biases I might have, and to emphasize the many paths different students take.</p>\n<p>I was left with a lot of insight and a lot of questions about where to take Contour from here.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-100117 aligncenter\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-400x366.jpg\" alt=\"dragon cutout\" width=\"300\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-400x366.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-1000x914.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-800x731.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-1536x1404.jpg 1536w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522-1400x1280.jpg 1400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20240418_191456756-scaled-e1713764765522.jpg 1796w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<h3>Meet the Bloggers</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I’ll be at our very own Meet the Bloggers, where we wear shirts with our faces on them, eat pie, and meet adMITs. The blogs have been such a wonderful thing to be part of these last four years. The bloggers were one of my first communities at MIT, during the covid year, and they were one of my strongest connections to the Institute when everything was shut down. Writing blogs taught me to tell stories about myself, to capture pieces of the real world and preserve them, which is different from writing reflections of the world in fiction. This skill has been so useful in blogging, poetry, and monologues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I talked with Jeremy about careers and PhDs. As I grow older, Jeremy and other staff have become the people in the blogger community I know best. I felt a bit older, a bit less entertained by whatever quirky thing I&#8217;d done &#8211; though interesting to imagine all the different ambers there could have been. Some people have an inevitability to them, if they went to [redacted] university they&#8217;d be much the same. But you &#8211; who would you be in Tucson? Who would you be in art school?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I didn’t have the words for it then but I do imagine those women &#8211; me in Tucson who might have learned to go to frat parties but wouldn’t have found spaces like B1, a group of majority queer, majority women who become the life of any dance floor. In Tucson she wouldn’t really emerge from being more of a nerd than most people around her. I thought of myself in \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        art school,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-3\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-3\" href=\"#annotation-3\">03</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">by this I mean literally any school that isn&#039;t MIT, where I would spend more time and effort on my creative writing degree; not &#039;art school&#039; per se but my experience of it would encompass more art</span>\n</span>\n my art getting </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">better;</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> maybe I’d be published by now. I&#8217;d be terrified for my career after the rise of AI. I don&#8217;t know who exactly I’d be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But in the meeting room I thought, I like the MIT version best. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100119\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100119\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-100119\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-400x300.jpeg\" alt=\"all of the bloggers!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-400x300.jpeg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-1000x750.jpeg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bloggers-met-1400x1050.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">bloggers, met</p></div>\n<h3>ASA Midway</h3>\n<p>Walking through Midway and talking to pre-frosh for a club was warm and bittersweet. I hadn&#8217;t been in that space since my own CPW in 2019, and again during sophomore REX. This time I knew so many people! Some of my friends have exec roles on \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        AAI<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-4\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-4\" href=\"#annotation-4\">04</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Asian American Initiative</span>\n</span>\n and \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        BSU<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-5\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-5\" href=\"#annotation-5\">05</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Black Students&#039; Union</span>\n</span>\n, and I learned that some of my teammates from MechE projects are also on \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Casino Rueda<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-6\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-6\" href=\"#annotation-6\">06</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Cuban salsa team</span>\n</span>\n and \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Divest,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-7\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-7\" href=\"#annotation-7\">07</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Environmental action club</span>\n</span>\n and friends I knew from classes are apparently in BioMakerspace and \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Mocha.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-8\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-8\" href=\"#annotation-8\">08</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">hip-hop dance team</span>\n</span>\n The list goes on, but you get the idea. I love the interconnectedness of MIT, how many passions people pour their time into.</p>\n<p>There was also a sort of nostalgia to passing by clubs I find compelling but never had the bandwidth to join. I wondered how my dancing or singing abilities might have improved with three years of dedicated practice. I&#8217;ll have more time to learn new skills after MIT, but finding spaces to learn with will be much more difficult. Mujeres Latinas and LUCHA also stood out to me; I&#8217;ve signed up for their mailing lists at various times, but never really went to meetings. I&#8217;ve found Latinx culture in my dorm communities and friendships instead. I know I can only be deeply invested in so many communities, and that I didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth for clubs until senior spring &#8212; but that may be different next year, and I looked up Hispanic graduate school clubs that evening.</p>\n<h3>Burton One B1athalon!</h3>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-100123 aligncenter\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n-400x713.jpg\" alt=\"b1athalon poster\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n-400x713.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n-1000x1781.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n-800x1425.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n-862x1536.jpg 862w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/435367410_1154203359349607_7140152293751389124_n.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px\" /></h3>\n<p>The \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        B1ners<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-9\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-9\" href=\"#annotation-9\">09</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">B1ner = boner = person who lives on Burton One.

I&#8217;m interested in topology, which is the study of flexible shapes like knots or rubber surfaces. We can&#8217;t use the traditional geometrical measurements like length or area to characterize these shapes since they aren&#8217;t rigid.

Of course I’m not the world’s greatest mathematician: I’ve done some interesting mathematics, but there are others who are more accomplished. If math were a competition to be the best, I might as well give up now, because I have no hope of “winning math” (whatever that might mean).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fortunately, that’s just not how it works. If someone else proves an amazing theorem, their achievement doesn’t make my work any less interesting or significant. Instead, the more we learn, the more fascinating and valuable mathematics as a whole becomes. We’re all working together to figure out the answers to questions we share an interest in. As in all human activities, there’s occasionally competition for jobs or prizes, but competition is not the point of mathematics. Other mathematicians are my friends and colleagues, not my rivals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The reason I want to emphasize this is because of how incredibly successful MIT students have been in the Putnam exam (see <a href=\"https://maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMC/AnnouncementOfWinnersFall2023.docx.pdf\">here</a>). There are many amazingly quick and insightful students at MIT, and I think people sometimes get the impression that success as a math major must mean being able to come up with ingenious solutions to carefully posed problems under time pressure. That’s an impressive skill, but it’s not the most important skill a mathematician can have, or necessary for success. It’s important to celebrate achievements in math competitions without letting them overshadow other forms of promise or achievement.\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <a id=\"annotation-trigger-15\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-15\" href=\"#annotation-15\">15</a>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Fatima: This answers a bunch of the questions that follow, but I didn&#039;t want to break it up because so true!!</span>\n</span>\n</span></p>\n<p>Jonathan: I enjoy the mystery of it. You&#8217;ll often see some patterns that you can&#8217;t explain, but after working hard to understand the objects better, the patterns become natural and inevitable.</p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&#8217;ve been interested in math for basically my whole life, initially through math competitions but now for the math itself, which I find both interesting and beautiful.</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&#8217;ve pretty much always been more interested in math than anything else. This has maintained since I was about four years old, despite the fact that what &#8220;math&#8221; means has changed a lot &#8212; from arithmetic to short-answer questions to olympiads to college classes and now to research. I&#8217;ve essentially followed the &#8220;path of most math&#8221; for most of my life up to this point: I considered studying CS or physics in college, but liked math more; I explored quantitative finance and software development, but preferred research math. I&#8217;m pretty happy with where this path has brought me, and there&#8217;s nothing else I&#8217;d rather be doing.</span></p>\n<p>Matthew: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I like the combination of intuition and rigor–I believe the former is more important to me, but I think being able to understand concepts from the ground up is satisfying. I also think that understanding the explanations of various phenomena through math is something that I value, which is why I take a lot of classes in subjects that aren’t math, but involve math to a reasonably high degree (for example: I took Systems Biology, where a large focus of the class was understanding how systems of molecules that regulate each other behave, which can be modeled using dynamical systems.)</span></p>\n<p>Misheel: I like doing math because I like the idea of figuring things out and/or understanding things. It&#8217;s really hard to say really general stuff, but if you assume a small number of reasonable things (axioms), then suddenly those concepts connect together and you get an explosion of connections and new concepts that you can learn and explore. I also play a lot of video games (or used to before college lol) so I like making video game analogies. In this case, the axioms are sort of like a seed for a world in minecraft and you explore what grows out of that seed and do cool stuff.</p>\n<p>Another analogy is that research in general feels like exploration as well, like exploring every corner of a room before moving on, and I enjoy that a lot. Running a \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        dfs<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-16\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-16\" href=\"#annotation-16\">16</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">depth first search</span>\n</span>\n in some \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        sense.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-17\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-17\" href=\"#annotation-17\">17</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Misheel: it is important to contrast the need for dfs in research with the danger of dfs in learning because if you dfs in learning, you really can&#039;t stop and you&#039;ll have very specific knowledge about a few fields but not a lot of foundation. so for studying bfs (breadth first search) is better or something.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>Zimi: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Good question, I don’t know if I would call myself someone who “does math” as I have not engaged too much in math besides taking classes.

So it&#8217;s difficult to teach math in a linear way! I wish I could continue my classes with students after a couple semesters, and circle back to old material with new context from other subjects they&#8217;ve learned.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What are your thoughts on the math department at MIT?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Jonathan: It&#8217;s really nice being surrounded by people (students and faculty alike) excited about math and working on such interesting problems!</p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MIT math department (including both pure and applied) is one of the best in the world, and in particular the undergrad math population has been insanely strong the past few years (see Putnam results&#8230;). It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that the standard course offerings are pretty comprehensive compared to other schools (I think), and usually well-taught.</span></p>\n<p>Zimi: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Math is one of the bigger departments at MIT so you get to meet a lot of people with many different interests!</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>What are your favorite things about the math department at MIT?</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan: cookies at tea time</p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I really appreciated the variety of course offerings, which covered everything I could dream of wanting to learn (and much, much more). Also, the other math majors: I learned a ton from the friends I made.</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MIT math department is rather large, and there&#8217;s a great breadth of interests represented at every level (undergrad students, grad students, faculty, etc.). This makes MIT a great place to figure out what (within math) one is interested in. I also like how, by and large, the faculty genuinely care about the quality of the teaching.</span></p>\n<p>Tristan: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My favorite part of the math department is the active community of students willing to talk about anything math. It&#8217;s always great to have peers who are excited about the same things as I am!</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>What are your least favorite things about the math department at MIT?</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan: cookies at tea time &#8211; I think I&#8217;ve eaten too many.</p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fact that there are so many strong math majors makes it very easy to fall through the cracks, which can make coursework and life difficult.</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are so many undergraduate students who are interested in math, which is fantastic! Unfortunately, many opportunities that the math department offers (UROPs, DRP, \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        SPUR)<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-20\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-20\" href=\"#annotation-20\">20</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">summer program in undergraduate research</span>\n</span>\n are resource-constrained, and the upshot of this is that they end up being available mostly to the students who came in with a lot of background, or who have very visible and measurable accomplishments to distinguish them from the crowd. This means that, while some students get fantastic opportunities and support, some get very little. I believe this dynamic also pushes some students out of considering mathematics, which is a shame.</span></p>\n<p>Misheel: MIT doesn&#8217;t have good infrastructure for grad students and undergrads to intermingle. For example, from what I have heard, Harvard students share their lounge with the grad students and they learn a ton from them. But on the other hand, the benefit at MIT is that the undergrads intermingle better. Still I think if MIT opened the grad lounge to undergrads it would be good XD</p>\n<p>Zimi: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The administration of the department seems to be a bit out of touch with the undergrads and there seems to be some d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ivide between people who did a lot of math before coming to MIT versus people who maybe did not have as much prior exposure to say, competition math, but are just here to learn math.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What is your favorite math class you have taken at MIT?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I liked a lot of them; two of them worth singling out are \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        18.783<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-21\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-21\" href=\"#annotation-21\">21</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Elliptic Curves</span>\n</span>\n and \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        18.785,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-22\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-22\" href=\"#annotation-22\">22</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Number Theory I</span>\n</span>\n which I found to be organized and taught very well. Plus, I thought the material was fascinating.</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Certainly the most influential class for me was 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Yufei Zhao. I loved the course, and, a few years on, it&#8217;s more or less defined my research interests.</span></p>\n<p>Tristan: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My favorite math class at MIT is 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Professor Yufei Zhao. I knew little about the subject before taking the class, but the course content helped me develop intuition and skills that are quite useful for both the topics covered and also math in general.</span></p>\n<p>Matthew: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It has to be 18.675, which is “Theory of Probability.” This class focuses on building a rigorous framework to understand what it actually means to define a random variable, and what it means to take the expected value of something, and finishes by talking about interesting topics such as martingales and Brownian motion. I’ve always been more interested in learning about more discrete forms of math (e.g. probability, theoretical computer science) and abstract algebra (group theory, field theory, etc.), but I think this class really made me appreciate why the fields of analysis and measure theory are important. Before I took this class, I had some vague operational notion of what probability meant (“if I flip this coin a bunch of times, I expect it to land on heads around half the time”), and this class taught me how to define probability rigorously. It also doesn’t hurt that a lot of concepts from this class showed up in my research this semester.</span></p>\n<p>Misheel: I loved \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        18.786,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-23\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-23\" href=\"#annotation-23\">23</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Number Theory II</span>\n</span>\n which was taught by my advisor, and it was \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        even heavily<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-24\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-24\" href=\"#annotation-24\">24</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Fatima: Misheel loves algebra!</span>\n</span>\n algebra-oriented than other iterations of the class.</p>\n<p>Another class I really liked is \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        18.102,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-25\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-25\" href=\"#annotation-25\">25</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Functional Analysis</span>\n</span>\n which was taught in a really fun way by Professor Melrose.

My only experience with something like this at MIT came from taking \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        18.821.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-28\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-28\" href=\"#annotation-28\">28</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Project Laboratory. one of the communication intensive offerings in the math department where you choose some different problems over the semester and work on them with your teammates. at least that is what my former advisor&#039;s edition was supposed to look like.</span>\n</span>\n My teammates were extremely friendly, accommodating, and hardworking, and we were naturally interested in different aspects of our projects so there were no conflicts :P.</span></p>\n<p>Tristan: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When working with people from different backgrounds, it&#8217;s useful to get an idea of what type of things different people work better at. For example, mathematicians in different areas might bring different techniques to the table, and some might be able to be applied to various parts of the problem.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Did you ever feel at any point that you didn’t belong in the department? Did that ever go away? Why/why not?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I experienced this freshman fall and was very intimidated by many of my classmates. For me the feeling did disappear eventually, because somehow I gradually became friends with some of those people, and found they were very friendly and willing to help me with math (and of course, they were normal people outside of math). I think I was pretty lucky, though.</span></p>\n<p>Matthew: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To some extent I have always felt this a little–I think that I really enjoy studying (some areas of) math, but at the same time I don’t feel like I really committed to taking many math classes–I enjoy taking classes from a wide range of courses (CS, biology, physics, math). I think the math department also tends to consist of a lot of students who are double-majoring in other fields because the requirements to be a Course 18 are relatively not as strict to satisfy, and I do have many friends (hi Fatima!!) who are Course 18s, so in that sense I do feel like I belong.</span></p>\n<p>Zimi: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fun fact: when I first declared my major I thought I was going to be in the \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        EECS<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-29\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-29\" href=\"#annotation-29\">29</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">electrical engineering and computer science</span>\n</span>\n department/more closely associated with EECS for some reason. So I was very surprised when I received an email addressed to “new math majors.” Before starting college I didn’t really think about studying math, so it took me a while to get used to calling myself a math major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sometimes I do feel like I don’t quite belong here. This feeling was stronger in the first two years in college—I didn’t do a lot of math in high school, so seeing people who were taking advanced classes and knew each other from high school math competitions was a bit fear-inducing. But there are a lot of other people in the department without too much background prior to coming to college. As I said before, I still wouldn’t consider myself someone who “does math,” but over time, I found myself feeling that I belong here more than I did in the beginning.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What are some skills you have found to be most useful as a mathematician?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Jonathan: This is not exactly a skill, but I&#8217;ve found it helpful to approach problems from a computational or a geometric/visualization perspective. But probably the most useful skill is figuring out how to interest other people in solving your problems!</p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Passion and interest in the material is probably the most important for me, as it makes it much easier to find motivation to work. It&#8217;s also important to be willing/able to think very carefully and thoroughly, especially when first working with proofs. I also found it helpful to be unashamed to say things like &#8220;I can&#8217;t because I have to pset.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being able to look at a problem from different perspectives. So much of research mathematics is staring at a very hard problem and having no idea how to attack it. Solutions, when they come at all, often come from unexpected sources. (I think this can be explained by conditional probability &#8212; if a problem is interesting, conditioning on it not having been solved, progress is more likely to come from an unexpected idea than a standard one.)</span></p>\n<p>Tristan: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think that being able to communicate effectively is extremely important to doing math. It&#8217;s easier to collaborate that way, to convince others of the correctness of your argument, and to teach math.</span></p>\n<p>Matthew: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think being able to struggle on problems for long periods of time without giving up even when becoming frustrated is important–often problems can take a while, and it can feel like you’re getting nowhere. This seems to be true of many difficult things though, so I think this is just generally useful at MIT.</span></p>\n<p>Misheel: Talking to people! Maybe this is specific to me, but I&#8217;m kind of bad at \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        actually doing things,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-30\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-30\" href=\"#annotation-30\">30</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Fatima: completely incorrect!</span>\n</span>\n but a lot better at coming up with random ideas (most of them useless ones). So having someone to bounce and filter ideas and essentially &#8220;storing ideas externally&#8221; makes working on problems and stuff much better and way more fun. Also talking to people is a useful skill in general and later on in life if you want to collaborate with people. I think being able to write well is a really powerful skill as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What is the most rewarding part of your job/doing math?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kind of a lame answer, but mostly just the math itself. The friends are cool too but occasionally mid.</span></p>\n<p>Carl: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Going from being utterly mystified by something to understanding it, even just a little.</span></p>\n<p>Tristan: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most rewarding part about doing math is getting to talk to other people about it. When I&#8217;m done with a cool problem or just finished learning something new, I always look forward to talking with peers about it, understanding the subject better and sharing our excitement over math.</span></p>\n<p>Misheel: The feeling of learning cool things and making cool concepts connect in cool ways. The exploring aspect. Understanding someone explain super high level math and recognizing a few words you learned recently and then using those words in a sentence where it kinda makes sense is very cool.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Anything else you would like to add!</strong></p>\n<p>Z: <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do math! math is good</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks to Paige B. &#8217;24 for helping with the questions and to everyone else for answering the questions :))!</p> https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts-on-mathmit/feed/ 0 cleats on feet, smile on face https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cleats-on-feet-smile-on-face/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cleats-on-feet-smile-on-face/#respond Emiko P.

You guessed it: I did!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since my injury in preseason this past fall, where a collision in our scrimmage against Harvard left me with a broken bone and a partially torn ligament in my right foot, it’s been a physical and emotional roller coaster. As a junior, it was a bit tough to sit on the sidelines and watch the season slowly slip through my fingers. I remember going to the trainer right after the scrimmage, thinking my foot was just a bit bruised. When they told me I should start wearing a boot, just in case, I couldn’t help but cry – I didn’t want something I had worked so hard for to be taken away by a stupid, split-second collision. Little did I know that I would get well-acquainted with that boot over the next two months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My first X-ray had great news: no broken bones! The follow-up MRI, not so much. The bone I had broken was so small that it only showed up on an MRI. Even worse, my Lisfranc, the ligament holding my foot together, was simply not intact. It was not fully torn, thank goodness. If it had been, I would’ve been looking at a surgery that would leave me unable to put weight on the foot for three months. Nevertheless, I was in a boot for two months, and I felt totally trapped. I’ve been playing soccer almost non-stop since first grade, and this has been the longest I’ve ever not played my sport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was weird to have my body struggle so much with something I did naturally my whole life. Instead of walking, I was dragging, hopping, or sliding around if I didn’t have my boot on. And even once I finally was free from the boot, I had to relearn how to walk properly. I had developed funny walking habits from wearing the boot: swinging my leg like a club-footed pirate and limping a bit because my feet were at different heights. Despite that, I finally felt like a great weight had been lifted from me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After the boot was off, it was months of physical therapy. Putting weight on the foot was a scary and mighty endeavor. The thought of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">running </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">seemed so far-fetched. The thought of smashing a ball with my foot seemed even more impossible. As my foot improved, and as the limp vanished, every step felt just a bit lighter. But I always had my eyes set on the end goal: playing soccer again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fast forward to now: the start of spring season. For the first time since August, I’m going to the locker room and lacing up my cleats – </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">me </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">lacing up the cleats, not watching everyone else do it – and it’s already a dream come true. Putting on the practice jersey, bringing my ball out to practice – all of it is so simple and routine, but suddenly it now seems so special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I’m not fully 100% yet. I’m building back to playing for long periods of time, because my foot gets pretty sore after playing a lot, so I am only allowed to play for about half a practice. I also can’t play full contact yet, which means that I can’t run into other players and can only do more technical drills like passing and dribbling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But here’s what I can do: I can run now. Not even just run, I can </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sprint</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. I lead my own line at warmup, because now is when the juniors start taking over the leadership role from the seniors. I can pass, not yet smashing them as hard as I used to, but I’m building up to it. I can play keep-away, I can juggle, I can dribble past mannequins, and I can do it all with my team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I finally feel like an athlete again, and throughout all the eight months of recovery and hardship, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is the feeling I wanted to regain the most. As the spring season continues, and as the days grow longer and warmer, I hope that my progress also continues. I hope that all the work I’ve put in will continue to pay off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Something I will always be grateful for is that, when soccer suddenly disappeared, I had an entire community to lean on. My teammates, coaches, and the athletic trainers were there for me every step of the way, asking me about my recovery progress and never letting me forget that I was still a part of the team. Thanks, guys :)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Any kind of injury – or unforeseen setback, really – is so incredibly tough. Something changes just like that, and suddenly there is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">before </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">after</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Clawing your way out of that mess, building yourself back up, is a day-in and day-out effort. It’s like melted down iron that must be reforged and rehammered into shape. Even though I am still on the road to recovery, I finally feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I have learned to treasure and love the daily things, the routine things. And I have also learned that if something is taken from me, I will do my very best to get it back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That’s all for now! I gotta go get changed for practice :)</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100171\" style=\"width: 303px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100171\" class=\" wp-image-100171\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf-400x533.jpg\" alt=\"Soccer players jumping in air.\" width=\"293\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf-400x533.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf-1000x1333.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-23-at-15.22.55_9923ccdf.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100171\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">cleats on feet, smile on face :D</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cleats-on-feet-smile-on-face/feed/ 0 Lessons from Loomis and Whitney https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/29-lessons-from-loomis-and-whitney/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/29-lessons-from-loomis-and-whitney/#respond Paige B.

If you&#8217;re not as interested in the math stuff, you can scroll on through to <strong>Part 2</strong> where I talk about some thoughts about life at MIT :). The math in the first part is some material I learned (and still love) from the UROP I did the summer after my first year at MIT.</p>\n<h4><strong>Part 1: The Loomis-Whitney inequality (aka the math part)</strong></h4>\n<p>Take your favorite set of finitely many points out in the plane, i.e. in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let&#8217;s call this set $A$. Now, suppose we look at the &#8220;shadow&#8221; of $A$ on the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, and let&#8217;s call these sets $\\pi_x(A)$ and $\\pi_y(A)$ respectively. If it helps you to see it written down mathematically, we have the functions $\\pi_x(x,y) = x$ and $\\pi_y(x,y) = y$. See the below diagram for further clarity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100162\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100162\" class=\" wp-image-100162\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-400x298.jpg\" alt=\"a point (x,y) and its projections onto the x an y axis.\" width=\"400\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-400x298.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-1000x746.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-800x596.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1.jpg 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Projections of the point (x,y).</p></div>\n<p>One question we can ask is the following: If we only know about the <em>size</em> (i.e. how many) points there are in the shadows of $A$, can we get a good bound on $A$ itself? The answer, in 2-dimensions, is quite immediate: Yes. For every point in $\\pi_x(A)$, we can draw the corresponding <em>line</em> that maps to this point under the projection, called the fibers of this projection. Similarly, we can draw every fiber corresponding to $\\pi_y(A)$, and we will notice that the set $A$ <em>must</em> lie at the intersection of the fibers from the $x$-axis and the fibers from the $y$-axis (depicted below).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100163\" style=\"width: 481px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100163\" class=\" wp-image-100163\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-400x288.jpg\" alt=\"the set A must be contained in its fibers of the projections onto the x and y axes.\" width=\"471\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-400x288.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-1000x721.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-800x576.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-1536x1107.jpg 1536w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2-1400x1009.jpg 1400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig2.jpg 1768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The set A here (in green) is contained in the fibers of its projections onto the x and y axes.</p></div>\n<p>To write this down mathematically, what we have proven is that \\[A \\subset [\\pi_x^{-1}(\\pi_x(A)) \\cap \\pi_y^{-1}(\\pi_y(A))],\\] and as such, we have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_x(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_y(A)|.\\] Or, if you prefer more directly, we have \\[A \\subset \\pi_x(A) \\times \\pi_y(A),\\] (though this won&#8217;t generalize in higher dimensions&#8211; at least not what I am going to present in higher dimensions). I.e., the number of points in $A$ is bounded by the number of points in the projection onto the $x$-axis times the number of points in the projection onto the $y$-axis.</p>\n<p>Okay, but how good <em>is</em> this bound? To understand how good this bound is, we can first consider <em>dimensional analysis</em>&#8212; a technique that is taught early on in 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) at MIT. The idea is the following: Suppose that we measured &#8220;volume&#8221; in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in square inches, i.e. $(\\text{inches})^2$. If this were the case, then the shadows of $A$ onto the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis must be measured in inches. Therefore, looking at the above inequality (and replacing $A$ with its units and $\\pi_x(A)$/$\\pi_y(A)$ it their units), we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^2) \\leq (\\text{inches})\\cdot (\\text{inches}).\\]</p>\n<p>Given that we have inches squared on both sides, we might suspect that our inequality here is <em>very</em> good (for arbitrary finite sets in $\\mathbb{R}^2$), and in fact it is! To see just how good out bound is, all we need is <em>one</em> example of a set $A$ where the inequality is an equality, and here is that example:</p>\n<p>Take your set $A$ to be the set of integer lattice points, where each coordinate is an integer between $1$ and $N$ ($N$ here being some large number). Then, in total, we have that $|A| = N^2$ while $|\\pi_x(A)| = |\\pi_y(A)| = N$.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100164\" style=\"width: 435px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100164\" class=\" wp-image-100164\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig3-400x305.jpg\" alt=\"a square lattice example that makes the bound obtained an equality.\" width=\"425\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig3-400x305.jpg 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig3-1000x763.jpg 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig3-800x611.jpg 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig3.jpg 1309w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A good example to keep in mind that shows that the inequality we proved is in fact (sometimes) an equality). Can you find another such set that leads to an equality?</p></div>\n<p>Hence, we have found a set where the inquality is an equality, and thus out bound is as good as one could&#8217;ve hoped for.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Exercise: </strong></em>Find an example of a set with roughly (up to some constant) $N$ points, whose projection onto the $x$- and $y$-axes has precisely $N$ points each. I.e., find an example of a set where the bound we got is really really bad.</p>\n<p>Okay cool&#8211; that was a lot of math (and it is about to be quite a bit more in just a second), but let&#8217;s take a breath. What did we <em>do</em>? Well, essentially, we bounded the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">area</span> of a set by the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lengths</span> of its shadows. And though this proof was fairly short, we might expect that the same thing holds in higher dimensions, which is in fact the case. In this post, the most we will do is study this in 3-dimensions, which we do now. <strong>The proof will be a little bit lengthy, but that is kinda the point of this blogpost (see Part 2).</strong></p>\n<p>Let $A$ be a finite set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. a bunch of points out in 3-dimensional space. Our goal is to (again) bound the number of points in $A$, i.e. $|A|$, by the number of points in its projections (i.e. projections onto the $xy$-, $yz$-, and $xz$-planes). Note: we denote these projections: $\\pi_{xy}, \\pi_{yz}$, and $\\pi_{xz}$ respectively. More specifically, if it is helpful to see written down, we will have that \\begin{align*} \\pi_{xy}(x,y,z) &amp;= (x,y) \\\\ \\pi_{yz} (x,y,z) &amp;= (y,z) \\\\. \\pi_{xz}(x,y,z) &amp;= (x,z).\\end{align*}</p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n  \n<div class=\"js-carousel-mod carousel-mod carousel-mod--wysiwyg-gallery \" data-wrap-around=\"true\" data-disable-transition=\"\"

this bound should look like. Namely speaking, we may expect to have a bound of the following form: \\[|A| \\leq (|\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|)^{\\alpha}\\] for some constant $\\alpha$.</p>\n<p>Why might we expect this? Well, given our set $A$ is arbitrary, we should expect that <em>no particular</em> plane should be favored&#8211; i.e. there should be a symmetry to our bounds (as we have in the above formula). Secondly, and perhaps less rigorously&#8211; this bound <em>looks</em> the same as in the 2-dimensional case. So, for now, supposing that such a bound holds, let&#8217;s figure out what $\\alpha$ should be by dimensional analysis. We measure $A$ in cubic inches and the projections (onto the 2-dimensional planes) in square inches. As such, we get that \\[(\\text{inches}^3) \\leq [(\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)\\cdot (\\text{inches}^2)]^\\alpha.\\]</p>\n<p>Hence, to get (at least through dimensional analysis) best bound we can hope for, we may expect $\\alpha = 1/2$. In fact, this is the case:</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a finite set of points. Then, \\[|A| \\leq \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|\\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|}.\\]</p>\n<p>We will spend the rest of Part 1 proving this fact, but to do so we will need some new and better ideas. Notice that, it is in fact true that \\[A\\subset [\\pi_{xy}^{-1}(\\pi_{xy}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{yz}^{-1}(\\pi_{yz}(A)) \\cap \\pi_{xz}^{-1}(\\pi_{xz}(A))],\\] and thusly we automatically have that \\[|A| \\leq |\\pi_{xy}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{xz}(A)|,\\] but this bound is <em>worse</em> than the one we are trying to obtain (and thusly we will need better ideas).</p>\n<p>The &#8220;better&#8221; idea we will need will be to write $|A|$ as a sum. In particular, consider the function: $\\mathbf{1}_A$, which is 1 on the set $A$ and is 0 otherwise. I.e., \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) = \\begin{cases}1 &amp; (x,y,z) \\in A \\\\ 0 &amp; (x,y,z) \\notin A\\end{cases}.\\] This is known as an indicator function, and it is really helpful for our problem because we have that \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z).\\] I.e., we have written $|A|$ as a sum that we can now manipulate.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but we can similarly define indicator functions for all of the projections of $A$, namely $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}$, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}$, and $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}$. What can we do with this? Well, we can notice that for all $(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we have \\[\\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\]</p>\n<p>Why is this true? Well, if $(x,y,z)$ is a point in $A$, then by definition $(x,y) \\in \\pi_{xy}(A)$, $(y,z) \\in \\pi_{yz}(A)$, and $(x,z) \\in \\pi_{xz}(A)$, so the left hand side (LHS) of the above inequality is 1 and so is the right hand side (RHS). <em>Note: there may be points where the RHS is 1 but the LHS is 0&#8211; Why??</em> Similarly, if the RHS is zero, then one of the three terms in the product must be zero (say, $\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)$). If this is the case, then it must be the case that $(x,y,z)$ is <em>not</em> a point of $A$ for any $z$! Therefore, when the RHS is zero, the LHS <em>must</em> be zero. This concludes the proof of the above inequality. Using it, we notice that we can use this in what we have proven thus far, namely: \\[|A| = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \\leq \\sum_{x,y,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\\]</p>\n<p>At this point, I want to use something known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. There are a bajillion (or rather, <a href=\"https://rgmia.org/papers/v12e/Cauchy-Schwarzinequality.pdf\">at least 12</a>) proofs of this inequality (none of which are particularly long, but that I don&#8217;t want to write down into this blogpost). Basically, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that you can go from sums of products to products of sums (with certain exponents). In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} &amp;\\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\mathbf{1}^2_{\\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2} := I \\times II.\\end{align*}</p>\n<p>Why was this helpful? Because one can see immediately that $I = \\sqrt{|\\pi_{xy}(A)|}$! <em>Note: Here, we used that $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 =1$.</em> So now we just need to bound the term $II$, or rather $II^2$ so we don&#8217;t have to carry the squareroot around everywhere. To do so, we can expand the sum in $z$ into a double sum in $z$ and another (dummy) variable $z&#8217;$.</p>\n<p>In particular, we have that \\begin{align*} II^2 &amp;=\\sum_{x,y} \\left(\\sum_z \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{x,y}\\sum_z \\sum_{z&#8217;} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z&#8217;) \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z&#8217;). \\end{align*} Try to see why the above bound is true! Using this, we have that \\begin{align*} &amp;\\leq \\sum_{x,z}\\sum_{y,z&#8217;} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z&#8217;). \\end{align*} Again, try to see why! Rearranging these sums (now that they are independent of one another), we see that \\begin{align*} &amp;= \\sum_{x,z} \\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\\cdot \\sum_{y,z&#8217;}\\mathbf{1}_{\\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z&#8217;)  \\\\ &amp;= |\\pi_{xz}(A)| \\cdot |\\pi_{yz}(A)|.\\end{align*} Throwing back in the squareroot, we obtain the desired theorem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Exercise: </strong></em>Prove that this bound is good by considering a similar example to the 2-dimensional case. Prove that this bound *can* be bad, i.e. that there is a set in which the inequality (while true) is WAAYYY overkill (for a more technical statement, see the analogous 2-dimensional exercise).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Exercise: </strong></em>Depending on your background in calculus, try proving a continuous version of this for &#8220;nice enough&#8221; sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. I.e., can you use integration (as opposed to discrete sums) to get rid of the assumption the $A$ is finite?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Exercise: </strong></em>Try generalizing this in higher dimensions! This is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality. The next difficult case to try perhaps is bounding the volume of a 4-dimensional finite set by the area of it&#8217;s projections onto (the 6!) 2-dimensional planes (i.e. the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw-planes). If you find this interesting, consider looking into Alex Iosevich&#8217;s &#8220;A View From the Top&#8221; which is how I learned about this problem.</p>\n<h4>Part 2: The Lessons (aka the life part)</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Part 2a: okay fine I&#8217;m not done talking about math yet&#8211; but give me a sec.</strong></em></p>\n<p>For those who skipped <strong>Part 1</strong>, the tldr of the math problem I was talking about was the following: Given some blob out in space, if you know how large it&#8217;s shadow is, can you know (roughly) how large the blob is? That&#8217;s is; that&#8217;s the problem (and it leads to what is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality).</p>\n<p>I first learned this proof (of the 3-dimensional) Loomis-Whitney inequality in the summer after my freshman year when I did a reading program with my (soon to be) research advisor Larry Guth and his graduate student Yuqiu Fu. Immediately, I fell in love with the problem (even if it was already solved by Loomis and Whitney all those years ago).</p>\n<p>The reason I love this problem is two-fold. One: I love that this problem uses tools that I think are fundamentally interesting in how useful/simple they are (e.g., an inequality known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality\">Cauchy-Schwarz inequality</a>, or using indicator functions). Two, and perhaps more fundamentally: I love that I can describe this problem in a single sentence: I want to understand some blob by knowing the shadows of the blob. Bam&#8211; that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>And yet, when I look at the proof in all of it&#8217;s glory, I think to myself: <em>this proof is ugly as hell</em>. I mean sure! It works! It&#8217;s a complete proof! I can write it down completely from beginning to end. I can explain all the tiny steps that go into the overall proof. And I can admire it&#8217;s perfect and elegant use of simple inequalities. And yet. <em>And yet.</em></p>\n<p>I look at the proof and think: that was actually really hard to prove <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">algebraically</span>, especially given it was something I <em>expected</em> to be immediately clear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;</p>\n<p>People sometimes ask me how I got into the type of math that I do. And my response is always this story: In some classes, sometimes there is just something that irks me about a proof. I can write it down from start to finish. Examine all it&#8217;s details from beginning to end. And still, it feels too complicated. It seems to hard to be &#8220;the right way&#8221; to prove something. But alas it is. This is a feeling I have felt in many classes, especially at MIT.</p>\n<p>Where sometimes, I would solve a homework problem in 18.701: Algebra I, look at it, and think &#8220;this must not be the simple way to prove this problem&#8221;. And most of the time I would be right. I&#8217;d turn to a friend who understood the subject better, and they&#8217;d give me a two-line, elegant solution. And then I&#8217;d stare at the solution and think to myself: well <em>this</em> seems to be hiding something behind the scenes. Like, there&#8217;s some magic that is happening that I don&#8217;t see in their two-line proof, and this (in turn) irks me more. Because in both cases, I don&#8217;t feel satisfied.</p>\n<p>So imagine my surprise when I learn this proof in my reading course with Larry and Yuqiu, and I think to myself the same thing. But this time&#8230;. This time when I tell Larry that I think the proof <em>feels</em> too complicated for what we are proving&#8211; he says he agrees. That <em>he too</em> has thought about whether or not there is a simpler proof for this statement (and as far as I know hasn&#8217;t found one).</p>\n<p>This was one of those few moments that really got me hooked into my area of mathematics: the fact that I could ask a question that I only barely knew how to put into words, and have it be something that others have been curious about before too.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Part 2b: okay fine some actual life stuff</strong></em></p>\n<p>I got into math for education. I mean, sure, I liked the subject myself, but part of what I liked most about mathematics was figuring out how to best explain/motivate a concept for other people (and thusly for myself too). This is why I ultimately decided that I wanted to become a professor.</p>\n<p>And as a result, my freshman year I really felt this pressure in every class I took:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>I&#8217;m struggling now so that one day I can explain these concepts to my students.<br />\n</em><em>Just work through it&#8211; you need to work through it to be a professor.<br />\n</em><em>Math is hard, but you just gotta get through this.<br />\n</em><em>Get through this.<br />\n</em><em>Get through this.</em></p>\n<p>At first, education felt like my anchor point. Something to aim for and aspire to. But somewhere along the way, the anchor point became a bit difficult for me to hang onto in quite the same way. What was once &#8220;Work through this to become a good professor&#8221; became</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Work through this to get into graduate school.<br />\n</em><em>You have to prove yourself to others.<br />\n</em><em>You have to prove yourself to you.<br />\n</em><em>Struggle through this.<br />\n</em><em>Struggle through this.</em></p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve gotten into graduate school&#8211; Now that I know where I will be for the next ~6 years of my life&#8211; Now that I am nearly ready to graduate from MIT&#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;</p>\n<p>As a mathematician, I look at the proof of the Loomis-Whitney inequality and think to myself: this is beautiful. As an educator, I&#8217;m conflicted. I mean sure&#8211; I can motivate why I like the proof <em>as a mathematician</em>, but I couldn&#8217;t <em>explain the proof</em> to someone on a walk. And because (for me) mathematics has always been deeply intertwined with education, that bothers me.</p>\n<p>But what bothers me more than that, is that for the past couple of years at MIT I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve ignored <em>why</em> that bothers me. I&#8217;ve ignored the part of me that <em>wants</em> to think about how I present mathematics in a more accessible way (e.g., this blog). I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps that isn&#8217;t fully coherent.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say, I am excited to stop ignoring that irksome feeling in graduate school. Because I made it. In Fall 2025, I will be returning to MIT to pursue my PhD in mathematics.</p> https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/29-lessons-from-loomis-and-whitney/feed/ 0 eclipse chasing, undergrad edition https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/eclipse-chasing-undergrad-edition/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/eclipse-chasing-undergrad-edition/#respond Audrey C.

For totality, the difference between 99% and 100% felt far beyond between 0% and 99%.

At times, when in a place where I was under a beautiful night sky, I could focus very hard on one thing and wait for a good 10-20-30 mins and notice that it has moved through the sky. In general, Celestial Objects move/change too slow for humans to dynamically notice.

I had a solar filter placed on it and a Canon EOS Rebel T3i with an eyepiece adaptor that I borrowed (thank you Mike!) I was originally planning on using that cardboard made solar filter you can see in the photo in the left being used by Daina to look at the Sun. I got that borrowed by the Astrogazers at MIT and it is a few sizes bigger than my telescope in diameter, which ofc I was aware of. What I didn’t realize is that the fact the sizes don’t match would make it impossible for the inside of the filter+telescope system to be totally dark. So it didn’t work. Fortunately, Isaac had an extra filter that can be assembled to be placed in the lenses of a camera, and the cap of my telescope has a hole in the middle that I can open in case I want a smaller amount of light entering the telescope (for example, when looking at the Full Moon) and although Isaac’s extra filter was not big enough for the diameter of my telescope, it was bigger than the middle hole of my telescope cap. There was a concern on whether the structure that holds the secondary mirror would cause weird diffraction patterns if I use the central hole but fortunately it didn’t!</span>\n</span>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the Eclipse.

Four hours north, in fact. +1 pt. for MIT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I got in! A sign, perhaps, that I had to see it. So I made plans to tag along with a group of friends in \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        ESP<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-34\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-34\" href=\"#annotation-34\">34</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Educational Studies Program, a club I’m in that runs educational programs for middle and high schoolers</span>\n</span>\n to drive up to Vermont the day of the eclipse. We found just enough people to drive, and rented cars, and planned an itinerary, and raided Trader Joe’s for road trip snacks. There were three cars’ worth of people—for my sanity in explaining all this, let’s anthropomorphize them as Carter, Caroline, and Carina. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, at 9 pm the night before April 8, the trials began:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carina’s driver had fallen sick, and couldn’t make the trip the next morning. This was unfortunate (especially for our driver, who was now both sick and unable to see the eclipse <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62d.png\" alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />), but after some deliberation, we decided to rent out a twelve-seater van (let’s name him Vance), and Carter’s driver would drive both the passengers of both Carina and Carter to Vermont.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very early in the morning, Carter’s driver and a valiant assistant embarked on their journey to the mystical land known as “the car rental place.” There they waited in line for our van. They waited. And they waited. And they waited some more, all for the poor, singular employee on the \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        morning of the eclipse<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-35\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-35\" href=\"#annotation-35\">35</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">seriously, this poor employee <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62d.png\" alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></span>\n</span>\n to process a massive line of people impatient to set out before traffic. When the rest of our crew arrived at our designated pickup location (outside the Student Center) at 8:15 am sharp, they were still waiting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time the clock hit 9:00, we were worried, but luckily we’d found another driver! We therefore no longer </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needed Vance, but unfortunately our attempts at getting access to Caroline fell through. In the wise words of one of our intrepid explorers, \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Fiona L. ‘27,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-36\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-36\" href=\"#annotation-36\">36</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Fiona would like you to know that she is the coolest person ever, and because she’s provided me with this wonderful framing device, I wholeheartedly endorse this message</span>\n</span>\n “everything that can go wrong, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will go wrong</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” so we decided to rent yet </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> new car (Carlos) to make sure we could leave on time. In the meantime, Carter’s driver stuck it out in the original Vance line just a bit longer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they finally got to the front of the line, however, the car rental place had </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no 12-seaters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In fact, they had no cars at all for us, despite our reservation. Luckily, we were prepared—“everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” Our two drivers met to pick up Carlos, and began driving back to campus for the rest of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then CARTER GOT A FLAT TIRE. I kid you not. At 9:42 am, Carter got a flat tire, and we were basically screwed. The Carter/Carlos crew worked quickly to switch to a spare, but they had to visit a repair shop before the four hour drive to Vermont. And then the first repair shop said they couldn’t fix it, so the crew had to move to a second. {Before I sent this blog to our group, I thought this shop was the one that fixed it. I have since been informed that it was not this one. Nor was it the third shop. It was, in fact, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth shop</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that could fix the tire <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62d.png\" alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />} They did the job relatively quickly, but by the time both cars made it back to campus to pick everyone up, it was 11:15 am. We had originally planned to leave at 8:15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything that can go wrong, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will go wrong</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But wait, there’s more! Totality would arrive in Vermont around 3:30 pm. Without traffic, the shortest drive to the path (headed to St. Johnsbury, VT) would be ~3 hours without any traffic. And it being the last total solar eclipse in the continental US for the next 20 years meant </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traffic</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We weren’t sure if we could make it, but luckily traffic didn’t seem bad (except in a couple spots). We were staying on schedule. Life was looking good!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I threw up… It was in a plastic bag, thank goodness, but um… that was not a fun experience, and it also meant we had to make a pit stop that delayed us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sorry to Carlos and all his other passengers <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png\" alt=\"😬\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this setback, however, we soldiered on. And somehow, miracle of miracles, we made it into the path of totality with 15 minutes to spare. We found the first available place to park, piled out of Carlos, and looked up at the sky (with eclipse glasses, of course). The color slowly leached out of our surroundings, the air got cooler, and then the sky went dark. Totality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I won’t put my pictures here, mainly because they literally just show a blob, but it was incredible. I learned about solar eclipses back in 8th grade, and we were told about these two phenomena—Baily’s Beads, where the sun shines through dips in the moon’s uneven surface to make little dots of sunlight, and the red light of the sun’s chromosphere, which is only visible during eclipses. Here’s a 2017 photo from the European Space Agency of what this look like up close, if you’re curious:</span></p>\n<p><a title=\"ESA/M.P. Ayucar, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/igo/deed.en&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Total_eclipse_ESA382763.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Total_eclipse_ESA382763.jpg/512px-Total_eclipse_ESA382763.jpg\" alt=\"Total eclipse ESA382763\" width=\"512\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d heard about them so many times, but I never thought they’d be visible from the naked eye—only from long exposures with professional cameras. And yet, looking up, there they were! Little dots of light and a distinct reddish outline around the edge of the sun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our view of totality was very brief (about 30 seconds, because we barely made it into the path of totality), but it was fascinating nonetheless.  Even more than that, though, I really loved the reactions of everyone around us watching the eclipse together. We shared eclipse glasses in the lead-up, and you could hear the murmurs crescendo into shouts and clapping as totality fell. The shared energy of humans witnessing something exciting and otherworldly was honestly just as amazing as the eclipse itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing totality, we drove north to actually reach St. Johnsbury, and waited 35 minutes for a grocery store bathroom (bless them for having it open to the public). We started heading back to MIT around 5:00 pm, and after a couple shortcuts(?), we made it back at 10:30 pm. Not nearly as long as those who’d gone up to Newport (much further north and w/ more totality), but still quite long.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was the trip a bit of a hot mess? Comedically so. Was it worth it? Definitely. I may have fallen behind on schoolwork (carsickness kept me from doing anything en route), and almost everything that could go wrong might’ve gone wrong, but we saw the eclipse! Besides, in the words of one of my favorite bands, AJR, “A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories.” And this was one of the better ones!</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"amber\"><a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/avelez9/\">Amber &#8217;24</a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B1 planned a trip that spanned three cars, eighteen people, and an egregious number of hours inching forward through traffic. We set out at 9am — we had plans for eight, but the line in front of Budget Rental Cars was far too long. I piled into a car of seniors: Gosha, Selena, Masha (Gosha’s friend), and Claire, the only other driver, who did so far more calmly than I did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first three hours of driving went fine — or at least I think they did; I was asleep in the back seat. I took over around hour two. We kept passing speed traps. But as we neared New Hampshire, or Vermont, traffic slowed to a crawl. A literal crawl. For about three hours, it probably would have been faster to get out and walk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d planned to arrive at the path of totality around 2:30pm, one hour before the 1-3 minutes of totality. But traffic pushed that back. By 2:30, we were still 40 miles away and moving about 5 miles per hour. We discussed, and decided we’d pull over at 3:20, wherever we were. We didn’t expect to be where we wanted by totality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eclipse started at 2:30, but the light didn’t change and the traffic didn’t slow until 3. When the light shifted, people started giving up on making the path of totality and pulled off to the side. All down the highway, cars pulled to the shoulder. People poured out and climbed on the hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then the highway was empty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I floored it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We raced through a light that was grey, different enough to notice, but subtle enough that on any other day I’d attribute it to an unfamiliar alignment of New England clouds, or simply to too much caffeine, and too little sleep. I pushed faster and faster. I felt the shift of gravity as we careened around curves, and the rush as I realized that one mistake would obliterate us. A few other cars were using me as coverage for speed traps and I let them pass, gave them enough distance that the highway was empty, just us and the dotted white lines blurring past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The light faded and everyone was waiting and I was making so many decisions, my foot on the gas, hurtling onward. I thought that even if we missed the totality this was how I wanted to experience the eclipse, driving so fast on empty roads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We pulled onto a side road at 3:26 and parked in a line of eclipse-viewers. The light was grey but unmistakeably day time. We approached the car next to us and asked, “Are we in totality? And do you have extra glasses?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yes, and yes,” answered a man in his mid-twenties, with close-cut brownish hair and a patterned button-down, the quintessential Bostonian professional. He gave us extra glasses; we’d left ours in one of the other B1 cars. “I drove five hours to be right here. It better be right.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We stepped away and disappeared into our glasses. Through them, the sun barely peeked out from behind the moon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the moon moved up, and the sun was just a corona.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eclipse itself was magical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was light at first in totality, then dark, like night falling all at once. It looked like true night. It was cold, and the sun behind the moon was beautiful. I understood how one could look at this and say that they had stronger gods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was dead quiet on the highway, except for one car rushing back the way we’d come. He has no wonder, we said. The quiet enhanced the magic, as if the whole world stopped for this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then it was ending. The sun peeked out, and the dim light returned. The shadows in the crags of the rocks were so deep. For the next hour I kept looking at the landscape, trying to judge, between the adrenaline in my body and my headache and the eclipse, how real the light was, how smoky or grey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m glad I saw the eclipse. I’m glad we did. That was insane all of it.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"ali\"><a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/califynmit-edu/\">Ali &#8217;26</a></h2>\n<h3><strong>how strange it is to be anything at all</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had lots of dreams as a kid. In particular, I had a bunch of pretty outlandish ones, like getting absurdly rich by starting a company, time travel to the year 3000, live to see myself graduate high school, and also, see a total solar eclipse. The internet told me, however, that the last dream was futile: the next eclipse—well, the next eclipse in the US at least, I didn&#8217;t really think about anywhere else—was hundreds of miles away from where I grew up. So, the eclipse dream got shelved like the others, and I became a worldly, serious woman without such silly aspirations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My kid self didn&#8217;t realize that by the year 2024 I would be in college and mostly have the ability to go wherever I wanted. The other thing I didn&#8217;t know was that, by pure coincidence, my family would have moved across the country to Rochester, NY—which happens to be located within that tiny sliver of totality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, four of my friends and I crashed at my house for the weekend. We got wet on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maid of the Mist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under Niagara Falls, watched </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor Things</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in my living room (that one might&#8217;ve been a mistake), and we also got to see the rarest of astronomical events: the total solar eclipse, located at a sweet 12-minute walk from my house.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is my favorite eclipse fact: most of the eclipses that will ever happen are in the past. When the moon first formed, back when the earth was young and hot and hellish, it was three times as close as it is now. It looked about three times as big as it does today. Eclipses were probably&#8230; around nine times more frequent? Over the billions of years since, the moon has slowly come to its position today, as each year the moon moves an inch and a half away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And within the next billion years, the moon will be so small that it can no longer cover the sun at all. That will be the last eclipse; we are nearly almost there. The margin is so small now that the moon is sometimes bigger than the sun, and sometimes smaller, depending on where it is in its orbit. It is coincidence beyond coincidence that there are even eclipses at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, within the next billion years, macroscopic life on Earth will end. The sun will grow ten percent brighter; the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will decrease, killing the plants and presumably all the animals with them. Then the surface temperature will rise to over a hundred degrees, cooking everything in existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so, most life on Earth that will ever live has probably already lived. To start with, though, life too was a coincidence beyond coincidence. The complexity of even the humblest cell is tremendous. And the fact that those single cells came together to think, to realize itself, to discover itself: that seems even less believable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some think that the moon was responsible for us: that the flow and ebb, the push and pull of those early tide pools was the cradle of first life. And so maybe there is a deeper link between these two coincidences. Or maybe there isn&#8217;t; trying to predict what happened millions of years ago or what will happen millions of years from now is maybe no more than just science men&#8217;s tea-leaf reading.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those were the things I was thinking about, while we were sprawled out on the lawn, waiting for the eclipse to happen. Well, there ended up being just one more coincidence: the clouds were in perfect position to block out the sky completely during the eclipse. Our hard-won eclipse glasses were useless. We grumbled under the overcast sky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than an increasing chill, no change was visible at all until maybe five minutes before the eclipse. Then the sky seemed to grow a few shades darker every minute; nothing happened for a few seconds, I looked away, I looked back, the sky was darker again, and then suddenly the sky darkened completely, like God had finished playing with us and finally flipped his light switch. Thanks to the clouds, no sun was visible; no corona; no Baily&#8217;s beads; but the sky was a dark turquoise, the clouds glowed a vomit orange. Streetlamps turned on; dogs barked. It felt unnatural and eerie, like the earth had gotten terribly sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as soon as it happened, it was over. The sky began to pale, and soon enough, it was overcast again, as if nothing had happened. I’d taken my coat off to feel the authentic chill of the eclipse; I put it back on. And on the walk back, I told my mom that this all meant we were fated to see another eclipse in the rest of our short lives—one where the sky was clear, where not a single cloud would be in the sky, and everything worked out just the way it was meant to be.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title from In the Aeroplane Over the Sea—Neutral Milk Hotel</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facts sourced from Wikipedia</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"audrey\">Audrey &#8217;24</h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the real eclipse was the friends we made along the way </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I chased totality with friends from my living group/frat t𝜩p. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We left Boston the day before to camp out in the Green Mountains in northern Vermont. As the designated “food car,” getting everything &#8212; a lot of food, a mini grill, camping equipment, personal bags, &#8212; was a game of Tetris. Grace drove, and Winnie navigated. Ilani, Terrin, and I got to turn off our brains as the backseat crew. But, I would like to think that we pulled our weight by hugging all the stuff that couldn’t fit in the trunk. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100064\" style=\"width: 736px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100064\" class=\"size-full wp-image-100064\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/carcramped-ezgif.com-webp-to-png-converter.png\" alt=\"four people cramped in a car\" width=\"726\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/carcramped-ezgif.com-webp-to-png-converter.png 726w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/carcramped-ezgif.com-webp-to-png-converter-400x300.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">like no leg room whatsoever</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After five hours of losing feeling in my butt and being neck deep in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stuff</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which I would honestly still prefer over driving), we found a place to camp right before sunset. Grace explained that we were dispersive camping, which is when you camp outside an actual campground and therefore don’t need to pay fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A thin layer of snow blanketed the ground, twinkling slightly in the fading light of the day. It was beautiful until we realized that it made keeping dry (and by extension, not getting hypothermia) harder. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-100066\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/camp.png\" alt=\"tent in the night\" width=\"726\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/camp.png 726w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/camp-400x300.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could say that we were unprepared for dispersive camping in the snow, but one could also say that we were resourceful. Using the mini grill’s lid as a shovel, we cleared out two rectangles of snow to pitch our tents. We remembered to bring charcoal briquettes for the grill, but not lighter fluid. Winnie came in clutch with the bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol that she usually keeps in her backpack for cleaning circuit boards, which surprisingly got the grill going strong enough to grill a whole fish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By then, night had fallen. We realized in the pitch black darkness that we had two headlamps for five people. But that was enough light to see that our fish was (mostly) cooked through. We dug in.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Woah what’s the goopy stuff?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Guts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Oof it tastes good.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isn’t it wild that an ungutted fish would come with guts? It helped that Ilani thought that the fish guts had the most flavor, such that we ate pretty much every part of the fish save for the bones. Sharing a whole fish was a very familial ritual for me, as my mom would pick out the bit under the cheek as the most tender part of the fish for me to enjoy. This time, I got to be the one to pick out the cheek bit for others. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-100067\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fishhh.png\" alt=\"four people holding a grilled fish\" width=\"726\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fishhh.png 726w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fishhh-400x300.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have only been able to gaze at a night sky untouched by light pollution a few times in my life. When we turned off our headlamps, it felt as if we were enveloped by an infinite black cloak. The temperature had dropped below freezing, but I forgot about that just for a bit. The woods, the mountains, and the sky melted into one endless expanse. Once my eyes adjusted, I still could only barely make out the silhouettes of trees faintly illuminated by starlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew the Big Dipper and Orion, and then Grace pointed out the Little Dipper so I guess I now know that one too. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100068\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100068\" class=\"wp-image-100068 size-full\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stars.png\" alt=\"stars!!\" width=\"408\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stars.png 408w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stars-400x533.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">the big dipper :)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought it was a firefly at first, by the way its glow darted from one corner of the sky to another. Then I realized, it was a shooting star!! I’ve seen them once before in the White Mountains a few summers ago, and I just saw my second one in the Green Mountains. Sometimes I forget that shooting stars are real. Meteors are just like the rest of us, in a hurry to get from one place to another. I’m just glad that amongst all of the possible trajectories it could’ve taken through space, it crossed mine for a brief moment. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We woke up bright and early to stuff in another hot meal, courtesy of Winnie’s grillmaster skills, and to hit the roads for Peru, a rural town in upstate New York that happened to be in the dead center of the totality path. A t𝜩p alum’s uncle owns a farmhouse there and kindly let several groups of t𝜩p alumni come over for eclipse festivities. I loved telling people that I was chasing totality in Peru without mentioning the upstate New York part. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There should’ve been two more cars of undergrad t𝜩ps to meet up with us at Peru. But noooo, they decided that the forecasted 40% cloud cover in upstate NY was too high for them and veered off towards northern Vermont instead. (Did they not consider that they just ditched the food car??) Our car talked it over, ultimately deciding that hanging out with alumni was a big part of this trip and forging ahead with what we had planned. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100069\" style=\"width: 736px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100069\" class=\"size-full wp-image-100069\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/perufarm.png\" alt=\"farmhouse\" width=\"726\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/perufarm.png 726w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/perufarm-400x300.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100069\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Farmhouse in Peru, NY</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We frolicked in the farmland, caught the alums up with current t𝜩p matters, grilled potatoes, and accidentally burned potatoes down to charcoal. Someone had a fancy telescope setup whose resolution allowed you to see sunspots freckling the brilliant orange surface of the sun. I borrowed glasses to peer at the shrinking sliver of sun once in a while. But really I was most happy to be touching grass out in the middle of nowhere and taking in the warmth of the sun after sleeping outside in below freezing conditions…</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until it suddenly got chilly. The birds must’ve felt it too, taking flight in all directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the sun slipped behind the moon, a collective </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">woah </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fell across the group. I felt many of the same things as I did the night before gazing at the stars. But at this moment, when the sky quickly fell into a velvety shade of dark cobalt, I was also reminded of one of my favorite novel scenes: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just incredible. I can’t believe you’ve given me the sky to sleep under. But I can’t tell if it’s dawn or dusk you’ve painted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She smiled up at the ceiling. “It’s neither. It’s both. Does that unnerve you?”</span></p>\n<p><em>from Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was dusk. It was dawn. It was neither, it was both in the most beautiful of ways. We were simultaneously nothing compared to the celestial bodies that just aligned and and \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        in that moment I swear we were infinite.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-37\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-37\" href=\"#annotation-37\">37</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">from &lt;em&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower &lt;/em&gt;by Stephen Chbosky</span>\n</span>\n I’m not sure if I’ve already written about this here, but I find the insignificance of my being to be more comforting than unnerving, as it means I can create significance in whatever way I choose. I tried to think about what this eclipse meant in terms of higher beings and such, but at the end of the day, the fact that I could witness all this alongside my friends bore the most significance to me. </span></p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n  \n<div class=\"js-carousel-mod carousel-mod carousel-mod--wysiwyg-gallery \" data-wrap-around=\"true\" data-disable-transition=\"\"

'23, MEng '24 Sun, 21 Apr 2024 06:56:10 +0000 Art, Literature, Music https://mitadmissions.org/?p=99856 part 1: impact One of my strongest core beliefs is that the answer to the question &#8220;what is the meaning of life?&#8221; is not &#8220;to change the world,&#8221; at least in the way that phrase is typically meant. I think it is very easy to be sold that story, especially at MIT—to be told that [&#8230;] <h4>part 1: impact</h4>\n<p>One of my strongest core beliefs is that the answer to the question &#8220;what is the meaning of life?&#8221; is not &#8220;to change the world,&#8221; at least in the way that phrase is typically meant. I think it is very easy to be sold that story, especially at MIT—to be told that your job, <em>your mission</em>, is to solve the world&#8217;s great challenges, and that nothing else will suffice, nothing else will make your life meaningful. And, it&#8217;s admirable, in a way, to declare this the meaning of life. The world faces many, many great challenges that must be solved, and, surely, it must be our job to fix them.</p>\n<p>The problem with this framing, I think, is that it makes the &#8220;everything else&#8221; of our lives mundane and unimportant, in a way that I just don&#8217;t believe. If you think about it for a few more moments, the chance that you or any other person will ever have a major, measurable impact on the world is slim to none, but each of us must have a reason to continue living. It may not be true that life itself has a meaning—but we must all have our own meanings to keep going.</p>\n<p>And, in truth, I <em>do</em> think there is a meaning of life. I wrote three years ago, <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/trying-to-trim-the-tree-of-possible-paths/\">back in sophomore spring</a>, that for me the meaning of life, in essence, is <em>other people</em>—in the communities we make and the relationships we have, the support we receive from other people and the support we give. I think this because it is the one thing in this world which makes me feel <em>most human</em>, that we interact with one another to\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        make our lives better as a collective.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-38\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-38\" href=\"#annotation-38\">38</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">this presents a rather naïve view of human nature on the surface, but I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ultimately true. If the instinct to war and to act in our self-interest at any given turn was the dominant one, I don&#039;t think would have built cities and societies in the way that we have now. It is the one thing that gives me hope about humanity. I am sure there is probably an economic argument to be made that there are systems where self-interest &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; generate the complexities of our modern lives, but I find those models generally unconvincing because I&#039;m ultimately not sure how many of these attributes of humans can be accurately modeled.</span>\n</span>\nDeep down, I&#8217;ve believed this even since high school, where I wrote that &#8220;to be little, positive parts of other people’s stories is perhaps the best we can hope to be, as we ourselves travel through life.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>One other reason that I dislike the idea that one&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;change the world&#8221; is that it fails to present a comprehensive\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        theory of change.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-39\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-39\" href=\"#annotation-39\">39</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">thanks, Petey.</span>\n</span>\n When we say we want something to change, the natural question in my mind is always &#8220;how?&#8221; When people say, &#8220;here&#8217;s something I&#8217;m mad about and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do,&#8221; I&#8217;m always thinking, &#8220;and then what?&#8221; How do we get from a point where you <em>do something</em> to a point where the thing you want changed is actually concretely better?</p>\n<p>This has always been a pet peeve of mine, and, at this point, probably something I&#8217;m overly sensitive to, having spent a number of years in various student government positions here. People love saying &#8220;this is bad&#8221; without really having any idea about how to change it, or going to administrators without doing any kind of proactive work to build relationships and collaborate in a way that actually creates positive progress. And, although I, too, understand the cathartic effects of griping and the legitimacy of many frustrations, I can&#8217;t help but think that the ultimate focus needs to be on actions which will, ultimately, drive a specific, positive impact.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;change the world&#8221; approach, to me, feels like one of these problematic cases—a mission statement without any sort of theory of change. This may seem like a strawman argument to you, but I do genuinely think there are lots of people who view their mission in life as &#8220;changing the world&#8221; without any regard as to the &#8220;how, specifically?&#8221; It&#8217;s the same reason that people in Silicon Valley <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/you-dont-have-to-be-a-founder/\">keep trying to found new things</a> rather than improving existing ones. In contrast, the intent to keep making other people&#8217;s lives better at a micro-local level, at least to me, presents a coherent theory of change—when we do kind things, other people become more likely to pay it forward, and\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        slowly, but surely, things get better.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-40\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-40\" href=\"#annotation-40\">40</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">will a kinder world on its own solve climate change, or income inequality, or any of the other billion things facing our species? No, probably not. But, I think 1) we still have an obligation to make the world less sucky while we&#039;re still here and 2) kindness does facilitate the kind of collaborations, I think, that will need to solve these kinds of Big Problems. Again, maybe naïve, but, something I feel ultimately to be true.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>So, that&#8217;s what I think. You don&#8217;t have to change the world. If you set that as your goal, your one true mission statement, you will more likely end up sad than anything else. But, if you aim at being, on net, a positive influence on the people around you, things might just work out.</p>\n<h4>part 2: art</h4>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;m very grateful to MIT for is that it has really allowed me to explore the limits of what I can do, in ways that I never quite imagined. I&#8217;ve picked up skills I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever learn; last year, in the playwright&#8217;s note for a play I wrote called <em>Remembering Her</em>, I put:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is also a play about imagination. Inside and outside the theater, I want you to imagine boldly who you could be. For the prefrosh among us, MIT is a place where you have the opportunity to challenge yourself to do things you never thought possible. Dream big. If you’d told me four years ago that I’d be involved in student government, or conducting a pit orchestra, or writing a show for people to see, I’d have told you that you were mad. But here we are. When you find yourself stuck, imagine a different world, and then find a way to get there. You may find that it is easier than you think.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that play. I wrote it in three days as an emergency back-up for\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Next Act<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-41\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-41\" href=\"#annotation-41\">41</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">every year since 1985 (excepting the COVID years), a student group called Next Act has put on a musical in Next House during Campus Preview Weekend, meant to &lt;del&gt;inculcate&lt;/del&gt; help encourage the prefrosh to come to MIT!.</span>\n</span>\n2023, for reasons that I don&#8217;t really want to get into right now. I honestly don&#8217;t really remember how I wrote it—I just know I spent a lot of time at my laptop, basically talking to myself, imagining these characters talking to each other, until suddenly there were fifty pages of script in front of me, ready to be rehearsed and revised as necessary.</p>\n<p>I really struggled during the rehearsal process for the show. I was constantly anxious, between the feeling of having my words read back to me and just the knowledge that I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time, if any, to revise anything that felt off. Every once in a while, I would begin to feel hopeful, like the play just might work, only to have it come crashing back down on me a couple of days later—up and down and up and down. I wanted to get off the train.</p>\n<p>\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Tech week<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-42\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-42\" href=\"#annotation-42\">42</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">the week before a show goes up, when all the &lt;em&gt;technical elements&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., sets and props and costumes and lights and orchestra and Everything<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, come together.</span>\n</span>\nand shows were like a fever dream. Suddenly, we had a stage and lights and chairs and\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        a steering wheel<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-43\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-43\" href=\"#annotation-43\">43</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">in the play, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/telling-the-tale/&quot;&gt;Paolo played a teenager named Kevin&lt;/a&gt;, who drives a Prius. The Prius is incredibly important, because it is, in fact, eco-friendly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; compact. Shyeah.</span>\n</span>\nand a pit, and then an audience, and then suddenly it was all over. And, even during shows, my rollercoaster of emotions continued. Every audience was different, responding to different parts of the story night to night; they clapped for\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        different scenes,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-44\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-44\" href=\"#annotation-44\">44</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">one of the parts of Next Act I&#039;m proudest of—both for myself and for the actors—is when people applauded scenes that were purely dialogue; i.e., without music or singing. On the other hand, this happened most consistently after the absolutely dumbest comedic scene that has no relation to the rest of the plot, which was a bit humbling (but well-deserved for those actors), but it did happen with a couple other plot-related scenes which I am still quite happy about.</span>\n</span>\nlaughed and &#8220;aw&#8221;ed at different moment. One day, I&#8217;d talk to a friend in more depth about the things I cared about the most in the story, the depiction of two different kinds of families or the mix between comedy and drama, and I&#8217;d feel happy about achieving my goals; the next day, I&#8217;d wake up and feel listless and hopeless again. After the second show, I wrote in my journal:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am gaining confidence that the script is a good one, but I am increasingly faced with the fact that it is a musical that is not really a musical, and a play that is not really a play, and, apart from this brief moment in which it is producible, I am not sure exactly what value it brings—</p></blockquote>\n<p>And, there it is, that funny word. <em>Value</em>. I think the fundamental question, the question which I still haven&#8217;t really resolved, is &#8220;was it good enough?&#8221; It&#8217;s the reason I haven&#8217;t written about the show until now, a whole year later. <em>I don&#8217;t know if it was good enough</em>. Sure, it was well-received, certainly by my friends, and in general, by the audiences that saw it, but it also received so much additional effort above the text. The show had great actors, great lighting designers, great directors, great musicians; it was not my work on stage, but my work modulated and focused by the people around me.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When I&#8217;m on this train of thought, I often think about\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Elizabeth Bishop&#8217;s<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-45\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-45\" href=\"#annotation-45\">45</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">a poet who wrote &quot;One Art&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/one-art/&quot;&gt;which I parodied a long time ago&lt;/a&gt;.

In describing the comparative prevalence of students interested in writing courses, rather than English or literature courses, she once said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thought is there: maybe I&#8217;m not good enough. Maybe I haven&#8217;t read enough of the classics, or even the moderns; maybe I don&#8217;t yet know or enough to produce great art, or maybe I&#8217;m just not built to produce it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found it very hard to write these past few months. I feel like nothing I write will ever really be good enough; it will never have true, artistic merit, or, at the very least, it will not have the <em>impact</em> I want it to have on readers. I want my words to be able to reach out from the page, grab the reader, and spin them around until they see the world my way, at least for a moment, to make them truly, deeply <em>feel something</em>. I want my writing to have <em>meaning</em>, for it to be edifying, to make people feel like they&#8217;ve gotten something out of each and every sentence. But, language is imprecise, and I don&#8217;t know if I will ever achieve that in the way I truly, deeply want to.</p>\n<p>I can feel this question—“was it good enough?&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s the point?&#8221;—starting to creep outwards into my life. There are places where the point is clear, or, at the very least, it seems plausible that the things I&#8217;m doing have positive societal value. I still love teaching; I still love working on computer systems, however nerdy that pursuit is. It is really in the art where the questions sit at the forefront of my mind. Why conduct? Why sing? <em>Why write?</em> I don&#8217;t have any answers beyond this primal desire to do so, this feeling that when I&#8217;m conducting or when I&#8217;m writing, I&#8217;m losing myself in the music and the text, but, the question recurs: why do <em>art</em> when I might not ever be good enough to do it professionally, when I might not ever be able to do anything world-changing?</p>\n<h4>part 3: reconciliation</h4>\n<p>It is very hard to reconcile these two worlds of thoughts—this feeling that the idea of <em>impact</em> is overrated, and this overwhelming feeling that the art I make must have <em>artistic value</em>. Everything about art feels so fleeting and vulnerable that the importance of impact is magnified; after all, the relationship between a person and your art is always transitory. The moment of interaction is always brief, fleeting, and uncertain; a show happens, a poem is written and read, and then it is on to the next thing. How can I make something that lasts or that matters within that context?</p>\n<p>In this sense, one of the only things that grounds me is, strangely enough, external validation.</p>\n<p>I often feel uncertain about my relationship with external validation. It seems that for one&#8217;s happiness to be truly, deeply\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        complete,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-46\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-46\" href=\"#annotation-46\">46</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">and there we are, back to the Aristotle.</span>\n</span>\nit must be lasting, and external validation is anything but. Yet, it is the thing that most often reminds me that I am achieving my goals, in whatever little ways I can. It reminds me that my art is <em>doing the thing</em>, that when people respond to my work, when they say they &#8220;feel seen,&#8221; it is becoming a small, positive part of someone else&#8217;s life, and that I <em>can</em> release it into the wild.</p>\n<p>In other words, it provides me a theory of change.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve often thought of writing as this kind of deeply lonely task. You sit at your desk, or, in my case, on my bed or on a couch, somewhere, and you type away until you either have a product or you give up. Your writing is founded on observation, sure, but that observation process, I think, is also more often conducted alone, in the solitary moments you have, passing through the world rather than living fully in it. I feel this way about music, too, sometimes. You practice and you learn your music on your own, and then you show up at rehearsal just to put it all together, and, yes, there&#8217;s a back and forth, but, ultimately, the <em>practice </em>of it, the <em>individualness</em> of it, feels solitary.</p>\n<p>You might say, and you would be right, that the writing is just one part of the story. A theatre production—especially one like Next Act,\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        where the whole goal of the project is accepting everyone<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-47\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-47\" href=\"#annotation-47\">47</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">as in, we literally cast everyone who auditions for a show, and we teach them to act, sing, and dance, no matter their skill level.</span>\n</span>\nand building community—involves so many people working together in ways that are hard to express, and that, too, is an opportunity to make other people&#8217;s lives better, to be a kind collaborator and to work together to make something beautiful. And, similarly, I <em>am grateful</em> for all the feedback I&#8217;ve gotten over the years, in poetry workshops and orchestra rehearsals, and for all the work people have invested in things <em>for me</em>, from pit musicians to\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        first readers<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-48\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-48\" href=\"#annotation-48\">48</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">almost everything I&#039;ve written for the blogs, for instance, goes through a first read, usually from Paolo, Shuli, or CJ. this post was read by my roommate, Krit!</span>\n</span>\nto actors to everyone else in between, which has made my life and my work better in countless ways.</p>\n<p>But, in the moment, when you are working away on a project on your own, it is very easy to forget. It is easy to feel like the audience is the void. That nothing is ever going to respond to your work, to these collections of glyphs on a screen or to the music you are making. And when the audience is the void, it is easy to forget why you should be making art in the first place.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Since childhood, I&#8217;ve been a big fan of <a href=\"https://alanzhublog.blogspot.com/2020/07/maps-brochures-programs-and-other.html\">keeping memorabilia</a>. I have so many different objects, from brochures to maps to countless programs from all the shows and concerts I&#8217;ve seen or been involved in. I&#8217;d like to think I have a pretty good memory, but the concrete objects <em>remind</em><em> </em>me of the things I&#8217;ve done and the places I&#8217;ve been in a way that feels more visceral and important.</p>\n<p>One of my special collections lives outside of my\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        memorabilia crate,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-49\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-49\" href=\"#annotation-49\">49</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">and, yes, it is a crate.</span>\n</span>\nresiding instead in the top-most drawer in my desk. It&#8217;s a collection of every hand-written thank you note and birthday card and everything else I&#8217;ve ever received. Whenever I get a kind email, a note, I file it away for moments where I feel like I am treading water in the void. I read them to remind me that my art and my life have a purpose, and that, as I work, I am still making steps towards achieving it. That the little actions we take each day to make each other&#8217;s lives better <em>do matter</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>And so it is these kinds of moments which kept me going through and after Next Act. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hold-me-but-not-too-close/\">written before</a> that I believe one of the highest compliments that an artist can receive is “this made me cry”; when the things we make can evoke an emotion strong enough in someone else to make them cry. After the first performance, my\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        Head of House,<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-50\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-50\" href=\"#annotation-50\">50</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">at MIT, there is usually a faculty member who lives in the house and helps manage the team of Graduate Residential Assistants and generally serves as a positive influence to the house. Our HoH is Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, who does &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2020/twists-magic-angle-graphene-map-0508&quot;&gt;some pretty cool stuff with &quot;magic angle&quot; graphene&lt;/a&gt;.</span>\n</span>\nwho&#8217;d been a part of my time at Next House all four years, told me that it made him cry. Another friend told me it was the first time he&#8217;d seen a non-conventional family represented so movingly on stage. It worked. I had added something positive to their lives, however small and transitory.</p>\n<p>Even still, you forget. It&#8217;s so hard to remember the joy and the purpose of making art—every time I put down the pen, it takes me so much more energy to pick it back up again, because I just worry and worry and worry, that it won&#8217;t be <em>good enough</em>, rather than thinking about the small, positive differences I could make. I&#8217;ve been working on a play again this semester, and it is has been so much harder to write than anything I&#8217;ve written before. The expectations and the stakes feel higher, in a way that makes it hard to keep making forward progress, rather than just throwing one&#8217;s arms up and giving up.</p>\n<p>I came back to Next Act this year, this time in a much smaller role: I helped vocal direct and then played\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        percussion<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-51\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-51\" href=\"#annotation-51\">51</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">I kinda got drafted into doing this, but, honestly, I didn&#039;t know how much of a joy it would be to just sit around and make noises—I had a glockenspiel, a xylophone, a slapstick, a shaker, some sleigh bells, and a keyboard with which I could make a library of other noises. Truly lovely. On the other hand, I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; not used to counting rests.</span>\n</span>\nin the pit orchestra. The show was <em>Legally Blonde</em>, which is one of my favorite musicals, and our conductor was one of my good friends, who lives on\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        4W<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-52\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-52\" href=\"#annotation-52\">52</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">a living community in Next House, where I lived during my four years of undergrad.</span>\n</span>\nand played in the pit for <em>Heathers</em>, my very first conducting gig, just over a year ago. I enjoyed feeling like I was serving a purpose—imparting the wisdom which I&#8217;ve sopped up from years of choir in the first role, and then just making a bunch of noises\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        at the right time<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-53\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-53\" href=\"#annotation-53\">53</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">well, most of the time.</span>\n</span>\nin the second one.</p>\n<p>At the second show, during intermission, somebody came up to me and thanked me for <em>Remembering Her</em>. They said that it&#8217;d helped them cope with their friend&#8217;s passing a month before.</p>\n<p>And I remembered again. I remembered why it all matters so much.</p>\n<h4>part 4: be kind</h4>\n<p>Really, that&#8217;s all there is, at the end of the day. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. Use your life to be a little, positive part of someone else&#8217;s story. And, hey, maybe along the way you&#8217;ll solve one of the world&#8217;s great challenges; maybe you&#8217;ll find a job you really love, or a passion that keeps you going, or both, or neither. But, in any case, you&#8217;ll have done something that mattered.</p>\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;re not the kind of person who needs a drawerful of notes and anecdotes to remind you that, occasionally, the things you do in the world help other people, that they matter. Maybe you&#8217;re not even convinced that these things matter at all in the long run, and we must agree to disagree on the premise entirely. Even still, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s someone in your life who might believe these things, who might need those notes to keep going. So, you know, check in on them. Say &#8220;thank you.&#8221; Because, at the end of the day, who are we except for the people who made us, us?</p>\n<p>I want to leave you with a monologue from the play, which is kind of about all of this and is kind of about the passage of time, but is certainly something I believe. It is one of the only pieces of my writing I stand by without a hint of reservation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">RACHEL: I guess, when we lost your dad&#8230; I didn’t know what we were gonna do. And I was so afraid that we would forget him. And, in some ways, we have. People we love will always be entering and leaving our lives. We’ll never be able to remember every moment precisely, every laugh and smile, every kiss and every disagreement. These things fade, and that’s okay.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">KEVIN: But what if I don’t want to forget?</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">RACHEL: Memories fade, but their impacts don’t. You know how people say “you are the company you keep”? That’s what they mean. The people you spend time with change you, and if you remember that, and you honor the ways they changed you, well—maybe that’s the best way we can remember them.</p>\n</blockquote> https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/whats-the-point/feed/ 0 MIT Admissions Math Month, Part 1 – Duality https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-admissions-math-month-part-1-duality/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-admissions-math-month-part-1-duality/#respond Andi Q.

MIT exposes us to so many beautiful mathematical concepts, so Paige and Fatima have challenged us bloggers to write posts about these concepts this month. To kick off this challenge, let me tell you about </span><b>duality</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – a neat little concept that shows up everywhere, from algorithms to superconducting circuits.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is duality?</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a non-mathematician, I think it’s hard to define duality succinctly yet intuitively. I usually just kind of wave my hands and say, “Uhh, it’s like when two things are different, but they’re actually the same.” So instead of attempting to define it, here’s a concrete example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you draw two points on a sheet of paper.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-100018 size-medium\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.56 PM-400x286.png\" alt=\"Two points in the plane\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.56 PM-400x286.png 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.56 PM.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to connect those two points using a straight line, there’s only one way to do it. So we say that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two points define a line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-100019 aligncenter\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.59 PM-400x286.png\" alt=\"Line connecting two points\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.59 PM-400x286.png 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.59 PM.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now suppose you draw two lines on a sheet of paper (but make the lines infinitely long).</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-100020 size-medium\" src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.16.05 PM-400x286.png\" alt=\"Two lines in the plane\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.16.05 PM-400x286.png 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.16.05 PM.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming these lines are not parallel, they intersect each other exactly once.

Specifically, I use duality to analyze electrical circuits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In physics, electric fields (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)) and magnetic fields (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) are duals. For every equation involving \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), there’s an equivalent equation involving \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and vice versa.

Freshman year, I made the unfortunate decision to attend the 9 am option for my physics lectures – which was admittedly a bit optimistic on my part. The mornings I had physics, I would wake up at 8:50 am and frantically dash from my dorm to class. Nothing will ever feel as far as that walk \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        from New Vassar to the physics building.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-57\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-57\" href=\"#annotation-57\">57</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Looking it up now, that’s only 0.3 miles… BUT STILL</span>\n</span>\n </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That was my first taste of trekking around campus. MIT’s campus is a whopping 168 acres – which is 1.5x bigger than Vatican City! To get from one end of campus to another, such as from Tang Hall to the Sloan School of Management, it would be a \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        1.2 mile walk.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-58\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-58\" href=\"#annotation-58\">58</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Which is about the length of 12,672 standard sized hotdogs, if you’re curious.</span>\n</span>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This may seem a bit daunting, but don’t worry! There is a solution: the almighty MIT time. MIT time is a rule that applies to \n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        every single class at MIT<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-59\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-59\" href=\"#annotation-59\">59</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">at least for undergrads</span>\n</span>\n that states that class starts 5 minutes later and ends 5 minutes earlier than its scheduled time. While MIT time helps, it’s not quite enough, so all of us have had to come up with some ways of getting around campus a bit faster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That brings us to our topic today! There are many different modes of transportation around campus, and each has its own pros and cons and silly stereotypes. So here’s what your chosen mode of transportation says about you.</span></p>\n<h3>1. Bikes</h3>\n<p>You are down-to-earth. You are very diligent, and everyone wants to be your partner in a group project. You probably like to hike or do something outdoors-y. You’re a pro at avoiding <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<span class=\"annotation-mod js-annotation\">\n  <span class=\"annotation-link js-annotation-trigger\">\n          <span class=\"annotation__text\">\n        the most dangerous thing on planet Earth.<span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">&#8288;<a id=\"annotation-trigger-60\" class=\"annotation__number\" aria-describedby=\"annotation-60\" href=\"#annotation-60\">60</a></span>\n      </span>\n      </span>\n  <span class=\"annotation\">Boston drivers</span>\n</span>\n</span> A car has definitely almost hit you while turning off the bridge, and ever since then you’ve been wearing a helmet. You properly lock up your bike in the rack, although you sometimes forget where you locked it up and for a split second you think someone stole it. You do not cause issues, and everyone should try to be more like you.</p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n  \n<div class=\"js-carousel-mod carousel-mod carousel-mod--wysiwyg-gallery \" data-wrap-around=\"true\" data-disable-transition=\"\" data-adaptive-height=\"false\" data-lazy-load=\"2\" data-max-width=\"false\">\n  <div class=\"js-carousel\" id=\"carousel_\">\n        \n                <div class=\"js-slide wysiwyg-gallery__slide\">\n        <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__img-mod\">\n          <img data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240419-WA0006-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"Biker smiling with their bike.\">\n                      <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__slide-caption\">Safety first!</div>\n                  </div>\n      </div>\n                  <div class=\"js-slide wysiwyg-gallery__slide\">\n        <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__img-mod\">\n          <img data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-19-at-21.02.24_733e86c8-800x590.jpg\" alt=\"Girl riding a pink bike.\">\n                      <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__slide-caption\">Lowkey this bike is so drippy.</div>\n                  </div>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"carousel-nav carousel-nav--wysiwyg-gallery\" aria-controls=\"carousel_\">\n      <button class=\"js-carousel-prev carousel-nav__button carousel-nav__button--prev carousel-nav__button--wysiwyg-gallery\">\n        <svg width=\"32px\" height=\"9px\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 9\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" class=\"icon--arrow-right\">\n  <title>An arrow pointing right</title>\n    <defs></defs>\n    <g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\n        <g transform=\"translate(-396.000000, -1107.000000)\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n            <g transform=\"translate(173.500000, 1099.562500)\">\n                <g transform=\"translate(238.877327, 11.495980) rotate(10.000000) translate(-238.877327, -11.495980) translate(222.877327, 5.995980)\">\n                    <path d=\"M28.6919623,5.00931715 C19.7847167,7.52678157 10.7237199,9.45274432 1.56089964,10.7764289 C0.619350428,10.9123038 0.360548168,9.45660299 1.30439849,9.32053458 C10.8383422,7.94323659 20.2616477,5.9139544 29.5169985,3.24461967 C29.3928225,3.01726262 29.0565085,2.87736963 28.7052641,2.63054785 C28.2107251,2.28318507 27.7159439,1.93565271 27.2214049,1.58828993 C26.4416564,1.04049947 27.2908033,-0.169630546 28.0693408,0.377311972 C28.8578083,0.931207565 29.6812321,1.4557995 30.4437045,2.04527348 C30.9148912,2.40949146 31.2939565,2.81351745 31.2520855,3.4465273 C31.2062329,4.14605 30.6061224,4.75669793 30.2228559,5.3004509 C29.652656,6.10962587 29.0824562,6.91880083 28.5118446,7.72804841 C27.9630127,8.50670673 26.7527131,7.65780206 27.3008666,6.88011252 C27.7370761,6.26133215 28.2365225,5.64419033 28.6919623,5.00931715 Z\"></path>\n                </g>\n            </g>\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n        <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Previous</span>\n      </button>\n      <button class=\"js-carousel-next carousel-nav__button carousel-nav__button--next carousel-nav__button--wysiwyg-gallery\">\n        <svg width=\"32px\" height=\"9px\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 9\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" class=\"icon--arrow-right\">\n  <title>An arrow pointing right</title>\n    <defs></defs>\n    <g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\n        <g transform=\"translate(-396.000000, -1107.000000)\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n            <g transform=\"translate(173.500000, 1099.562500)\">\n                <g transform=\"translate(238.877327, 11.495980) rotate(10.000000) translate(-238.877327, -11.495980) translate(222.877327, 5.995980)\">\n                    <path d=\"M28.6919623,5.00931715 C19.7847167,7.52678157 10.7237199,9.45274432 1.56089964,10.7764289 C0.619350428,10.9123038 0.360548168,9.45660299 1.30439849,9.32053458 C10.8383422,7.94323659 20.2616477,5.9139544 29.5169985,3.24461967 C29.3928225,3.01726262 29.0565085,2.87736963 28.7052641,2.63054785 C28.2107251,2.28318507 27.7159439,1.93565271 27.2214049,1.58828993 C26.4416564,1.04049947 27.2908033,-0.169630546 28.0693408,0.377311972 C28.8578083,0.931207565 29.6812321,1.4557995 30.4437045,2.04527348 C30.9148912,2.40949146 31.2939565,2.81351745 31.2520855,3.4465273 C31.2062329,4.14605 30.6061224,4.75669793 30.2228559,5.3004509 C29.652656,6.10962587 29.0824562,6.91880083 28.5118446,7.72804841 C27.9630127,8.50670673 26.7527131,7.65780206 27.3008666,6.88011252 C27.7370761,6.26133215 28.2365225,5.64419033 28.6919623,5.00931715 Z\"></path>\n                </g>\n            </g>\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n        <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Next</span>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>2.

You are a bit chaotic, but you embrace it, and everyone loves you for it!</span></p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n  \n<div class=\"js-carousel-mod carousel-mod carousel-mod--wysiwyg-gallery \" data-wrap-around=\"true\" data-disable-transition=\"\" data-adaptive-height=\"false\" data-lazy-load=\"2\" data-max-width=\"false\">\n  <div class=\"js-carousel\" id=\"carousel_\">\n        \n                <div class=\"js-slide wysiwyg-gallery__slide\">\n        <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__img-mod\">\n          <img data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240419-WA0003-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"Bikes parked on road.\">\n                      <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__slide-caption\">The Blue Bike station on the Boston side of the bridge.</div>\n                  </div>\n      </div>\n                  <div class=\"js-slide wysiwyg-gallery__slide\">\n        <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__img-mod\">\n          <img data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240419-WA0005-800x1465.jpg\" alt=\"Biker posing on bike with cowboy hat.\">\n                      <div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery__slide-caption\">Blue Bike aesthetic</div>\n                  </div>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"carousel-nav carousel-nav--wysiwyg-gallery\" aria-controls=\"carousel_\">\n      <button class=\"js-carousel-prev carousel-nav__button carousel-nav__button--prev carousel-nav__button--wysiwyg-gallery\">\n        <svg width=\"32px\" height=\"9px\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 9\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" class=\"icon--arrow-right\">\n  <title>An arrow pointing right</title>\n    <defs></defs>\n    <g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\n        <g transform=\"translate(-396.000000, -1107.000000)\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n            <g transform=\"translate(173.500000, 1099.562500)\">\n                <g transform=\"translate(238.877327, 11.495980) rotate(10.000000) translate(-238.877327, -11.495980) translate(222.877327, 5.995980)\">\n                    <path d=\"M28.6919623,5.00931715 C19.7847167,7.52678157 10.7237199,9.45274432 1.56089964,10.7764289 C0.619350428,10.9123038 0.360548168,9.45660299 1.30439849,9.32053458 C10.8383422,7.94323659 20.2616477,5.9139544 29.5169985,3.24461967 C29.3928225,3.01726262 29.0565085,2.87736963 28.7052641,2.63054785 C28.2107251,2.28318507 27.7159439,1.93565271 27.2214049,1.58828993 C26.4416564,1.04049947 27.2908033,-0.169630546 28.0693408,0.377311972 C28.8578083,0.931207565 29.6812321,1.4557995 30.4437045,2.04527348 C30.9148912,2.40949146 31.2939565,2.81351745 31.2520855,3.4465273 C31.2062329,4.14605 30.6061224,4.75669793 30.2228559,5.3004509 C29.652656,6.10962587 29.0824562,6.91880083 28.5118446,7.72804841 C27.9630127,8.50670673 26.7527131,7.65780206 27.3008666,6.88011252 C27.7370761,6.26133215 28.2365225,5.64419033 28.6919623,5.00931715 Z\"></path>\n                </g>\n            </g>\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n        <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Previous</span>\n      </button>\n      <button class=\"js-carousel-next carousel-nav__button carousel-nav__button--next carousel-nav__button--wysiwyg-gallery\">\n        <svg width=\"32px\" height=\"9px\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 9\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" class=\"icon--arrow-right\">\n  <title>An arrow pointing right</title>\n    <defs></defs>\n    <g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\n        <g transform=\"translate(-396.000000, -1107.000000)\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n            <g transform=\"translate(173.500000, 1099.562500)\">\n                <g transform=\"translate(238.877327, 11.495980) rotate(10.000000) translate(-238.877327, -11.495980) translate(222.877327, 5.995980)\">\n                    <path d=\"M28.6919623,5.00931715 C19.7847167,7.52678157 10.7237199,9.45274432 1.56089964,10.7764289 C0.619350428,10.9123038 0.360548168,9.45660299 1.30439849,9.32053458 C10.8383422,7.94323659 20.2616477,5.9139544 29.5169985,3.24461967 C29.3928225,3.01726262 29.0565085,2.87736963 28.7052641,2.63054785 C28.2107251,2.28318507 27.7159439,1.93565271 27.2214049,1.58828993 C26.4416564,1.04049947 27.2908033,-0.169630546 28.0693408,0.377311972 C28.8578083,0.931207565 29.6812321,1.4557995 30.4437045,2.04527348 C30.9148912,2.40949146 31.2939565,2.81351745 31.2520855,3.4465273 C31.2062329,4.14605 30.6061224,4.75669793 30.2228559,5.3004509 C29.652656,6.10962587 29.0824562,6.91880083 28.5118446,7.72804841 C27.9630127,8.50670673 26.7527131,7.65780206 27.3008666,6.88011252 C27.7370761,6.26133215 28.2365225,5.64419033 28.6919623,5.00931715 Z\"></path>\n                </g>\n            </g>\n        </g>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n        <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Next</span>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>3. Razor Scooter</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If your transportation of choice is a Razor Scooter, you live on campus or in Cambridge – and it is very likely you are a male athlete in a fraternity. You ride the scooter in packs, with three of your fellow male athletes accompanying you on your journey. You never ride them particularly fast – in fact, you rarely scoot faster than walking pace. You usually park them in piles outside of the locker room or outside of the dining halls. You’ve come to terms with the fact that, when it rains, your pants will be perpetually wet from the wheel spray. You are nice and often let your friends use your scooter when they’re in a time crunch. They’re all a bit rusty from overuse, but your Razor scooter has been with you since freshman year, and you will continue to use it until you graduate.</span></p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n

Electric Scooter</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You are a menace, and you most likely live across the bridge in Boston. Other students find you annoying because you zip around campus, narrowly avoid pedestrians, and casually gun 20+ mph on the bridge – yet somehow you’re still always late to class. Your friends always try to convince you to let them hitch a ride on your scooter (which involves a weirdly intimate ride as you both cram onto the scooter and hang on for dear life). You either drive a literal tank (200 pounds, can go 50 mph) or something with two wheels and a slapped-on motor that they then called an electric scooter. You are on your second scooter because the first one was stolen! Because you’ve ridden it so much and because Boston streets aren’t exactly smooth, your scooter is in disrepair, and you should probably go get that fixed instead of \n<span class=\"annotation-mod

Skateboards</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You are cool and a bit of an enigma. You like to skateboard over the Charles River – and with the wind whipping your hair and the sun rising over the river, you are definitely giving off main character energy. You are an academic weapon, you always help people out with PSETs, and you do it all while maintaining this certain level of chill-ness. You have unbreakable confidence, and your ability to gracefully roll over cracks and not face plant is awe inspiring. Also, you definitely either ski or snowboard.</span></p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-gallery\">\n\n  \n<div class=\"js-carousel-mod carousel-mod carousel-mod--wysiwyg-gallery \" data-wrap-around=\"true\"

MIT Shuttle</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MIT has a couple of shuttle systems: some that take you from your off-campus housing in Boston to campus, some that are inter-campus, and some that take you to places like Trader Joes. If this is your mode of transportation, you are just trying to go about your daily life. You probably have submitted at least a dozen complaints about the inconsistency of the shuttles, but you are still loyal to them because you refuse to get a scooter. Your entire schedule revolves around the shuttle and when it will pick you up. You spend a lot of time at the Stud, your daily workout comes from sprinting to make the shuttle in time, and you like to hang out with others while you do homework. You like seeing your friends on it in the mornings, and when it gets cold and snowy out, riding the shuttle home with the squad always makes you feel cozy.</span></p>\n<div

We hiked in the snow during the eclipse leading up to totality, squinting up at the sun getting eaten by the moon like a cookie through eclipse glasses and the Celestron 12x50mm solar binoculars I'd bought for the occasion (one of the very last two from Walmart online, the other of which went to my dad for his birthday). Robert and Cory had rescued a guy whose car got stuck in the snow-mud, and he and his dog Radar hiked with us until they got to their eclipse-watching spot. When we got back to the car, another guy's car was stuck in the snow-mud, but he was embarrassed and didn't want help. We watched the rest of the lead-up from the car, and then, when it started getting dark, from outside. It got dark, and grey, but not like at sunset, and sharp shadows came out, not at all like the soft shadows at sunset. It got cold. I put on my sweater (it had been t-shirt weather all day) and then my jacket over it. We could see planets shining in the sky. Everyone was quiet; even the sound of traffic was gone. Dogs barked. The actual event was extraordinary. It was like everyone here describes it, and it looked just like the photos in this blog post.
