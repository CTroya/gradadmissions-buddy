I usually just kind of wave my hands and say, “Uhh, it’s like when two things are different, but they’re actually the same.” So instead of attempting to define it, here’s a concrete example. Suppose you draw two points on a sheet of paper. If you want to connect those two points using a straight line, there’s only one way to do it. So we say that two points define a line .

I usually just kind of wave my hands and say, “Uhh, it’s like when two things are different, but they’re actually the same.” So instead of attempting to define it, here’s a concrete example. Suppose you draw two points on a sheet of paper. If you want to connect those two points using a straight line, there’s only one way to do it. So we say that two points define a line .
