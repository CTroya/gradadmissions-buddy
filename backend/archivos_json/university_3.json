Hosted by the Executive Director of the Graduate School’s Careers Beyond Academia, Susi Varvayanis, and featuring in-person the author, Donna Peters MBA ’99.

The goal of this is for readers to learn how to confront anxiety head-on and step into the face of threat. (2016, Health Communications Inc.)

In “ Atlas of the Heart,” some eighty-seven emotions and experiences define what it means to be human and what is needed to cultivate meaningful connections. For the discussion, we will review “places we go when things are uncertain or too much” where we go when we are stressed, overwhelmed, anxious, worried, avoid, excited, dread, fear, and vulnerable. In addition, we will review “places we go when things don’t go as planned,” which includes, boredom, disappointment, expectations, regret, discouragement, resignation, and frustration. Finally, we will talk about “places we go when we search for connection,” including, belonging, fitting in, connection, disconnection, insecurity, invisibility, and loneliness. If these places sound familiar to you, come and join us for an open and honest conversation with Dr. Brown’s wisdom.

We’ll also look at the amazing historical images taken by the photographer, Frank Hurley, that were part of an American Museum of Natural History’s exhibition. Come be inspired!

Families Make Your Family a Part of the Cornell Family Looking for information? Please go to our Students with Families website and visit us on our Facebook page . The Cornell University Graduate School recognizes the importance of family in supporting a healthy student life experience and that families are essential allies in encouraging the academic success and well-being of our students. As a result, we provide resources and services to assist spouses and partners with their own ambitions and goals, along with essential support for families with child(ren). We operationalized this through the creation of the campus-wide Students with Families Advisory Committee, which brings together staff, faculty, and students from different units. The goal of this committee is to approach student families holistically, determine priorities, and develop new partnerships to enhance programming efforts. This group provides direction and makes university recommendations to what additional needs our families have. In addition, this committee helps with communication so that key offices are informed of resources available to partners and students with children to help with dissemination of information. Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life, is the chair of this committee. Our main project as a committee was to create a website that included information, policies, and resources for our expectant students, students with children, and student partners and spouses. We encourage you to visit this website for more information about resources and services Cornell has to support you and your family. To complement the efforts of the university website, we also sponsor a Facebook site with the following goals: 1) increase community and connection among our students with families population, 2) serve as an effective method of communication to the students with families population directly, and 3) more easily identify our students with families. We encourage you to like us on Facebook . As always, the Graduate School is interested in your experience. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Janna Lamey ( janna.lamey@cornell.edu ).

Series Weekly Walks Book Clubs Student Governance Student Perks and Discounts Graduate School Student Experience Student Life Programs Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series Graduate School Primer: Navigating Academia Workshop Series As part of a continued orientation experience for incoming graduate and professional students, the Graduate School sponsors a special seminar series for first-year graduate and professional students. The purpose of Graduate School Primer workshops is for students to gain valuable information and skills to make a successful transition into the role of a Cornell graduate or professional student. Workshops will take place virtually mid-July through August 2024.  Session dates and times will be announced in June. 2024 Workshops Understanding and Overcoming the Imposter Experience Presenter: Jessamyn Perlus, senior associate director, Cornell Career Services Did you know that impostor feelings are normal and that most high-achieving graduate students experience these feelings at some point? Join us to better understand the impostor phenomenon; learn to recognize it and see recent research on how it can be a barrier to graduate student success. By defining it and sharing experiences, you’ll learn evidence-based tools to help combat impostor feelings. Getting the Mentoring You Need and Want Presenters: Colleen McLinn, Ph.D., associate dean for professional development, and Sara Xayarath Hernández, associate dean for inclusion and student and faculty engagement In this workshop, graduate students reflect on their mentoring experiences and needs, learn to co-construct and manage mutual expectations within their mentoring relationships, and develop strategies to establish a network of mentors to get the mentoring they need and want across multiple domains. This workshop also introduces the FAIM (Faculty Advancing Inclusive Mentoring) Resource Center , which provides a framework to support the development and advancement of inclusive and equity-minded mentoring practices within graduate and postdoctoral education. The FAIM framework is comprised of an inclusive mentoring philosophy, key principles, and practical tools and resources intended to be adapted and adopted to meet the contextual needs of mentors and mentees. Understanding Doctoral Funding at Cornell Presenter: Jason Kahabka, associate dean for administration At Cornell, almost all Ph.D. students receive funding that pays tuition and provides a living stipend through a combination of fellowships, assistantships, and external scholarships. This presentation will explain how stipends are paid, what your responsibilities are, and provides insight on how to be an active participant in your own funding plan. Maximize Your Every Minute Presenter: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life While there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to best manage your most precious resource (TIME), time management is a skill that can be learned! Given the many demands for your time and attention to support your many identities, roles, and relationships, techniques can be learned to help you be able to intentionally decide what you should do when. Join us for an interactive discussion that reviews commonly used techniques, how to make strategic decisions that support the whole you, and how to maintain relationships when setting boundaries. In addition, share with others what you have found works best for you. The Basics of Mental Health and Well-Being Presenter: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life Make sure that you develop your mental health support plan so that you can have the energy and reserves to support your academic success. The stressors of being a graduate student are real and understanding the research for how you can best support your mental health and well-being is key to your future success. In this session, we will define mental health, learn key concepts of resilience, and emphasize the importance of sense of belonging and self-care practices. You’ll be able to connect with others in the session. University and local resources are also provided. Creating, Building, and Maintaining Social Networks Presenters: Janna Lamey, senior assistant dean for graduate student life; and panel of esteemed students Relationships that are grounded in trust, respect, and acceptance are the strongest factor in building and maintaining resilience. And, starting a new program at a new place can be challenging to create, build, and maintain social networks.  So, what is a graduate student supposed to do? During this one-hour session, we’ll review the value of social networks, and more importantly, hear from graduate and professional students who have strategies and suggestions for how to build your social network right from the beginning. Developing as an Instructor Presenters: Colleen McLinn, Ph.D., associate dean for professional development, and Derina Samuel, Ph.D., associate director, graduate student development, Center for Teaching Innovation Will you have teaching responsibilities this fall? Are you thinking about a faculty career track and want to develop your skills as an instructor? If your answer is “yes”, or you just want to find out more about teaching, join us to explore the many resources that are available to you at Cornell. At this session we will discuss the various teaching roles graduate students experience and identify areas you could develop to ensure a successful teaching experience. Navigating Graduate School: The Good, the Grad, and the Ugly Presenter: Josephine Martell, associate dean for academics Come and learn about the top things that former graduate students wish they had known before they started their research degree programs. This session will share critical advice on setting achievable goals, creating mutual expectations with mentors, assembling an effective committee, research organization, the value of literature reviews, presenting and publishing, maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and more. In addition to a short presentation, participants will have opportunities to break into smaller groups to reflect on, and brainstorm, how to apply the guidance in their own disciplines and unique situations. Exploring Career Options In and Outside Academia: Make an Action Plan for Your Future Presenters: Susi Varvayanis, executive director of Careers Beyond Academia, and Christine Holmes, director of postdoctoral studies You might be thinking it is too early to think about the end as you are starting, but in this session you will learn how important it can be to keep your options open, how you can take advantage of your time at Cornell to gain experiences that help you rule in or rule out different career sectors based on what you value and in what environments you thrive. You will leave with three things you can do that don’t take long at all that will increase your agency.

Fall 2020 Sessions Coping with 2020: Resiliency for International Scholars With so many stressors associated with events that are beyond the control of any person, it is easy to understand why international scholars, in particular, may feel vulnerable, anxious, and isolated, especially in light of the recent U.S. election. The goal is for students and postdocs to leave with an understanding of best practices to prioritize your health and well-being, the importance of community, and what you can do today to strengthen your resiliency. This session is open for all, but will focus on the needs of our international community.

Presenter: Catherine Thrasher- Carroll, M.A., mental health promotion program director, Skorton Center for Health Initiatives The Importance of Meaning-Making During Uncertainty Congratulations – you are becoming an expert in your research/scholarly pursuits as a graduate student! Does that feel like it is enough for you? During times of uncertainty, do you find yourself questioning the value of your work? It is human nature to have deep questions of value and worth which can be amplified at times when stressors are so great and making an impact on you, but you don’t know where to begin. This session is designed to consider one’s meaning and purpose while examining the interconnected nature of humanity. Join us to unearth what happens during times of crisis and strategies for how you can explore and regain a commitment back to you, as a whole person. Presenter: Oliver Goodrick, associate dean for spirituality and meaning making, director, Cornell United Religious Work It’s Complicated:  Family and Friends and Differences We have witnessed a divide among perspectives, opinions, and judgments recently in the United States leading up to the national election. And, our family and friends may not share the same ideas leaving us to feel confused, concerned, and alone.

Kristina Smiley Wins 2017 3MT Kristina Smiley “If I asked you what this bird, this fish, and this new mom all had in common, you probably wouldn’t say that they all feed their offspring with milk,” began Kristina Smiley, a doctoral student in psychology, in her Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation on her research into prolactin, a hormone produced in new mothers. Smiley went on to win this year’s 3MT competition and was awarded the first-place ($1500) prize on March 29th. Winning second place, Prateek Sehgal, a doctoral student in mechanical and aerospace engineering, presented on using sound waves to separate cancer particles. Prateek Sehgal The People’s Choice prize was awarded to Xiangkun “Elvis” Cao, a doctoral student in mechanical and aerospace engineering, for his presentation on the fever phone, an app that can diagnose illness. “We in the Graduate School, along with our judges from across campus, were much impressed with the innovative research and remarkable presentation skills of our participants,” said Jan Allen, associate dean of academic and student affairs and the event’s organizer. 3MT is a competition developed by the University of Queensland in 2008 that challenges graduate students to present their research in three minutes to a non-specialist audience. Competitors are scored based on audience engagement, audience comprehension, and their own communication skills.

Campus What can I do to prepare for being away from campus in regards to mental health? If I am away from campus, can I still use Cornell Health services? How can I make sure I have a support network when I am away from campus? What can I do to prepare myself mentally for in absentia status or travel? How do I handle health insurance issues when away from campus? Which resources should I be familiar with before leaving the U.S.? What can I do to prepare for being away from campus in regards to mental health? If you know that mental health is a concern for you, our number one recommendation is to plan ahead. Consider the mental health support you will need well in advance of your move. Make an appointment with your mental health and/or medical care providers to talk about your plans for travel and/or relocation. (If you are traveling abroad, consider also consulting with Cornell Health Travel Services .) Will you need professional services in your new location? Would it help to have copies of certain health records? Can your current providers or health insurer help you identify resources and/or referrals? Though Cornell Health does not have the capacity to provide telehealth services, some private therapists and commercial services do offer remote counseling. If you take prescription medications, make sure you have what you need before you go, as well as a plan for getting refills. If I am away from campus, can I still use Cornell Health services? Students who are not in the Ithaca area may call Cornell Health at 607-255-5155 to consult with a health care provider about a medical or mental health concern (24/7 for emergencies and urgent concerns). Even from afar, they can help you determine what care you need and how and when to get it. How can I make sure I have a support network when I am away from campus? Connect with people who care about you. Talk before you go with friends, family, mentors, or advisors, and make specific plans for connecting on a regular basis. Do you have the apps you need on your phones and computers? If you’re going abroad, how will you navigate living in different time zones? Can you put into words how they can be helpful to you? Can you ask how you might be helpful to them? It may be difficult now to know how you will connect with people in your new location, but it might help to start imagining it…and asking others to share experiences they have had. What can I do to prepare myself mentally for in absentia status or travel? Prioritize self-care. Shifting to in absentia status, pursuing research abroad, and traveling to or living in a new location can be disruptive. It’s important to make a list now of what you already know to be key strategies for taking care of yourself, and then use it in your new location: “Advice to Self.” Some of those strategies should be part of your routine (such as eating right, moving your body, getting enough sleep, socializing, engaging in mindfulness/meditation/prayer). You also have a pretty good idea of what helps you when you are in crisis…or feel one coming on. Write them down so you can turn to them without thinking in times of need. You might consider attaching to your list some of the behaviors you know are “high risk” for you (e.g., too much or not enough alone time, screen time, work time, sleep time; self-medicating in one way or another to “manage” feelings; etc.). How do I handle health insurance issues when away from campus? Understand your health insurance before you need to use it. This will take some work. Go to your insurer’s website or talk with a member services representative to learn about how your plan works in the area you will be living/traveling. If you are enrolled in Cornell’s Student Health Plan (SHP), your plan will work the same anywhere in the United States . If you’re studying outside the U.S., your copays and co-insurance won’t change, but you may have to pay for care at the time services are provided and submit a claim for reimbursement . SHP also includes 24/7 worldwide travel assistance whenever you’re more than 100 miles from your permanent address, in the U.S. or abroad. This is robust coverage (more than just insurance), so take the time to review it before you travel. Which resources should I be familiar with before leaving the U.S.? If you will be out of the U.S., review Cornell’s health insurance requirements for students traveling abroad . Make sure you register with Cornell’s International Travel Registry before you go. In the event of an emergency, the Travel Registry helps university officials to reach you and provide assistance. Global Cornell provides information about health, safety, and other important considerations for all Cornellians planning international travel.

Biology Ph.D. Candidate Wins Three Minute Thesis Competition Bhargav Sanketi’s winning presentation. “My thesis explores the blueprint behind building a small intestine. I call it ‘to be or “knot” to be’,” began Bhargav Sanketi, a doctoral candidate in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, at the sixth Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Sanketi presented his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of judges and an audience from across campus. Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly they summarized their research using only one static slide to a general audience. His presentation, “To be or ‘knot’ to be: Blueprint for a small intestine,” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to food science and technology doctoral candidate Rachel Allison for her presentation, “What CAN we do about stinky wine?” After nearly 200 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $300 were presented to entomology doctoral candidate Kara Fikrig for her presentation, “Are mosquitoes picky eaters?” Having enjoyed the 3MT as an audience member in the past, Sanketi appreciated the opportunity to participate in – and win – this year’s competition. “I think as scientists, we get so lost in our work that it’s easy to lose sight of what’s important,” he said. “I had attended previous editions of 3MT and always found them really entertaining. The idea of getting a diverse audience excited about a pretty heavy academic topic forces you to zoom out and see the big picture.” For Allison, undertaking the challenge of distilling a dense topic into accessible and engaging content was a primary motivator for her participation. “Going through the job interview process, I realized how challenging it could be to communicate my research experience to a non-specialist audience,” she said. “My career goal is to one day combine technical and business consulting in the wine industry, and adaptable communication skills will be essential. As a result, I have been trying to practice by taking advantage of more speaking opportunities.” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 600 graduate schools in over 65 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015. The event has grown steadily since that time and this year, Cornell’s winner will compete in the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools regional competition next month, and the top two winners from that event will showcase their research at the Council of Graduate Schools annual meeting in December 2021. “I am so impressed with each and every one of this year’s competitors,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “They are all to be recognized for their successful presentations. In addition to presenting their complex research in just three minutes, everyone rose to the challenge of doing so in a virtual format. These skills will prove beneficial in academic work as well as in future careers.” Understanding the importance of communicating scientific topics clearly, Fikrig looked at the 3MT as a way to learn techniques for getting and holding listeners’ attention when sharing her research broadly. “I value science communication and recognize the importance of being able to explain my science in a way that is both comprehensible and interesting to the public. This is especially true since I study mosquitoes – the threat of disease transmission underscores the need to effectively communicate about my study system,” she said. “After watching videos of past 3MT presenters, I thought that the competition would be a great opportunity to learn and practice science communication skills. And I was not disappointed!” Cornell’s sixth 3MT final round competition was held on Thursday, March 18, 2021 at 4:15 p.m. on Zoom. This story is also available on the Cornell Chronicle website .

What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? I think as scientists, we get so lost in our work that it’s easy to lose sight of what’s important. I had attended previous editions of 3MT and always found them really entertaining. The idea of getting a diverse audience excited about a pretty heavy academic topic forces you to zoom out and see the big picture. It feels nostalgic, like the first time I started thinking about the project and the analogies I used to understand it better. Second Place: Rachel Allison, food science and technology doctoral candidate Watch Rachel Allison’s 3MT presentation . Presentation Title: “What CAN we do about stinky wine?” Special Committee Chair : Gavin Sacks Area of Research: Wine flavor chemistry Biography: Rachel Allison is a Ph.D. candidate and aspiring consultant in the field of food science. With a focus in wine flavor chemistry, her research looks at the development of reductive off-aromas during wine storage, particularly related to the stability of enological treatments with copper and interactions between wine and aluminum can packaging. Favorite Thing About Cornell: Curiosity is always encouraged. What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? Going through the job interview process, I realized how challenging it could be to communicate my research experience to a non-specialist audience. My career goal is to one day combine technical and business consulting in the wine industry, and adaptable communication skills will be essential. As a result, I have been trying to practice by taking advantage of more speaking opportunities. I credit my lab group for helping me to develop my presentation skills over the last few years. I have always received insightful feedback from my friends and colleagues, and they encouraged me to participate in the 3MT. I received many different perspectives so I learned to interpret and condense a lot of presentation lessons alongside building the thesis story. Every comment helped me to construct an effective final product. I’m sure the experience will help me as I write my thesis. People’s Choice: Kara Fikrig, entomology doctoral candidate Watch Kara Fikrig’s 3MT presentation . Presentation Title: “Are mosquitoes picky eaters?” Special Committee Chair: Laura Harrington Area of Research: Mosquito feeding ecology Biography: Kara Fikrig studies mosquito feeding behavior and hopes that her research will help public health efforts to reduce global suffering from mosquito-borne diseases. She believes that science communication is critical to achieve that goal. As such, she is dedicated to ensuring that science is understood and valued by the public and elected representatives. Favorite Thing About Cornell: The easy access to beautiful nature! What did you learn from the 3MT? How did it help you? First, I would like to thank my family, friends, and lab for their support, both during this competition and throughout my development as a scientist. I decided to participate in the 3MT competition because I value science communication and recognize the importance of being able to explain my science in a way that is both comprehensible and interesting to the public. This is especially true since I study mosquitoes – the threat of disease transmission underscores the need to effectively communicate about my study system. After watching videos of past 3MT presenters, I thought that the competition would be a great opportunity to learn and practice science communication skills. And I was not disappointed! I learned new techniques, such as portraying enthusiasm despite being nervous, and had the opportunity to practice techniques that I had learned previously, like employing a hook to grab the listeners’ attention and using relatable metaphors. It was challenging to condense my project into three minutes – but the process of doing so helped me to realize that many of the details that I considered crucial were in fact unnecessary to understand the overarching message. The skills that I developed through participating in the 3MT competition will help me to more effectively and confidently communicate my science in the future. And I’m sure that the condensed explanation of my work will come in handy once social gatherings begin again!

Culture Ph.D. Candidate Wins Three Minute Thesis Competition Bruno Shirley’s winning presentation “So, this is a coin from 12 th century Sri Lanka. And, like many coins, it’s inscribed with the name of the monarch who commissioned it,” began Bruno Shirley, a doctoral candidate in Asian literature, religion, and culture at the seventh annual Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Shirley presented his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of judges and a virtual audience from across campus and around the world. Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. His presentation, “Constructing Buddhist kingship in medieval Sri Lanka,” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to physics doctoral candidate Vaibhav Sharma for his presentation, “What happens when atoms colder than outer space are spun around?” After nearly 100 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were presented to plant pathology and plant-microbe biology doctoral candidate Juliana González-Tobón for her presentation, “Can bacteria smell their food?” For Shirley, whose fieldwork plans were disrupted by the pandemic, entering the 3MT enabled him to reengage with his dissertation research. “These three-minute talks are more than just elevator pitches; the process helped me to really hone-in on what’s most important in my dissertation topic,” he said. “It’s so easy to lose sight of the woods for the trees when we’re deep into dissertation-land, and this was a valuable opportunity to step back and re-orient.” Sharma, while enthusiastic about his research, struggled to articulate it clearly and compellingly to friends and family in the past. Through the 3MT, he learned valuable skills about concisely summarizing his complex research. “Before 3MT, I didn’t believe I could talk about my research in just three minutes. The 3MT preparation stage was an eye-opener for me, and I realized the value of each and every sentence. There was no benefit to adding a single ‘filler’ or useless word. I learned how to cut down on verbosity and explain even difficult concepts in brief and easy to understand language. It will help me in the long run if I write shorter and better papers,” he said. “And now if anyone asks me about my research, I can just give them the link to my 3MT video.” González-Tobón wanted to enter the 3MT since she began her doctoral program and appreciated that this year’s virtual platform allowed for a larger audience. “It was a great opportunity to invite friends and family from around the world. As an international student, being able to invite everyone felt fantastic and was so heart-warming!” she said. “Also, since the finalists were both international and domestic and from several different research areas, it was amazing to see how diverse this community is and how different our expertise areas are.” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. Cornell’s winner will go on to compete in the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools 3MT competition in late April. “We are so proud of each and every one of our finalists,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “They not only gave excellent presentations, but learned important skills about research communication in the process that will benefit them as they graduate and move into new roles.” Cornell’s seventh 3MT final round competition was held on March 22, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. on Zoom.

Presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to entomology doctoral candidate Lidia Komondy for her presentation, “Seeing is Believing, if You Know Where to Look,” and after nearly 100 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were also presented to You. This year’s judges included Eldora Ellison, Ph.D. ‘94, a member of Cornell’s Board of Trustees; Kim Wagner ‘85, a member of Cornell’s Board of Trustees; Bruno Shirley, an Asian literature, religion, and culture doctoral candidate and 2022 first place winner; and Matt Ranieri ‘06, M.S. ’09, Ph.D. ‘13, president of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Alumni Association. “The presentations were fascinating and came from finalists with expertise in so many impressive and diverse research topics. It was amazing to see how impactful these research projects were to the world,” said Komondy. “This experience helped me realize how important scientific research is outside the lab and how important it is to keep the public updated on the implications of our research findings.” Kim Hochstedler, Yurong You, and Fangming Cui attend the 3MT reception at the Big Red Barn. Each of the winners agreed that participating in the 3MT was a great way to practice talking about their research in a way that engages and excites individuals outside of their fields and that the experience will influence the way they share their research going forward. “The best way to explain things is to stand in the audience’s shoes and use simple words,” said You. “Participation in 3MT will undoubtedly shape my future presentations.” Hochstedler said, “As I continue to communicate my research in future presentations and projects, I think these lessons of how to connect with an audience and explain my work succinctly will remain valuable. I now feel very prepared for the next family reunion when people ask me what I’m working on at Cornell!” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. “The 3MT is an excellent way for our doctoral students to practice communicating complex ideas to a broader audience, which is a skill beneficial not only for their time as students but for when they enter the professional world as well,” said Kathryn J. Boor, dean of the Graduate School and vice provost for graduate education. “We are so proud of each and every one of this year’s finalists.” 2023 3MT Finalists Watch the 2023 Three Minute Thesis competition finale.

2024 Three Minute Thesis Competition Meagan Sundstrom says a few words after being announced first place winner. Photo: Simon Wheeler for Cornell University “I want you to remember a time when you were in a setting where you felt like you didn’t belong. I want you to remember how you felt in that setting, maybe isolated or out of place, and how much you felt like you wanted to continue going back to that setting—probably not much. These feelings are all too familiar for undergraduate women pursuing their studies in science, and in physics specifically,” began Meagan Sundstrom, a doctoral candidate in physics at the ninth annual Cornell University Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Alongside seven other finalists, Sundstrom presented her dissertation research in just three minutes on March 20 to a panel of judges and an audience from across campus while additional friends, family, advisors, and lab mates watched online. In the first in-person Cornell 3MT since 2019, presentations were judged by how clearly and compellingly students summarized their research to a general audience, using only one static slide. Sundstrom’s presentation, “Recognizing and Removing Barriers for Women in Physics,” earned her first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to information science doctoral student Sterling Williams-Ceci for her presentation, “AI Helps us Write – but at What Cost?” After nearly 60 in-person and 70 virtual audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award and $250 were presented to biomedical and biological sciences doctoral candidate Sharada Gopal for her presentation, “Worming Our Way to a Longer Life.” This year’s judges included Jane Bunker, director of Cornell University Press; Joe Ellis, director of online degree program development at eCornell; David Lodge, the Francis J. DiSalvo Director of the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability; and Bob Riter, patient advocate for the Cornell Community Cancer Partnership. Organization of the competition and coaching of presenters was provided by the Graduate School Office of Career and Professional Development. “As grad students, there are a lot of opportunities to give your elevator pitch at conferences and more professional settings to more senior people in your field, and I thought this would be a really cool opportunity for me to try to tailor that pitch to a more general audience—how would I describe my research to my family and friends?—so that was fun,” said Sundstrom. Being able to “zoom out” and view her topic from a different perspective was also helpful for Sundstrom, who is currently writing her dissertation and appreciates having both formulated a storyline and thought about the broader impacts of her work. Williams-Ceci similarly enjoyed the chance to speak to a different type of audience than she is used to addressing. “I hadn’t really had an opportunity in grad school to try communicating to a broad audience, it’s always just to my lab, so I wanted to practice having a chance to really tell a story and not just go through the slides,” she said. “It really helped me know for a fact that I can tell a convincing story about a project that I’ve done.” 2024 Three Minute Thesis finalists. Photo: Simon Wheeler for Cornell University Gopal shared that the 3MT was a fun way to combine her longtime artistic interests with her science. “It seemed like such a fun event. I did a lot of theatre in college so I thought, ‘What can I do artistically here?’ and this seemed like a good mix of my scientific interest and my artistic theatre interests,” she said, adding that she also benefitted from looking at the bigger picture of her work and its impacts. The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 900 universities in over 85 countries. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2015 and the event has grown steadily since that time. As the winner of Cornell’s competition, Sundstrom will now go on to compete in northeast regional competitions. “Our Three Minute Thesis final round is a highlight of the year for those of us in the Graduate School—literally we talk about it all year long,” said Kathryn J. Boor, dean of the Graduate School and vice provost for graduate education. “We look forward to it because it’s just plain fun, and it’s an opportunity for us to watch and learn from our accomplished and creative graduate researchers.” “I could not possibly be more proud of the work we saw,” she said. 2024 3MT Finalists Watch the 2024 Three Minute Thesis final competition .

Credit: Phil Wilde Alongside nine other students selected from 22 preliminary round competitors, Yesudasan had to present his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of non-specialist judges, staff, and students from across campus. Presentations were judged on their comprehension, clarity, engagement, and communication style. His presentation, “What Makes a Red Potato Red?” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to genetics, genomics, and development doctoral student Shao-Pei Chou for her presentation, “Decoding the 2% Difference That Makes Us Human.” After nearly 200 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award was presented to policy analysis and management doctoral candidate Pamela Meyerhofer for her presentation, “Paid Family Leave and Fertility.” “Prior to competing, I was struggling to explain why my research was interesting to someone besides myself,” said Meyerhofer. “Having this compelling framework makes it easier to discuss and share my work.” Chou voiced similar takeaways, adding that her public speaking and communication skills were enhanced by competing. “I often found it’s difficult to explain what I’m working on to my friends and family. Even to other biologists, my field is new to them,” Chou said. “I made a decision last year that I was going to compete for the next 3MT and use that as a chance to force myself to find an … excellent way to explain my research. It worked super well!” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 600 graduate schools in over 65 countries. This year, Cornell’s winners will compete in the inaugural Ivy+ 3MT competition to be held April 25 at the United Nations (UN) in New York City. Yesudasan will also compete via video at the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools annual conference in Philadelphia in April. Finalists for 3MT 2019 with Associate Dean Jan Allen.

Credit: Phil Wilde “3MT is a wonderful opportunity for students to refine their presentation skills and translate their research into language appropriate for policymakers and others in a general audience,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “It’s always so impressive – and fun – to watch our students be so great at this!” Yesudasan and Chou look forward to the opportunity to present on behalf of Cornell at the upcoming event. “I consider it an honor and a privilege to be able to participate and represent Cornell at this inaugural event,” said Yesudasan. “I have always wanted to visit the UN, so representing Cornell as an international student at this event is extra special.” Cornell’s 5th annual 3MT final round competition was held on Wednesday, March 20, 2019 at 5:00 pm ET in Call Auditorium. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. 3MT Finalists First Place: Teddy Yesudasan , Plant Breeding & Genetics: “ What Makes a Red Potato Red? ” Special Committee Chair: Walter De Jong Second Place: Shao-Pei Chou , Genetics, Genomics & Development: “ Decoding the 2% That Makes Us Human ” Special Committee Chair: Charles Danko People’s Choice: Pamela Meyerhofer , Policy Analysis and Management: “ Paid Family Leave and Fertility ” Special Committee Chair: Francine Blau Katherine Adler , Civil & Environmental Engineering: “ Making Waves to Competitively Produce Biofuel ” Special Committee Chair: Edwin Cowen Cassandra Benson , Economics: “ Born on the Wrong Day? ” Special Committee Chair: Maria Fitzpatrick Michelle Duong , Food Science & Technology: “ Franken-phage to Save the Day ” Special Committee Chair: Sam Nugen Ashwariya Lahariya , Fiber Science & Apparel Design: “ What if Your Clothes Can Warn You of Dangerously High Carbon Dioxide Levels ” Special Committee Chair: Jintu Fan Jeffrey Pea , Biomedical & Biological Sciences: “ Oh-No Varies!

wins 2018 3MT Competition Jason Guss presenting his three-minute thesis “I’ve spent hundreds of hours collecting poop from mice,” began doctoral student Jason Guss in his Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation on his research into the relationship between the gut microbiome and bone strength. Guss, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, had three minutes to explain his complex research and its significance to a panel of student, faculty, and staff judges from units across campus. The non-specialist panel judged the presentations on their comprehension and clarity, engagement, and communication style. From the 17 students in the preliminary rounds, Guss was one of eight to make it to the final round of the Fourth Annual Three Minute Thesis Competition. The reaction from the audience and the combined scores of the six judges signaled Guss’s first place win of $1,500. Derek Holyoak, also a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, placed second, winning $1,000 for his presentation, “OA, No Way: A Simple Approach to Treat Osteoarthritis (OA).” The 150-member audience tied Holyoak and Guss for the $500 People’s Choice Award. “The 3MT gave us an opportunity to let loose and have fun while presenting our research,” Holyoak said. “I plan to continue using the enthusiasm, humor, and actions I included in my 3MT for all of my future research and teaching presentations.” The first 3MT competitions took place in 2008 as the University of Queensland. Since that time, over 600 graduate schools in 65 countries host competitions to celebrate the innovative research of their graduate students. Cornell’s Graduate School first hosted a 3MT competition in 2012. Since that time, the event has grown steadily. This year’s winners were invited to present for Cornell’s Board of Trustees. Derek Holyoak and Jason Guss Jan Allen, associate dean of academic affairs for the Graduate School, said the competition provides an important professional development opportunity. Students are challenged to distill years of specialized research into a compelling and brief talk for general audiences, a valuable skill for students entering any future career. “We have such an enjoyable time watching our graduate students present their three-minute talks,” she said. “We are so amazed and excited by the innovative scholarship and research our students are conducting. And they each have such a supportive ‘fan club’ in the audience. It’s fun to watch their friends and colleagues urge them on, too.” According to finalist Carol-Rose Little, a doctoral student in linguistics, “it is very easy to be so involved in our research that we forget the bigger picture. The 3MT competition had tremendous value as it helped me think about how to effectively communicate my bigger-picture research results and impacts to the public. It was also a fun and rewarding challenge to present to a nonspecialized audience.” 3MT Finalists Jason Guss – My “Theces” on Feces May Make Your Bones Stronger – Biomedical Engineering Special Committee Chair: Christopher Hernandez Derek Holyoak – OA, No Way: A Simple Approach to Treat Osteoarthritis (OA) – Biomedical Engineering Special Committee Chair: Marjolein van der Meulen Hugo Milan – Cool Technologies for Happier Cows – Biological & Environmental Engineering Special Committee Chair: Kifle Gebremedhin Carol-Rose Little – What Can the Ch’ol Language Tell Us About Grammar? – Linguistics Special Committee Chairs: Miloje Despic & Sarah Murray Sabrina Solouki – Vaccines Build Armies – Immunology & Infectious Disease Special Committee Chair: Avery August Mengran Wang – Three Photon Microscopy – Seeing Deeper Inside the Brain – Graduate Field of Biophysics Special Committee Chair: Chunhui Xu Divya Shiroor – Regeneration 101: Lessons from Flatworms – Molecular & Integrative Physiology Special Committee Chair: Carolyn Adler William Pennock – Better Models Lead to Better Water Treatment Designs for the World – Civil & Environmental Engineering Special Committee Chair: Leonard Lion 3MT 2018 Finalists Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ Ɂ (the Cayuga Nation).

[Opening Plenary] Keep Moving Forward – Understanding Motivation Travis Winter, LCSW-R Motivation is simply the desire or willingness of someone to do something, but how do you maintain motivation throughout your graduate program? Join us to learn about your own values, how motivation works, and different types of motivation. Determine what strategies you can employ to keep your motivation and, equally important, what to do if your motivation starts to wane. As simple as motivation is, you need to be prepared that graduate study is not a sprint, but a marathon. [Concurrent Session A1] Planning a Large Writing Project Michelle Cox, Ph.D. Dr. Michelle Cox has led programs for faculty and student writers and currently directs Cornell’s English Language Support Office. During this workshop, she will walk you through strategies for planning large writing projects, such as journal articles, grant proposals, theses, and dissertations.

June 4, 2020 Part II (11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.) Workshop: Facing an Uncertain Future Without Losing Yourself Mia Tootill, M.A. ’13, Ph.D. ’17 (musicology), LMSW, CMT-P, psychotherapist and mindfulness teacher Session Summary: With many challenges upon us, it is easy to lose our drive and desire, forgo meaningful connections with others, and question everything around us. Being a graduate student today can be particularly overwhelming, due to the already tenuous nature of the job market, the ever-pervasive “imposter syndrome”, and increased unknowns of how academia will be affected by the coronavirus crisis. It has become more important than ever to be able to see ourselves in a more expansive way, not solely as academics or defined by our intelligence, but as humans who each have unique contributions to share with the world. From this viewpoint, we can approach the future from a place of strength and resilience, knowing that we can face whatever obstacles arise. Join alumna and psychotherapist Dr. Mia Tootill who will take us through an interactive and reflective process to reaffirm our core selves and to address common blocks to validating our self-worth and overcoming the shame spiral. She will offer tools from psychological and mindfulness research and speak from her own personal and professional experiences as someone who navigated these challenges successfully herself and is now helping others do the same. If you are interested more specifically in psychotherapy as a profession, Dr. Tootill will be available after the talk from 12:00 – 12:30 p.m. to answer questions about career transitions. Part III (1:00 pm – 2:00 pm) Workshop: Reframing Yourself for Your Job Search Denise DiRienzo, Ed.D. experiential program director, Careers Beyond Academia Session Summary: This session will be focused on Ph.D. students and postdocs in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Do you ever wonder how your skills could transfer to multiple career pathways? Bring your computer, spirit of adventure, and a job advertisement or description of your dream job to this workshop where we will explore career options, strategies, and techniques to prepare for employment opportunities in multiple sectors beyond academia.

Symposium Sessions Summer 2019 P2S Symposium Sessions Opening Plenary: Why You Should Be Communicating Your Research With All Audiences Bruce Lewenstein, Ph.D. Professor of science and technology at Cornell University Many funders require you to demonstrate “broader impacts.” That often gets translated to “give public talks.” And learning to communicate with diverse audiences is often sold as a “soft skill” useful no matter what direction your career goes. But a richer reason is that communication is the essence of scholarship. Your research doesn’t become reliable knowledge until multiple audiences have heard it, played with it, reacted to it, engaged with you about it. In the process, you learn to identify what’s important about your work. You also gather information from multiple sources, get new ideas, new perspectives, new insights. Oh, yeah, and along the way you get some useful professional skills and satisfy your funders. Career Panel Discussion: Careers Leveraging Your Communication Skills Ray Jayawardhana, Ph.D. Moderator, dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at Cornell University Oné Pagán, Ph.D. Panelist, professor of biology at West Chester University Melanie Dreyer-Lude, M.F.A.

Panelist, research and instruction librarian at Catherwood Library and lecturer at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University Kate Addleman-Frankel The Gary and Ellen Davis Curator of Photography, Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University Workshop: The Craft of Revision Rachael Cayley, Ph.D. Associate professor at the Graduate Centre for Academic Communication, University of Toronto In this session, we will discuss strategies for revising academic writing. I will begin by framing revision as the most powerful route to better writing. The ability to revise our own writing improves not just the final writing product, but also the writing process. Having a good handle on revision helps us get started with a writing project and then move through the multiple iterations necessary for strong final drafts. We will consider different types of revision and establish the optimal way to sequence the revision process. Throughout this presentation, there will be opportunities to raise writing questions and to practice relevant strategies. Academic writing is a crucial and challenging aspect of the research process; during our time together, we will explore why it is so hard and how revision can help us become more confident writers. Workshop: Communicating Professional Boundaries – When and How You Can Say No! Janna Lamey Assistant dean for graduate student life at Cornell University Marika Nell Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University To manage your most valuable resource, time, you have to balance your professional and personal priorities. Since you cannot do everything, you need to learn when and how to say no. Through small-group discussion, we will describe common barriers associated with saying no and develop a list of criteria to help you determine when to say no. Finally, leave the session with strategies that can help you be more confident and effective in the art of saying no to others.

Offers Protect Your Good Name Protect Your Good Name Accepting a job offer means that you have made a commitment to join an organization. Once you submit your letter of acceptance, you should withdraw from all pending job searches. If you are tempted to accept an offer and continue hunting for something better, that is a signal that something about the offer is not right for you, and you should not accept it. The way you handle such decisions reflects your values, priorities, and ethical/professional conduct and will contribute to your professional reputation. Employers sometimes will withdraw an offer if they learn that you are continuing the job search. Your behavior also affects future relationships between the employer and Cornell.

and Beyond… Dr. Sharon Milgram, Director of Intramural Training and Education, National Institutes of Health View recording of plenary session Session Summary: To successfully navigate the academic structure as a graduate student and postdoc, you must learn how to become an advocate for yourself. As with most skills, understanding yourself is essential to determine what is most important to you. Equally important to being a self-advocate is to learn how to assert yourself. Regardless of where you land as a professional, self-advocacy and assertiveness are skills primed to help support you in your future career aspirations. Join us for what will be an investment of time that will help you think through your strengths and weaknesses to help you develop as a researcher/scholar in working with other people in systems of power and hierarchy. The session with Dr. Milgram will provide some background information, opportunities to learn more about yourself, and a chance for open discussion with peers. Speaker Bio: Dr. Sharon Milgram received a B.S. degree in physical therapy from Temple University and a Ph.D. in cell biology from Emory University. She completed postdoctoral training at The Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, she rose to the rank of full professor in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. Dr. Milgram served as the associate director of the Medical Scientist Training Program, director of the Interdisciplinary Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, and the director of the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience. In 2007 she joined the NIH Office of the Director as the director of the Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) where she directs a trans-NIH Office dedicated to the career advancement of over 5,000 trainees. Dr. Milgram lectures widely on science careers, mentorship, leadership, management, wellness, and resilience in research environments. She lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with her wife and son.

Eliza’s proprietary methodology empowers people to claim space through enhanced actionable communication skills. This results in more equitable collaborations, and confident, innovative thought leadership. Speaker Bio: Eliza VanCort is a best-selling author, speaker, thought leader, and teacher. Her b est-selling book (#1 on Amazon’s Best Sellers List), “ A Woman’s Guide To Claiming Space: Stand Tall, Raise Your Voice, Be Heard “ offers a “how-to” for a fuller life with actionable tools – from posture to imposter syndrome, interruptions to mansplaining, anti-mentors to cheerleaders, and everything in between! Eliza’s speaking engagements and workshops cover a wide variety of topics, including voice, body language, intersectionality, claiming space, whiteness, allyship, and more to create an environment where folks can talk authentically and build community within and outside of their respective organizations. Part III (2:00 pm to 3:30 pm ET) Workshop: Resilience in Writing – The Key to Graduate Writer Wellbeing and Success Dr. Lisa Russell-Pinson, Associate Teaching Professor of Writing, Center for Graduate Life, the Graduate School, UNC Charlotte Session Summary: When graduate students think about improving their writing, their attention typically turns to ensuring that their texts have well-supported arguments, clear organization, and logical transitions. While these are essential components of effective academic texts, another aspect of writing is just as—or perhaps even more—vital to graduate writing success: writer well-being. Writer well-being includes the “long-term, optimal social and emotional health” of writers (Cochran & Miller-Cochran, 2019), and recent studies point to writer well-being as integral to academic achievement and satisfaction. One hallmark of writer well-being is the ability to respond resiliently to challenges in writing (Russell-Pinson & Harris, 2019; Russell-Pinson, forthcoming). Drawing from the research on writing and well-being, this interactive session will introduce writers to concrete ways of building resilience in their own academic writing processes to bolster their academic achievement and satisfaction in graduate school. Speaker Bio: Lisa Russell-Pinson, Ph.D. is associate teaching professor of writing in the Graduate School at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In this role, she teaches writing classes to matriculated graduate students and develops and delivers support programming for doctoral writers. Dr. Russell-Pinson’s current research focuses on doctoral students’ experiences in the dissertation process, especially factors that impede dissertation-writing progress and interventions that help writers succeed. Her most recent work on academic writing has been published in the Journal of Second Language Writing (2019), Learning from the Lived Experiences of Graduate Student Writers (2020), and Mentorship in Scholarly Publication: Narratives and Practices (forthcoming). Dr. Russell-Pinson earned her B.A. cum laude in English from the University of South Carolina at Columbia and her M.S. and Ph.D. in linguistics from Georgetown University. She has taught English in the U.S. and varied settings abroad, including the Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Slovakia, and Spain. Based on her professional experience and expertise, Dr. Russell-Pinson was selected as an English Language Program Specialist by the U.S. Department of State in 2022.

Contact for questions: grad_assoc_dean@cornell.edu Registration (9:30 – 10:00 am) Welcome (10:00 – 10:15 am) Opening Plenary Workshop (10:15 – 11:45 am) Leadership Visioning Speaker: Dr. Theoria Cason, CEO at Theoria in Praxis, and Director of Diversity & Inclusion at Ubisoft for Global Publishing Session Summary The characteristics of leadership are not exclusive to the most senior ranking persons within an organization; they are characteristics that any person can embody. Establishing a sentiment of safety, requires authenticity and vulnerability. This can be achieved by stepping outside of oneself to learn about the lived experiences of others. Through reflective dialogue, this session will provide you with strategies you can employ in the future in order to strategically navigate organizational culture as part of your leadership practice. Additionally, you will develop an action plan for continued learning in aspects of inclusive leadership. Networking Lunch (11:45 am – 12:30 pm) Panel Discussion (12:30 – 1:45 pm) Faculty Who Failed – Lessons Learned for Moving Forward Session Summary Graduate school is a time for students to push themselves, try new things, and explore. It’s also a time when students are likely to experience what feels like failure.  Join a panel of faculty members who will share their stories of how they “failed” and overcame setbacks in graduate school and beyond. Through personal anecdotes, panelists will share how resilience can carry you through the tough times in your degree program and come out of the experience stronger and better prepared for future challenges. Alumni Keynote (2:00 – 3:00 pm) From Books to Space: My Journey from an English Ph.D. to a Career at NASA Speaker: Dr. Abram Coetsee, Ph.D. ’22 (Literatures in English), Project Manager, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Session Summary Many times graduate students see their career options as defined by their research specialization, and feel the stress of limited job opportunities. In this talk, our alumni keynote speaker will analyze the ways that academic experiences can be leveraged for a wide horizon of careers across many industries. Skillsets earned through intellectual passion can be creatively applied to work beyond the university—often fulfilling our missions with more impact, and realizing a broader set of dreams. About the Speaker: Dr. Abram Coetsee serves under NASA’s Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP), as a Project Manager for the NASA Community Colleges Aerospace Scholars (NCAS) team, on contract via Guardians of Honor LLC.

Offers Delay Your Response Delay Your Response Make sure you know when you need to respond to a job offer. Depending on time of year, most organizations will allow you at least a few weeks, and sometimes even a few months. If that date approaches before you complete interviewing for other positions, you can ask for an extension. But don’t wait until the last minute to request an extension, and provide a date when you will give your final decision. Example: “Thank you for the opportunity to work with (organization) as a (job title). I am very appreciative of and keenly interested in the offer. At the same time, I have committed to several organizations for second interviews, and would like to see these through to completion. I am writing to request a delay in responding until (date) to be able to collect all the information I need to reach this important decision.” Employers are more likely to offer time extensions during the fall semester than during the spring semester.
